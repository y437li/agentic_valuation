Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Alan Greer of Investor Relations for BB&T Corporation. Alan Greer : Thank you, Felicia. And good morning, everyone, and thanks to all of our listeners for joining us today. We have with us Kelly King, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Daryl Bible, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review the results for the first quarter and provide a look ahead. We also have other members of our executive management team who are with us to participate in the Q&A session; Chris Henson, our Chief Operating Officer; Ricky Brown, the President of Community Banking; and Clarke Starnes, our Chief Risk Officer. We will be referring to a slide presentation during our comments today. A copy of the presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on our website. Before we begin, let me remind you that there may be statements made during the course of the call that express management\u2019s intentions, beliefs or expectations. BB&T\u2019s actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. I refer you to the forward-looking statement warnings in our presentation and our SEC filings. Our presentation also includes certain non-GAAP disclosures. Please refer to page 2 and the appendix of our presentation for the appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Kelly. Kelly King : Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everybody, and thanks also for joining our call and your interest in BB&T. So, I\u2019d say overall given our normal seasonality and the substantial reduction in mortgage volume, we had a really solid quarter, some driven primarily by insurance, commercial loan growth, credit quality and excellent expense control. If you look at earnings, net income totaled $501 million versus $210 million in the first quarter of \u201913. That was diluted EPS of $0.69 and that was also after 2 one-time negative adjustments totaling $0.03 per share, which I\u2019ll give you a little detail on in just a moment. Of course, our first quarter \u201813 results were reduced by a tax related adjustment of $281 million. If you look at revenue, revenues were $2.3 billion and that was seasonally lower as you would expect. Results were driven by higher insurance revenues, higher trust and investment advisory revenues offset somewhat by lower net interest margin and a decline in mortgage banking income. Our fee income ratio was very strong at 43.2%. If you\u2019re following along those lines, I\u2019m on slide 3. Commercial loan growth was very good this quarter. Average CRE income producing properties balances grew 10.6% annualized versus fourth quarter \u201813 that was led by multifamily but also we had some growth in office, retail and industrial. In the case of CRE income and construction, both of these had the best growth rate since the recession and frankly we expect them to continue have good solid growth rates. Average C&I growth was 3.6% annualized, which was driven primarily by corporate lending. Sales finance was strong, balances grew 7.3% annualized versus fourth quarter and that was primarily driven by prime auto. Average mortgage loans were a little noise there, so let me explain it to you. Mortgage loans were $8.7 billion, retail loans down by $6.6 billion, pardon me for allergies. That was really just a change relative to our QM compliance adjustments. So, we transferred $8.3 billion from retail to mortgage and that\u2019s just offsetting effect of that. And deposits : Our noninterest-bearing deposits increased $2.9 billion or 8.8%, although at linked quarter growth was only 0.5% due to seasonality. Average deposits decreased to $188 million or 0.6%. And our deposit mix improved on our cost to client 1 basis point to 0.27%, which was very pleasing. Our credit improvement continues to be a great story. Net charge-offs were 0.55% of average loan and leases. Now, core net charge-offs are 0.47%, which was down to 0.49% in the fourth. So, what happened there, we had an additional $23 million in charge-off related to a change in process in our non-prime auto portfolio; Daryl will give you more detail on that. But basically net core charge-offs went down again. Loans past due 30 to 89 and 90 declined, NPL declined, NPAs declined, so really, really good levels of credit quality and continuing to improve. We said in January that our expenses had peaked in \u201813, and would decline in \u201814. So, we delivered. Non-interest expense decreased 14.8% annualized versus the fourth quarter. Expense decline was driven by lower personnel and professional expenses. Efficiency ratio improved and we had positive operating leverage in the first quarter which we were very pleased about. We do expect continued improvement in our efficiency ratio throughout \u201814. I want you all to know, we are laser focused on expense management and we continue to re-conceptualize our businesses. A lot of the re-conceptualization processes that we developed over the last couple of years are really beginning to kick in now. And frankly, because revenue is relatively slow and probably going to be somewhat slow as mortgage continues to rebound, it\u2019s just really important to be tough on expenses and we are. So, if you turn to slide 4, with regard to the selected items, we did have an adjustment to non-controlling partnership interest of $16 million after tax which was $0.02 a share negative. We did have merger related and restructuring charges related to severance which was $5 million after tax and then it was a penny after tax impact on EPS. If you look at slide 5, let me give you a little more color with regard to the lending area. Overall, our loan demand from new business is improving. Large percentage of loan demand in the market I will say to though is refinance and shareholder friendly purposes. But our quarter was kind of interesting; it started out kind of slow, obviously mostly because of weather, volumes really accelerated late into the quarter, and that did impact some of our seasonal business like for example Sheffield start is really getting going and heading into the second quarter. That was slowed a little bit because of the weather, it\u2019s really began to pick up now. So, we\u2019ll see really good growth in that in the second quarter, so overall, really good building momentum. If you look at absolute numbers, you will see that total loans were 0.9% but taking out the covered loan run-off which you know about, the real -- normal loans were up 2.3 -- 2.1% annualized. But within that are some really good numbers. So, C&I was up 3.6%, CRE income producing was up 10.6%, CRE construction was 3.5%. So, total commercial was up 4.9%. These portfolios had really turned recently and beginning to grow for the first time in a long while but seem to have really good lives as we go forward. Again, when you look at these numbers, remember, retail is down and mortgage is up, that\u2019s just a watch, so don\u2019t pay any attention to that. Sales finance was strong and 7.3%. Other lending was down seasonally. We do expect double digit growth in those areas in the second quarter. I will point out thought that equipment finance was up 26.8% and that will likely carry on into the rest of the year. So, we\u2019re seeing strong momentum in equipment finance. So, we have a number of enhanced lending strategies that we are focusing on. I just want to mention you our specialized strategy in CRE lending is really again in production. We have over $1 billion in unfunded consortium loans which kind of speaks to continued momentum. We have a nice pipeline and our new national CRE permanent financing program which will begin in April. Large corporate lending is continuing to produce double-digit growth incremental and outstanding. Our real strategy over the last several months is paying off and wholesale lending and dealer finance continue to gain moment, we are having double-digit growth there and we expect that throughout the rest of the year. Wealth lending is a real strong story for us; it\u2019s growing fast and really becoming a major driver in our retail business. And we\u2019re gaining general traction in all of our markets but particularly key new markets like Texas and Florida. So, looking forward, we expect average loans to grow 3% to 5% in the second quarter \u201814, being led by C&I, CRE income producing and construction. Our sales finance will be strong. All the lending subsidiaries are expected to rebound strongly that would be led by insurance premium finance, small ticket consumer finance business and equipment finance. So, I\u2019d say overall lending is improving. We continue to see and believe that there has been a shift in business psychology. I mentioned this in the middle of the fourth quarter. [Businessmen] equally really started focusing on, it\u2019s time to kind of make a psychological turn and invest. And the need to invest out there is really strong. I\u2019ll just reference a comment from (inaudible) letter last week, which kind of makes this point. They were talking about the aging of buildings and equipment will drive investment this year up to 4.5% to 5% versus 1.5% in 2013. So, this is interesting. So, if you look at the average age of all fixed assets from buildings to rail equipment, machinery had lengthened to 20.3 years in 2012, highest since 1949 and they\u2019ve gotten even older. Buildings averaged 22.2 years old since the 60s. And so, as we talked about, there has not been a lot of investment in refurbishing and rebuilding and getting ready for expansion. So that are used very positively as we go forward I think with regard to momentum in terms of lending. So, we remain very focused on disciplined lending. I just want to point out that while our growth may not be as strong as some, even though we think it\u2019s still really good relative to the environment, we will be very disciplined, we are not heavy players in leverage lending business. I\u2019ll just mention to you, you may have seen an analyst data write up in last few days someone is really calling out the issues that a lot of banks would really focus a lot on large leverage lending, I\u2019m not going to comment on which banks he talked about but I will tell you that he had (inaudible) us \u201cBB&&T has been by far the most cautious with the de minimis amount of leverage loans.\u201d That is affirmation of exactly what we have been telling you. And we remain committed to long term profitable loan growth. And I didn\u2019t say we are not going to be aggressive, we\u2019re working really hard, we\u2019re going really on the streets working hard to get all the good loans, profitable loans that are out there. But we are not going to push loan growth at the expense of quality. And that\u2019s been a long standing position of BB&T and it remains so. So having said that, we have a number of enhanced strategies as I described; and another point to keep in mind, we got a lot of large real estate loans because that was a bigger part of our portfolio that are really been paying off recently. One of the good things is mathematically most of those portfolios have turned and so just mathematically with the same production their growth will go up and we are expecting final production, so that\u2019s really good news. We have a really good strong I call the action in the bank in terms of moving market share. I would say you have been traveling around talking about folks in the community bank and our corporate lending area, enthusiasm for lending is at an all time high. We are really focused on being the most responsive in the marketplace and we believe ultimately that will be the key differentiator. So we are very excited about lending as we go forward particularly. If you turn with me to slide 6, just a couple of comments with regard to deposits. Deposits are continuing to behave exactly the way we wanted to the last years, so we continue to improve our deposit mix and cost. You will notice that while non-interest bearing deposits were only 0.5% up, first quarter versus fourth because of seasonality, we did have strong organic DDA growth of 8.8% versus the first quarter and importantly our DDA mix improved to 28.2% versus 24.9% in the first quarter of \u201813. So that\u2019s a whopping big change in one year. And we again pulled our interest bearing deposit cost down by a penny and about a point to 27 basis points. I will point out though that we do think that will be relatively flat as we go forward, not a lot more downside there, because frankly, we and others are having to focus on deposit [acquisition] because of the liquidity in LCR purposes. You\u2019ll see us spend more time growing commercial and retail deposits as we run off some public funds, which has gone unfortunate, but that\u2019s the requirement of the LCR requirements, at least at this point unless they change it. So we feel good about our deposit strategy and sort of are complementary to our lending strategy. Let me turn it now to Daryl for some additional color on the numbers. Daryl? Daryl Bible : Thank you, Kelly and good morning everyone. I\u2019m going to talk about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, non-interest expense, capital and our segment results. Continuing on slide 7, we continue to see improvement in credit quality, driving lower costs and lower provision. First quarter net charge-offs, excluding covered were $156 million or 55 basis points. These numbers include $23 million in net charge-offs resulting from a process change that accelerated charge-offs in our non-prime auto business. Excluding this change, core charge-offs were 43 to 47 basis points, down slightly compared to last quarter. We are maintaining a long-term charge-off guidance of 50 to 70 basis points. But for the next few quarters, we believe charge-offs will remain below 50 basis points, assuming the economy does not deteriorate significantly. Non-performing assets excluding covered declined 6.4% during the first quarter. NPAs as a percentage of total loans were 0.54%, our lowest ratio since 2007. We expect NPAs to improve at a modest pace in the second quarter. Turning to slide 8, delinquent loans decreased in most categories as credit continues to perform very well. Our allowance to non-performing loans decreased slightly from 1.73 times to 1.7, reflecting strong coverage. We had reserve release of $80 million during the quarter excluding covered activity and a change for reserve for unfunded commitments. This compares to $67 million released last quarter excluding the same items. We expect future releases if any to be lower as credit improvement stabilize. Continuing on slide 9, margin came in at 3.52%, down 4 basis points from the fourth quarter. Core margin was at 3.29%. Our margin declined due to higher investment balances purchased in response to the new liquidity rules. For the second quarter, we expect margins to decline approximately 10 basis points. This decline results from tighter credit spreads and new originations and continued write-off of covered assets. These factors were partially offset by improved funding, mix and lower cost. Our duration of equity is a negative 55 basis points at the end of the quarter. We remain slightly asset-sensitive. Turning to slide 10, our fee income ratio for the first quarter remains fairly stable at 43.2%. Overall non-interest income decreased $74 million. This was driven by a decline in mortgage banking income, lower investment banking and brokerage fees and decline in other income. These decreases were partially offset by a strong performance in insurance. Insurance income was up $56 million over the fourth quarter due to 9% growth in commissions, stronger performance-based incentives and better information, which allowed us to report $23 million in revenue that normally would have been reported in the second, third and fourth quarters. This is not a one-time benefit, just timing. But even when you consider this, we had really strong results. We expect second quarter insurance revenues to be similar to the first quarter. Mortgage banking income declined $26 million in the quarter, primarily due to lower residential volumes and lower production of commercial mortgages. Residential gain on sale margins increased from 55 basis points in the fourth quarter to 69 basis points in the first quarter. However, origination volumes were down 29% and loan sales were 51% lower compared to last quarter. To address the lower mortgage revenues, we are taking aggressive action to align our production and origination businesses to coincide with lower volumes. Investment banking and brokerage were down seasonally this quarter to $88 million compared to record performance last quarter. FDIC loss share income offset was [worse] by $9 million compared to last quarter. This quarter\u2019s assessment of cash flow significantly changed our outlook for accretable yield and our offset going forward. We expect approximately $20 million improvement in interest income in 2014 versus our prior guidance, but approximately $80 million in greater fee income offset as we amortize the FDIC receivable. So, our net benefit for 2014 is projected to be $120 million. This is a decrease of $60 million compared to our last projections. In total, this is a positive development in cash flows. Our covered assets are performing better and our losses are down, so we will earn additional interest income on these assets over their lives but in the short run, the changed results and a reduction in the estimated recoverable cash flows from the FDIC, which will be amortized over the next couple of quarters. Other income decreased primarily due to two items, a $3 million net gain on the sale of consumer lending subsidiary last quarter and a decrease of $19 million income from assets related to certain post employment benefits, which is offset in personnel costs. Turning to slide 11, we achieved positive operating leverage which drove our efficiency ratio to 59.3% this quarter. Total noninterest expense decreased $53 million or 15% annualized compared to the fourth quarter. This decrease was led by lower personnel costs and lower professional service expense. The personnel expense decrease was mainly due to lower incentives and lower pension expense. Personnel expense included a seasonal increase of $25 million due to the annual reset of social security limits and other payroll taxes. FTEs were essentially flat compared to last quarter. Professional services declined $13 million reflecting lower legal costs and a decrease in project expenses. Merger related and restructuring charges totaled $8 million in the quarter due to severance accruals. We still plan to achieve an efficiency ratio in the 56% range in the fourth quarter of this year and we expect positive operating leverage throughout each quarter. Finally, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.3%. We expect the similar rate next quarter. As Kelly mentioned earlier our non-controlling interest included a $16 million one-time catch up adjustment which is related to certain partnership profit rights. Turning to slide 12, capital ratios remain strong and are up from the fourth quarter with Tier 1 common at 10.2% and Tier 1 at 12.1%. We also estimate the Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10%. We are looking at liquidity, we made excellent progress in the LCR ratio, which is currently 87%. If you recall we have to be at 80% by the first of next year as proposed, remember these rules are not final yet. Our liquid asset buffer is 16%, so our liquidity position is very strong. We were pleased to receive a no objection for our capital plan. We will recommend to the Board one penny increase in the quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 this will happen later this month at our regularly scheduled board meeting. And this will result in a dividend yield of approximately 2.5%. Beginning on slide 13, loan demand picked up significantly in the last four weeks in the community bank for strong growth in retail and C&I. Throughout the quarter we had strong CRE growth and we expect that to continue in the second quarter. Community banking net income totaled $217 million reasonably lower versus fourth quarter but increase from last year. Our dealer floor plan initiative has been very successful as we have grown loans 92% compared to last year and 47% compared to last quarter. We also surpassed $1 billion in outstanding balances. Also we obtained regulatory approval and expect to close our 21 branch acquisition of Citibank later this quarter. Turning to slide 14, residential mortgage net income was $63 million. The mix of refi to purchase was 34% and 66% respectively. Remember we added cost late last year due to the organizational realignment to be compliant with QM. Looking at dealer financial services on slide 15, net income was $35 million for the quarter. This is down on a linked quarter and like quarter basis as credit has normalized, resulting in an increase in loan loss provision. We continue to generate strong production in dealer finance with linked quarter loan originations of 27%. Operating margin in this segment was down slightly versus first quarter last year at 78%. On slide 16 our segment lending on net income of $59 million, production was down due to seasonality but we will achieve double digit loan growth in this segment in the second quarter. Moving on to slide 17, insurance had a strong quarter even without the benefit of a $23 million timing change we described earlier. We had good production in both retail and wholesale businesses. Net income was $75 million up 88% versus like quarter due to factors I described earlier. Same store sales excluding the process change was strong at 9% which includes profit commissions from our wholesale businesses. The EBITDA margin improved to 27% versus 25% a year ago. Recently we closed two small but strategic important insurance acquisitions. The combined revenue of these acquisitions is approximately $11 million. Turning to slide 18 our financial services segment generated $68 million in net income driven by corporate banking and wealth with growth of 18% and 20% respectively on a like quarter basis. Total invested assets increased $114 billion or 12% annualized growth compared to last quarter. We will continue to drive stronger revenues in the future. In closing we see additional modest credit improvement, continued expense leverage stronger loan growth and improved fee income production. And with that let me turn it back over to Kelly for closing remarks and Q&A. Kelly King :  Thank you, Daryl. So I think you can see why we say it\u2019s our solid quarter, we did have great credit quality. I would point out to you, that in the CCAR fed\u2019s stress test of all the commercial banks that was [first] we had the level [four] jobs and the base net income, projected through that cycle, so that was a very, very good and affirms our high quality credit portfolio. We are building long momentum with these enhanced strategies, we have excellent expense control, we have strong fee income, particularly in insurance which is really material and becoming a very, very positive stores [with their] forward. We do believe the market is improving and while it\u2019s not overly robust it is definitely getting better and we saw a really strong improvement as we headed though the end of the first quarter and we think that will carry out through the rest of the year. So we\u2019re excited about the improvement in market and we\u2019re focused on excellent execution and think we will have really good results as we go forward. Now I will turn it over to Alan. Alan Greer : Thank you, Kelly. This time we will ask Felicia to come back on the line and explain the Q&A process. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Alan Greer : Go ahead Felicia that\u2019s fine. Operator :  Thank you. (Operator Instructions). We\u2019ll go first to Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Hi good morning. Kelly King :  Good morning. Alan Greer :  Good morning. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley :  Nice to see the expenses really appreciate that. My question is on CCAR and Kelly you talked a little bit about that in your closing remarks and it looks to me like you graded yourself very harshly, I mean in some cases you were even more conservative than the fed. And with your strong capital ratios, the question is why so conservative on [the ask] with no buyback request, I guess I\u2019m wondering what you think, you need to see in order to turn that buyback request back on? Kelly King : Well Betsy, that's an obviously good question. To be very honest, coming off of our negative experience last year, my strategy was to be absolutely very conservative and take no risk with regard to this process. As you know and from recent revelations it's a somewhat challenging process. And I just simply did not want to take any risk. Although I will admit that does set up a positive opportunity as we head into \u201815 and that's what we were trying to set up. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : And do you think there is any possibility of going back in for a resubmit or separately do you take the excess capital that you're generating now and use it in asset allocation maybe going after parts of the loan market that others can't because they are tied around capital? Kelly King : Yes. So I think the latter, Betsy will be more likely. We always have the option to go in for special request as circumstances justified. And I will point out that we did say in our application that if we were to get a recovery on the Star transaction that that gives us opportunity with regard to buybacks or special dividends. But more likely, you would find us being more aggressive with some of these strategies to lever up that additional capital. I still think that we have best [pay grade] for our shareholders and that's what we would focus first on. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay. Thanks so much. Kelly King : You bet. Operator : We'll go next to Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Gerard Cassidy - RBC: Thank you. Good morning Kelly and good morning Daryl. Kelly King : Hey Gerard. Gerard Cassidy - RBC: When you guys look at your capital levels, obviously they are very healthy. And as you just addressed with the CCAR, how does acquisitions, Kelly, play into this. There has been apparently a low activity with the bigger banks. What\u2019s your view on the next 12 to 18 months of the M&A market? Kelly King : Gerard I think, we\u2019re all trying to figure kind of where that\u2019s going on, obviously there is nothing going on today except this small in. I don\u2019t think you will see much activity in the near-term, Gerard, but a little bit different with some people I don\u2019t think markets will shutdown forever either. I think as the Fed gets comfortable with to seek our process, banks with strong capital like BB&T and banks frankly don\u2019t part with any systemic risk, we\u2019ll have the opportunity to look at the combinations as we look forward. I think that\u2019s a good healthy long-term thing for BB&T because we\u2019re really good at it. But I just want to always reinforce that when we talk about acquisitions that we are not going to take substantially dilutive acquisitions, we just not want to do it, it\u2019s not helpful to our shareholders that doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t look at acquisitions, but we look it along, we have to do much as you know from my tenure as CEO. And so we\u2019ll be very cautious and careful. We\u2019ll keep looking. It\u2019s not out of the question for the long-term, but don\u2019t expect much in the short-term. Gerard Cassidy - RBC: You mentioned systemic risk, how do you, I think most people would agree our four largest banks are too big to fail. Do you know where in your eyes is the cut off line where you\u2019d become a systemic risk bank? Kelly King : Gerard I think that everybody is including the Fed, personal opinion, is trying to figure this out. But what I personally think right now is, up to $500 billion is kind of a clear non-systemic level. I think a trillion and above is clearly systemic. I think going 500 and a trillion nobody kind of knows. But when you go over $500 billion you\u2019re heading into the territory, you\u2019re heading into a question that is more likely to be more pressure on systemic question. So that\u2019s the reason 180 or so we could double and still be the size of U.S. bank. And so we\u2019ve got lots of opportunity before we even get to that kind of a slow if I could say 500 level. Gerard Cassidy - RBC: Great. And then just finally coming back to the Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III, clearly you guys are very strong at 10%. Once, let\u2019s say at the end of 2015 all the issues from the past for the industry are behind us, where do you think you will be comfortable in carrying that Basel III Tier 1 common ratio if the requirement for regional banks like yours is 7%, obviously you are not going to have it that low, but what\u2019s the comfort level? Kelly King :  Well, we like everybody are still trying to finalize how we settle that all [incomes]. Your capital level has something to do with your liquidity level and we have all that final numbers there. So, we will be conservative Gerard as you know in capital, but it\u2019s something less than 10 and you know it\u2019s in the 9ish area we think for the current period and what is 9.5 or what is 9, you just kind of ends on how we feel about these other factors. Gerard Cassidy - RBC: Thank you. Kelly King : Sure. Operator :  We\u2019ll go next to Paul Miller of FBR. Paul Miller - FBR:  Yes. Can you clarify on your NIM? When you\u2019re talking about a 10 basis points decline in NIM, were you talking about the headline NIM or the operating or core NIM? Daryl Bible :  Yes Paul, this is Daryl. I would tell you that we are talking about our GAAP NIM going down from 352 to 342. Paul Miller - FBR:  And what about any guidance on the core NIM, the 329? Daryl Bible :  I would say approximately half of that amount. So we were 329 on core and we are probably down about 5 on core margin. I think as you look at core margin going forward, it should start to stabilize, but we are just seeing a little bit tighter credit spreads right now in some of our lending categories specifically C&I and prime auto. Paul Miller - FBR: So, I mean when you\u2019re talking about, so should we see a continued pressure given the current environment throughout the year at this current rate? Daryl Bible : When we are forecasting our margin right now, we are forecasting current spreads that we\u2019re seeing right now not any further decline. So, we have a nickel going down on core margin next quarter and then it\u2019s starting to stabilize after that quarter. Paul Miller - FBR: And then on the mortgage front, have you seen any pick up at all in your pipelines on the purchased product? Kelly King : That is kind of moving around Paul right now, but I would say there has not been a substantial pick up in the activity, but certainly purchase is dramatically versus refi. So, if you look at purchase only as a way out, if you look at the total, it\u2019s not going to drive the total. So, our purchase is about 65% of our product today which is really good, because we think what you did into the spring, it has been a tough winter; people didn\u2019t get out of the houses to look for houses. You get into a spring people could be back out looking for houses despite that our percentage is much higher on purchase as well for some momentum pick up. Daryl Bible : Yes. Just to add to that I would say that our revenue should pick up to be similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter. I just did what Kelly said about the purchase and seasonal activity in the second. Paul Miller - FBR: Okay guys. Thank you very much. Kelly King : Sure. Operator : We will go next to Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Erika Najarian - Bank of America : Yes, good morning. Kelly King : Good morning. Erika Najarian - Bank of America : Just a question on the loan growth for the rest of the year, sorry I haven\u2019t heard you two. Kelly, your color on both on the business psychology and what your teams are doing in terms of their aggression, they are both very upbeat. As when you look for loan growth for the balance of the year, is it fair to assume that we\u2019ll continue to see the quarterly acceleration in loan growth like you\u2019re predicting for the second quarter of the year versus first quarter? Kelly King :  Yes. I think that will continue to build as regard we go through the year, again because it is business confidence. By the way, one thing I failed to mention earlier, I think it\u2019s pretty indicative of business confidence. I just read this yesterday, so business survey, and employers expect to have 8.6% more college graduates this year. Last year when they asked them that question, it was 2.1%. So when you look at all these factors, there are clearly a lot of green shoots out there in terms of building momentum. Erika Najarian - Bank of America :  Got it. And just a follow-up question on the efficiency ratio, we appreciate the color on 56% range for the fourth quarter this year. As we look out to 2015, I know it\u2019s a little bit early but assuming no major shift in the rate environment in the first half of \u201815, are you expecting to essentially hold the line in the mid 50s efficiency ratio regardless of the revenue environment? Kelly King : Well, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s [true] to be honest or get anybody to say that they are going to be holding their expense expectation independent of revenue, because obviously the fixed ratio is the function of expenses and revenue. And so if your revenue were decline a lot, you just say well, I\u2019m going to absolutely hit a certain efficiency target that would -- you could completely destroy your franchise. So, we\u2019re not independent in terms of revenue. However, having said that, as I think about \u201815, I think about revenues to have a positive upward momentum. I think business is really strong. I think margins, it will be better set by more loan demand, more loan demand that you have more opportunity to have a little firmness in pricing. So, as you see all of that, that looks to me like some comfort in terms of positive revenue change and with our really tight focus on expenses which will translate into \u201815. Then I have a lot of comfort in the 56 range and I think as you head into \u201815, you could see a little bit of downward pressure below that. Erika Najarian - Bank of America : Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Steve Scinicariello of UBS. Steve Scinicariello - UBS: Good morning everyone. Kelly King : Good morning. Daryl Bible : Good morning. Steve Scinicariello - UBS: I just wanted to follow-up with you just given the strength in the insurance income line and that you have bolted on a couple of other franchises lately. Just kind of curious what kind of the outlook might be from here, both from an organic side and inorganic side and maybe kind of interplay between what we should expect going forward. Chris Henson : Hey Steve, this is Chris Henson. I appreciate the question. We are very excited about what takes place in insurance we sort of saw this couple of years ago beginning to play out. And so, what you got really is sort of price improvement sort of in 3% to 3.5% range and you have got sort of new business growth in the 1% to 2%. And then we talked about some time ago, as those begin to play, as the economy improves, we also benefited from performance based commissions from really all businesses retail, wholesale, MGU et cetera. And that could range anywhere in the 1% to 1.5% range. So kind of looking forward, you could see a market this year in the 6 maybe even 6 plus kind of growth rate. And that kind of breaks down in retail and wholesale kind of as follows, retails run in probably about 5% just kind of run rate growth looking forward, wholesale is probably in the 9% kind of range and those mixes kind of roll out of there 6 plus kind of range. So, it really continues to perform we think with sort of underpinnings of the 2 revenue opportunities that we have which is cross-sell life insurance to wealth or broker dealer and P&C clients as well as the EB opportunity, employee benefits from a company we rolled a couple of years, we are now rolling out a plan, we got the whole footprint is -- we\u2019re feeling very, very positive about the whole business. Steve Scinicariello - UBS: It definitely sounds like very exciting opportunity, you think you might be able to bolt-on some more of these franchises as well are there more opportunities like those out there too? Chris Henson :  I think there could be -- the good news is I don\u2019t think we have to do anything significant. Kind of where we are focused today, we have all the major pieces today. We are about half wholesale, half retail which takes the volatility out of earnings. So it really kind of gives you the good kind level, return to level out to the earnings kind of going forward. We also have dominant market share in Crump life and we have the largest wholesaler in the country. So, we don\u2019t need any big pieces but to your point there are to fill in, we can do within the community bank footprint which is kind of what Woodberry was and then we particularly could have some competency areas like (inaudible) with respect to aviation. We didn\u2019t have a competency there that gave us the ability. So you could see some small fill-ins kind of looking forward. Steve Scinicariello - UBS: Perfect. And then just changing gears, I know the asset sensitivity dip down a little bit just kind of the funding side, mix shift over there. Are there any things you guys might look to do to kind of start to increase the asset sensitivity over the next couple of quarters? Daryl Bible : Yes. Steve, what we\u2019re really focused on is growing our core deposits. As we grow our core deposits that will give us more flexibility on the balance sheet because of the optionality and the betas that we project there. So, I think as we continue to build out and add to that that should kind of offset what we\u2019re seeing on the loan side organically. So, I think core deposits is really the key in the answer, it also helps a lot with our liquidity and just makes it more efficient to meet the liquidity ratios. Steve Scinicariello - UBS: Makes sense. Thank you so much. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to John Pancari of Evercore. John Pancari - Evercore: Good morning. Kelly King : Good morning. John Pancari - Evercore: In terms of the margin color you gave, how much of that core margin compression guidance factors in any incremental impact from investment securities tied to LCR? And then separately, just want to get an idea on your loan yield expectation in terms of where you\u2019re putting on new loans currently by portfolio? Thanks. Daryl Bible : Okay. So for the net interest margin piece, I\u2019d tell you that we are basically forecasting out from this point flat investment balances. So there is really not any more margin pressure related from the investment portfolio. It\u2019s really due to the just tighter credit spreads that we\u2019re seeing and our volumes that we\u2019re putting on in the loan side. Just for an example if you want to look at our C&I book, C&I, we booked about 5.5 billion new and renewing assets and the average rate on C&I was about a 231. When you look at our CRE, the average rate on the volume that we booked there, little over a 1.2 billion or 1.3 billion was around 4%. So we are seeing a little bit tighter pressures in both of those areas, but overall still really good. And from an asset sensitivity position those tend to be more floating rate, (inaudible) asset that will also help our asset risk position. John Pancari - Evercore:  Okay. All right, that\u2019s helpful. And then on the loan growth side on the C&I side, could you give us a little bit more color on the growth you are seeing there, I know you mentioned corporate banking Kelly, want to see what type of credit that is particularly if you are avoiding the whole leverage lending side of the business? And then separately on the CRE side, I know you mentioned permanent financing initiative, want to get a little bit more color there? Thanks. Clarke Starnes : Hey John this is Clarke, I\u2019ll answer that call. As far as our corporate strategy it\u2019s really aligned around the middle market segment for the industry verticals we follow. So in that regard, we are absolutely winning the high yield leverage sponsored transactions, so really do almost none of that, so most of our focus has been on these verticals. For us the growth is coming out of the area is like our energy group in Texas, REIT portfolios, agro business public finance and really strong in corporate leasing we call it equipment finance. So those are what we are seeing our best opportunities on the commercial middle market. On the CRE side, predominantly multi-family\u2019s [field] both on the construction and the permanent, but we are starting to see some retail, mostly think nice, high quality single tenant deals some office, we\u2019re actually doing a little bit of hotel and some industrial and for the first time in a long time, we also saw some residential home builder construction on very high quality there. And then finally I would say another big focal area for us that was mentioned is dealer [floor] plan has been very, very strong. John Pancari - Evercore: Okay. Great thank you. Alan Greer : Thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Ken Usdin of the Jefferies Investment Bank. Ken Usdin - Jefferies Investment Bank :  Thanks, good morning. Daryl, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more on the NII outlook. Previously you guys have talked about being able to hopefully grow core NII this year, even with the sales of the business and that you made late last year. Do you think that\u2019s still possible given the incremental core margin compression? Daryl Bible : Our rate forecast right now is for rates to moves in mid \u201815 upward and we will see how that plays out. I would say that our core margin is currently 329; we should end the year in the low 320s. So, I would say it stabilizes there. And probably doesn\u2019t move up until we really get some increases in rates, but hopefully we can get it stabilized in the low 320s. Ken Usdin - Jefferies Investment Bank : Okay. And my second question is can you just run us through the components of the purchase accounting numbers; you gave us the \u201814. If you have it on you, if you would be able to give us the pieces of how you're at least thinking of interest income and then the loss share back out for \u201814 and \u201815? Daryl Bible : Yes. So if you look at the full year 2014, the net impact will be $120 million of earnings. If you break it into the pieces, interest income is $390 million and FDIC loss share is a negative 270, let's say you get to the 120. When you get into \u201815, the benefit from the purchase accounting comes down dramatically. The net benefit of like $30 million, interest income like $190 million with the $160 million offset. So, it's pretty much out of our run rate as you get into 2015. Ken Usdin - Jefferies Investment Bank : Okay, perfect. Thank you. Daryl Bible : Welcome. Operator : We'll go to Keith Murray, ISI. Keith Murray - ISI: Thank you. Could you just spend a minute to talk about reserve release likely [doing] a linked down here, is that more a function of loan growth that you are expecting or are you seeing anything in the credit books that you think in a three-six months out whether it\u2019s delinquencies et cetera you kind of hitting a bottom here? Clarke Starnes :  Hey Keith, this is Clarke, very good question. What you are seeing for us is consistent with others and that all the higher risk managers have been burning down and that\u2019s where the releases have come from today, as our portfolio is just stabilizing and returning to a more normalized level and we would expect the provision start at some point matching charge-offs and as we grow our portfolio we would have to increase reserves at that point out. So we would certainly not expect the level of releases we\u2019ve seen over the last several quarters as we move forward, but it\u2019s not reflective of any concern at all about asset quality. In fact I would say to Kelly\u2019s point about the CCAR results and our own view of risk we think we have built a very sustainable high quality portfolio and there is nothing in our assumptions about reserves that would indicate any concerns about increased risk at this point. Keith Murray - ISI: Thank you. Kelly, maybe just a broader M&A question, when you think about bank M&A today you have done a lot of retooling of branches and technology et cetera. Is there a concern in your mind that if you purchase a bank today sort of going to have to reinvent the technology and the branches et cetera where the costs upfront might be different than they were in the past. Is that something that you think about? Kelly King :  Yes Keith, we think a lot about that. I would tell you we are not as aggressive as some people are about the eminent [demise] of the branches and everybody just want technology and all that although we do think those are real trends, things just don\u2019t change as fast as lot of people think. But, so we tracked all of that into our acquisition model of the acquiring companies. So, depending on what the state of technology is, if it needs to be rebound we simply build that into our expected investment we have to make. And therefore we would lower the price to generate our desired level of return. So, just because they have dilapidated brand system or have (inaudible) in technology, we\u2019ll not preclude it from doing it, we would just suggest the price. Keith Murray - ISI: Thank you. And then just finally, do you have any update on where you stand in the Star\u2019s appeal process? Kelly King : No, it\u2019s still in the normal kind of process; probably fourth quarter would be our guess. We\u2019ve been surprised, it could have happened earlier, but we would guess fourth quarter. Keith Murray - ISI: Thank you very much. Kelly King :  You are welcome. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Kevin St. Pierre of Sanford Bernstein. Kevin St. Pierre - Sanford Bernstein : Good morning. Kelly, you mentioned the somewhat negative experience in last year\u2019s CCAR, but the results of the actual stress test last year were very good just like this year. So now with two straight years of strong relative performance on the stress test, is it fair to say that if we\u2019re sitting here next year and you had 11% Tier 1 common that we\u2019d see more than a 30% total payout ratio? And if yes, would you favor special dividends or share repurchase maybe talk about priorities? Kelly King : Yes. So, if those conditions exist, which we fully expect them to, certainly we would expect to apply for more than 30% total payout, absolutely. And so again it\u2019s been very conservative. This year doesn\u2019t give anything away it just keeps it in the pot, makes it available for our subsequent decisions. So as always, we would like to use excess capital to grow organically, like to do acquisitions, do as many being as aggressive as reasonable dividends including the possibility of special dividends. But if none of those seem to be the right decision then buybacks moves out the list in terms of our thinking. But I will remind you that we think about the issue of buybacks more than just reducing our capital. We never go and do a bunch of buybacks that the price still has a bad decision for the shareholders. And so it\u2019s pretty complex decision as you know. But the order priority would be as I described and I think you could reasonably expect us to be more aggressive in some form of fashion as we head into \u201815. Kevin St. Pierre - Sanford Bernstein :  Great, thank you. And a quick one for Daryl and/or Clarke, you mentioned in your comments Daryl that for the next few quarters, your quote was next few quarters you expect charge-offs to be below 50 to 70 basis point normal range. Is that because you\u2019re hesitant to forecast beyond the next few quarters or do you -- or is your expectation that net charge-offs will rise in 2015? Clarke Starnes : Kevin, this is Clarke, great question. There is nothing to imply that we necessarily think, there will be a big change. But as we said before, our normalized range based upon the way we\u2019re trying to grow the portfolio and deposit mix what we\u2019ve chosen for our company that that [\u201815] would probably through this cycle long-term sustainable (inaudible) certainly if the economy stays strong and as we\u2019re rebuilding early coming out of the older stuff running off then we could be below that range. So we\u2019re just I think being cautious and conservative. Kevin St. Pierre - Sanford Bernstein :  Great, thank you very much. Kelly King :  Sure. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Christopher Marinac of FIG Partners. Christopher Marinac - FIG Partners : Thanks. Daryl, you mentioned earlier about the need to grow core deposits, so I was curious if you expect any change even if it\u2019s [deferred] models than the overall funding costs of those few quarters? Daryl Bible : Yes, Christopher, what I would tell you is that we\u2019re pretty much at the floor on deposit costs. I would maybe forecast maybe a couple of more basis points coming down and that's really coming down in the CD book. I think if you look kind at how we're pricing our now accounts and our MMDA accounts. We're offering very attractive rates and we're getting a lot of good traction in growing both retail and corporate balances in those areas. And I think that\u2019s gained momentum in the community bank area and our large corporate area and I think that's going to play out throughout the year. Christopher Marinac - FIG Partners : Okay, great. And then Kelly just a follow-up for you, you mentioned about loan growth and kind of increased activity across the footprint. Is there a difference between their larger metro areas and the smaller more midsized markets? Kelly King : Yes, I would say there is. In two regards, one is in some cases some of the largest metro areas they got to being down the most have a bigger ramp up possibility because of that part being down. And then just a nature of large urban markets is they have more large businesses. And to be honest, the largest businesses in my market and I\u2019m pleased across the country are doing much better today than the small medium-sized businesses are largely because they have international opportunities and they have bigger scale. And so just a mathematical nature of that means there would be more lending opportunities in the larger markets, [let\u2019s] not to say that smaller markets are bad, it's just they are not growing today as fast because they don't have the large international components flowing through these large businesses. On the other hand, I will remind you that one of the reasons we like large and smaller markets, all these markets might not grow as fast in the rising time they don't go down as fast. And so it\u2019s now a really good part of our diversification strategy and we like them both. Christopher Marinac - FIG Partners : Great, thanks very much guys. Kelly King : Yes. Operator : We'll go to Nancy Bush, NAB Research LLC. Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC: Hi Kelly, how are you? Kelly King : Hey Nancy. Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC: Just a quick question sort of an add-on there, your optimism about business conditions I think is very well received but I am just sort of wondering about are you seeing a kind of resurgence across the Southeast or is it very spotty or if you could just comment on how the Southeast seems to be proceeding, I would appreciate it. Kelly King : Nancy, you have been the best around in terms of really focusing on the markets, specifically the Southeast. I would say, it\u2019s generally broad based. And as I travel around to the Florida or Texas or South Carolina where I have been recently, there is a broad based kind of generic change in mood. And so I think that is not market specific. I think frankly, you and I have talked about how the Southeast is going through a long-term kind of secular change in the nature of Southeast vis-\u00e0-vis Northeast. I think the Southeast in general is getting ready to have 10 to 20 years of relatively positive robust improvement, mainly because of something I think most people have focused on, and that is the change in currency value of the retirees wanting to move to Northeast to Southeast. So for 25 plus years, they were facing currency devaluation as the Southeast was growing fast and that market was not growing at all, so they could every year, they could sell their house and buy latest house because the currency went down. That\u2019s exactly flipped, we did a 50% discount on the Southeast and their values haven\u2019t gone down as much. So I think you are going to see some upward push particularly in real estate and related service in places like Florida. The market slot was fighting for a while and they have gaining again, Texas growing 1,000 people a day and so I think it\u2019s across the board and it\u2019s relatively positive. Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC: Just as an add-on to that, I mean could you speak to sort of the residential picture, residential construction picture in the Southeast? I mean what are we going to see in this next cycle? Daryl Bible : I think in the short run Nancy what you\u2019re going to see is kind of interesting is you\u2019re going to see some ramp up in prices and existing homes because we\u2019re going to go through a [valley] here of construction because of no lots available. We\u2019ve been through 5 years where we didn\u2019t develop any lots and it takes in many cases 18 months or so to get zoning and all to get the new lots going. So what you\u2019re seeing today is more of the large national builders are moving into bay, the lots are already developed so that they can -- they have the capital and they just have to get the lots. So, you\u2019re going to see upward prices on existing lots, upward prices on existing homes relative to their phenomenon. But simultaneously you will see A&D building because there is a dearth of lots out there. So I think hopefully won\u2019t be as robust as it was in the last 10 years or so before the crisis. But I think you get ready to see a solid development of momentum in A&D and verticals in the single family. And multifamily is still strong. I think it stays strong for next year or so. And then I think as the economics single versus rental costs, you\u2019ll see multifamily plateau. And so we\u2019ll be -- we\u2019re making that shift now, we\u2019re already focusing more on single family A&D and construction to be ready for that intending change. Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC: Thank you very much. Daryl Bible : You bet. Operator : And our final question comes from Gaston Ceron of Morningstar Equity Research. Gaston Ceron - Morningstar Equity Research : Hi, good morning. Kelly King : Good morning. Gaston Ceron - Morningstar Equity Research : Just very quick question going back to the M&A topic it sounds like perhaps not a lot on the firm burner in the near term but certainly still lots of interest on the long term. I am curious as you kind of assess your experience with the Citi branch acquisition; I\u2019m curious how that has kind of affected your appetite or interest in acquisition, future branch acquisitions of this kind versus in prior banks. I mean do you -- has your experience been so positive that you continue to see this as a kind of way to go out to franchise in key states? Kelly King : Yes. I think you are going to see likely more of -- you are seeing more, you will see a continuing trend of branch sell out fast, some of the largest institutions that are having capital issues and/or trying to narrow the product lines and/or market focuses, just like our opportunity coming out of Citi\u2019s decision in Texas is a really good opportunity. Now, it depends on the institution, it depends on the nature of their branch distribution, have they run it in a way this relationship oriented or they\u2019re just trying to push product, not so much the nature of the buildings and the technology but nature of the strategies in the marketplace, like for example the Bank Atlantic acquisition process is really good because while they have some problems on top of the house, they have a really good basic of retail strategy that we\u2019re able to build on. So Texas right now for us that looks very, very good. And I think that will be very good as we go through. If we see other situations like that, we would be very aggressive in looking at it. Certainly one of the advantage of branch acquisition is it eliminates any whole bank risk issues around BSA, AML et cetera. So it\u2019s -- it would be how on our list but not necessarily to the exclusion of whole banks. Gaston Ceron - Morningstar Equity Research : Great. Thanks for the color. Kelly King : You bet. Operator : I\u2019ll turn the conference back to Mr. Greer for any additional remarks. Alan Greer : Thank you, Felicia. And thanks to all of you for joining us. This concludes our call. Thank you and have a good day. Operator : That does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation.",

Good morning, everybody, and thanks for your interest in BB&T and thanks for joining our call. Unfortunately we had a couple of late quarter events which created some noise which I'll discuss with you and I think you'll see they're pretty straight forward non-recurring. But beyond that it really was a very solid quarter with strong performance in virtually all of our strategic initiatives. If you look at slide three you'll see net income total $425 million versus $547 million last second quarter mostly diluted because of these unusual items. Diluted EPS of $0.58 compared to $0.77. These unusual items with earnings was reduced by $0.12 due to mortgage and tax related reserve adjustments and a $0.01 due to merger related restructuring charges. So, if you adjust for these unusual items, our core EPS would be $0.71. And our adjusted ROA was (1.24) [ph] adjusted ROE was (9.84) [ph] and our adjusted return on tangible common equity was a strong (15.52) [ph]. So, while we're not where we expect to be once we get through these short term process changes we've been talking to you about we're really very pleased with our core business performance. Total revenues were up 3% to 2.3 billion compared to the first quarter, revenues were up due to high mortgage income, investment banking, service charges on deposits performed very well. Also had strong loan growth and improved fee income. Our fee income ratio was a strong 44% versus 43.2% in the first quarter. I was really very pleased with overall loan growth which I consider to be robust given the market conditions, which you know we had a very soft first quarter due mainly to weather. And we started the second quarter, expecting 3% to 5% which was our guidance but we updated mid-cycle that we thought we would exceed that and momentum continued to build through the quarter, so in fact we ended up with 7.8% ex-covered which was very strong.  We made some tactical changes on our community bank which really accelerated production and banks have been really, really pleased with that. All of our strategic initiatives experienced strong loan production including corporate banking, wealth lending, all of our specialized lending businesses; of course, we did have some strong seasonal growth in some businesses like [indiscernible] CAFO and our Texas loan production is really very-very strong.  Overall the pilot production continued to be very strong. We're really getting excellent growth from our newer markets of our community bank and our national corporate banking strategy is producing excellent results in deposits. Almost all of our credit metrics continue to improve and I was very pleased to see charge-offs down to 40 basis points substantially under our long-term guidance of 50 to 70, lower since 2007.  Our NPA has decreased another 7.1%. I would point out though that while we may see a bit more of the cloud, we probably have kind of a base floor or normal level of NPAs. Now when you kind of get down to the bottom, you have a certain amount of natural flow. So I don't consider NPA to be a storyline at this point. They just tell you, it's kind of be what they're going to be in the normal operations as we go forward. If you look at expenses, our increase in non-interest expense is driven primarily by 118 million housing reserves related to FHA insured loans, I'll talk about. And an increase of 27 million of personnel expenses, mostly due to the fact we had stronger production related incentives. If you exclude the unusual items and production expenses, expenses were relatively flat as we indicated they would be in our mid-quarter update at a conference.  So we're really focused on the expenses we understand that on a relatively slow economy which we still have and tight margin pressures. Expenses is something that you can't control, we get that and we're really-really focused on it. We still expect our efficiency ratio to be in the 56% range in the fourth quarter. I recognize that is a substantial drop in the 59% that we've put this through in enormous amount of scrutiny and I am very confident. I can't guarantee it, but I'm very confident that we're going to be able to give that. We put a number of measures in place to ensure that we do. If you look at slide 4, I want to talk to you a little bit about these unusual items. Well said, later in the quarter we had these couple of events. We were notified that FHA insured loan origination process will be the subject of an audit survey by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. There are no findings from HUD at this time. In fact we don't even have an audit; we just have a notice of an audit survey. But in light of announcements made by other financial institutions related to the outcomes of similar audits and related matters, and after further review of our exposure, we believe it's prudent to have for us to establish the reserves.  It's been an industry issue as you know for many FHA originators, and we believe this is just the appropriate conservative course of action for our company. We established the reserve, 53 million which was 85 million pre-tax but affects other expenses and 21 million which is 33 million pre-tax to adjust our indemnification reserve for issues going forward. It's going to be likely several quarters before this will be resolved and it could be a year and a half or so before we find out what the final determination is.  In addition the RS changed the position that they held for almost a year and are now indicated we need an addition of $14 million also to return our tax reserves to fully reserved position. We also had $8 million in after-tax merger related restructuring charges, which is about $0.01 a share so I sort out the noise, you know we live in a dynamic world that I think you can see these are really unusual and non-recurring items.  If you flip with me to slide 5, I'll talk a little bit about lending. To understand we have robust loan growth. As basically given the current markets conditions, which are pretty challenging out there, and our conservative and discipline and credit culture, so the growth was robust. It was really broad-based. As you can see from the slide, C&I was up 10%, CRE income produced some 3.5%, CRE construction development was 18.3%. So if you combine that total commercial was at 9.1% which is really very-very pleasing.  Direct retail recall is kind of messy between that mortgage because we transferred out several billion dollars last part of the first quarter from retail to mortgage under the QM restructuring. So if you adjust for that direct retail was up really a very strong 8%. I am very; very pleased about sales finance was up a very strong in similar season was 25%. Residential mortgage again chose up 23%, but again if you adjust for what we transferred in, it's about flat by design because we are now selling most of our production. Other lending subsidiaries were up 12.4% that has strong seasonal growth from Sheffield of 26% and Grandbridge up 30%. So if you look at the C&I, CRE construction and income, in C&I area that was really mostly driven by large corporate lending, mortgage warehouse. I'll point out that, that market is extremely tight, spreads are really tight. It's more competitive than any of us have ever seen in our careers. So it's a real tight rope in terms of managing the right level of growth, in terms of quality and spreads. We're simply not going to equivocate with regard to quality and so we maintained a with disciplined position with regard to leverage lending, really large hold positions and so given that context, we feel really good about the growth we're getting. Really pleased that our CRE activities have changed, this is a sea change from the last several years where both of those portfolios were really running off. We're still very disciplined of the quality, but fact is those markets are coming back and a lot of the run-off has already occurred, so really good momentum there which should continue. The direct retail is really strong, we're getting great growth in our community bank, our wealth production is really strong. The community bank is just kind of a miraculous change to be honest. Rick and his team made some important tactical changes. Frankly, adjusting our pricing a bit to get little closer to the market. We've gone over the market frankly and we kind of got a little closer to the market, we've got more sort of focus, we've got through the QM restructuring which kind of took our eyes off the bottle a little bit and that all that is kind of behind it. So 8% growth in retail is really good. We think that has legs as we go forward. Sales finance just continues to rock along, we have a great sales finance program. I know there is some concern out in the marketplace in terms of quality; our quality metrics are extremely good kind of past use and ours is at all-time lows. So we feel really good about that, really tightly focused on beacon scores et cetera. Residential mortgage, as I said is kind of flattish. We expected to stay kind of flattish; we're selling all of our production except jumbos. We'll continue to keep our jumbos, because that's really high quality, well clients, mostly -- and but mostly you can expect to see our residential portfolio kind of flattish. Our other lending subsidiaries will continue to do well in all of the areas that we're focused on there.  So looking forward to the second half, we expect a range of 3% to 5%, could be a little stronger in the third as the strong momentum in the second carries over, the first followed the third but conservatively obviously 3% to 5% for the whole second half, we'll still have strong growth in C&I, CRE income and construction, other lending subsidiaries, particularly sales finance will be strong, retail lending will potentially be strong, will get strong growth in premium finance, Grandbridge and Sheffield. So we're really blessed to have such a good diversification in our lending strategies. So we're not wholly dependent on any one particular strategy and we continue to be focused on doing a lot of things well rather than being solely dependent on any one particular strategy. If you flip quickly to slide six, just a comment with regard to audit. So our total deposit diversification and liquidity strategies continue to be executed really well. So we had improved deposit mix and cost, cost coming down another $0.01, now I will tell you that that cost is getting kind of to a base level, so it's not likely to continue but it is at a low level, that might well continue for a while. Non-interest bearing deposits or DDA was up 14.1%. Total deposits were up 12.4%, really good growth in pro-forma business non-interest bearing deposits which increased respectively 18% and 19.6% annualized versus the first quarter, so feel really good about that. Very pleased that our DDA mix is up to 28.3% versus 25.8% in the second quarter of '13. [Indiscernible] couple of years ago there was about 15%. So it's really, really changed pretty dramatically. Recall that for the last several years, we've been focused on diversification strategies in our asset mix and our liability mix and we are just relentlessly chasing those strategies and they are working very, very well. Really pleased about the addition of $1.2 billion in deposits and a number of branches in Texas. We continue to feel great about the Texas market. Of course we added 30 de novo branches there last year and all of that together is really moving the needle for us in the Texas market where we are now a top 20 bank in Texas. Still a long way from top five we'd like to be in all the markets we serve but we are on the way and we believe we will get there. So, let me turn it to Daryl now for some more color and detail on some of the various categories. Daryl? King: Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for your interest in BB&T and thanks for joining our call. Unfortunately we had a couple of late quarter events which created some noise which I'll discuss with you and I think you'll see they're pretty straight forward non-recurring. But beyond that it really was a very solid quarter with strong performance in virtually all of our strategic initiatives. If you look at slide three you'll see net income total $425 million versus $547 million last second quarter mostly diluted because of these unusual items. Diluted EPS of $0.58 compared to $0.77. These unusual items with earnings was reduced by $0.12 due to mortgage and tax related reserve adjustments and a $0.01 due to merger related restructuring charges. So, if you adjust for these unusual items, our core EPS would be $0.71. And our adjusted ROA was (1.24) [ph] adjusted ROE was (9.84) [ph] and our adjusted return on tangible common equity was a strong (15.52) [ph]. So, while we're not where we expect to be once we get through these short term process changes we've been talking to you about we're really very pleased with our core business performance. Total revenues were up 3% to 2.3 billion compared to the first quarter, revenues were up due to high mortgage income, investment banking, service charges on deposits performed very well. Also had strong loan growth and improved fee income. Our fee income ratio was a strong 44% versus 43.2% in the first quarter. I was really very pleased with overall loan growth which I consider to be robust given the market conditions, which you know we had a very soft first quarter due mainly to weather. And we started the second quarter, expecting 3% to 5% which was our guidance but we updated mid-cycle that we thought we would exceed that and momentum continued to build through the quarter, so in fact we ended up with 7.8% ex-covered which was very strong. We made some tactical changes on our community bank which really accelerated production and banks have been really, really pleased with that. All of our strategic initiatives experienced strong loan production including corporate banking, wealth lending, all of our specialized lending businesses; of course, we did have some strong seasonal growth in some businesses like [indiscernible] CAFO and our Texas loan production is really very-very strong.  Overall the pilot production continued to be very strong. We're really getting excellent growth from our newer markets of our community bank and our national corporate banking strategy is producing excellent results in deposits. Almost all of our credit metrics continue to improve and I was very pleased to see charge-offs down to 40 basis points substantially under our long-term guidance of 50 to 70, lower since 2007. Our NPA has decreased another 7.1%. I would point out though that while we may see a bit more of the cloud, we probably have kind of a base floor or normal level of NPAs. Now when you kind of get down to the bottom, you have a certain amount of natural flow. So I don't consider NPA to be a storyline at this point. They just tell you, it's kind of be what they're going to be in the normal operations as we go forward. If you look at expenses, our increase in non-interest expense is driven primarily by 118 million housing reserves related to FHA insured loans, I'll talk about. And an increase of 27 million of personnel expenses, mostly due to the fact we had stronger production related incentives. If you exclude the unusual items and production expenses, expenses were relatively flat as we indicated they would be in our mid-quarter update at a conference.  So we're really focused on the expenses we understand that on a relatively slow economy which we still have and tight margin pressures. Expenses is something that you can't control, we get that and we're really-really focused on it. We still expect our efficiency ratio to be in the 56% range in the fourth quarter. I recognize that is a substantial drop in the 59% that we've put this through in enormous amount of scrutiny and I am very confident. I can't guarantee it, but I'm very confident that we're going to be able to give that. We put a number of measures in place to ensure that we do.  If you look at slide 4, I want to talk to you a little bit about these unusual items. Well said, later in the quarter we had these couple of events.

Still a long way from top five we'd like to be in all the markets we serve but we are on the way and we believe we will get there. So, let me turn it to Daryl now for some more color and detail on some of the various categories. Daryl? Daryl: Thank you, Kelly and good morning everyone. I am going to talk about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, non-interest expense, capital and our segment results.  Continuing on slide seven, we continue to see improvement in credit quality. Second quarter net charge-offs excluding cover declined 25% to 117 million or 40 basis points versus 55 basis points and down 12% compared to last quarter. We continue to expect net charge-offs to remain below our normalized long-term charge-off guidance of 50 to 70 basis points for the next few quarters, assuming no material decline in the economy. 30 to 89 day past dues increased 84 million compared to last quarter, due to seasonal increases in our specialized lending businesses. In most other categories 30 to 89 days past due decreased as credit continues to perform very well. The 12.9% decrease in 90 day past dues was driven primarily by a reduction in delinquencies on government guaranteed residential mortgages. NPAs excluding covered declined 7.1% with a 12.7% decrease in commercial NPLs. NPAs as a percentage of total assets are at their lowest levels since 2007 at 49 basis points. We expect NPAs to improve at a modest pace in the third quarter. Turning to slide eight, our allowance coverage remains very strong. The coverage for non-performing loans increased to 1.78 times from 1.7 times last quarter. We had a reserve release of 39 million excluding covered activity and the change with the reserve for unfunded commitments. This compares to an 80 million relief last quarter excluding the same items. We do not expect further reserve releases in future quarters. Continuing on slide nine, margin came in at 3.43%, down 9 basis points from the first quarter and in-line with our guidance. Core margin was 3.22%. The decline was the result of lower earning asset yields and the impact of our covered asset portfolio. Partially offset by improved funding cost, asset mix changes and wider credit spreads.  Looking at the next quarter, we expect margin to decline another 5 to 10 basis points for similar reasons. Net interest income will be relatively flat for the third quarter, including the impact of purchase accounting. Looking at the graph, at the bottom of the slide, our asset sensitivity improved from the end of the first quarter, mainly from asset and funding mix changes. Turning to slide 10, our fee income ratio improved to 44% compared to 43.2% last quarter. Overall, non-interest income increased 22 million compared to last quarter. This was driven mainly by increases in mortgage banking, bankcard fees and merchant discounts, checkcard fees and service charges on deposits. Mortgage banking income increased 12 million, mostly from a 24% increase in production income and an increase in gain on sale, mainly driven by retail spreads. Bankcard fees and merchant discounts, service charges on deposits and checkcard fees all increased due to higher volumes.  Insurance income decreased slightly compared to the first quarter, mainly due to lower employee benefit commissions and lower performance based incentives, partially offset by increased P&C commissions.  Overall, we expect non-interest income to be almost flat next quarter, driven by a 50 million seasonal decline in insurance income, partially offset by other fee items.  Turning to Slide 11, the efficiency ratio for the quarter was up slightly compared to the first quarter at 59.8%. Total non-interest expense increased to 148 million compared to last quarter, which includes mostly unusual items. The increase was driven by 118 million in mortgage related charges. Other expenses includes 85 million related to FHA loans and loan related expense includes 33 million related to an increase in repurchase reserves. The increase in personnel expense was driven mostly by higher insurance and mortgage production related incentives, and seasonally higher equity based compensation for retirement eligible employees. In spite of the 140 FTEs added in Texas, FTEs declined 350 compared to last quarter. As we continue to right size our businesses we expect further FTE reductions over the next two quarters. Merger related and restructuring charges totaled 13 million due to severance accruals and the conversion of 21 Texas branches that occurred late in the second quarter. Going forward we expect expenses to fall below 1.4 billion in both third and fourth quarters. As a result of the declines in lower FTEs, incentives and regulatory and discretionary cost in the second half of the year. We continued to target an efficiency ratio in the 56% range in the fourth quarter. Finally our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.6%, we're expecting a slightly higher rate in the third quarter. Turning to Slide 12; capital ratios continued to remain strong, tier 1 common at 10.2% and tier 1 at 12%. Tier 1 declined slightly from the increase in loans and loan commitments resulting from higher risk weighted assets. Also our estimated common equity tier 1 ratio was approximately 10% at the end of the second quarter unchanged from last quarter. Looking at liquidity we continue to make excellent progress in the LCR ratio, which is currently 93% compared to 87 in the first quarter. If you recall 80% is what is required by the first of next year as currently proposed.  Beginning in Slide 13, loan demand increased significantly versus last quarter in the community bank with strong production in C&I and dealer floor plan up 15% and CRE up 31% and direct retail up 62%. Community bank also experienced strong growth in CRE and dealer floor plan growth as well as nice increases in dealer and direct retail lending. Net income totaled 222 million up both linked and like quarters. Our optimization efforts in this area continued to result in significant cost savings. Finally successful conversion of the 21 branches in Texas added 1.2 billion in deposits. Turning to Slide 14, residential mortgage, net income declined mostly due to FHA charges. The mix to refi the purchase was 29% to 71%. Originations were up 24% versus last quarter to 4.7 billion and we expect to be relatively consistent next quarter. Looking at dealer financial services on Slide 15, net income was up significantly in the quarter at 63 million as dealer financial services continue to generate strong loan production. Originations from prime auto business were up close to 30% compared to last quarter. Non-prime originations were up 32% versus linked quarter. Growth in both of these businesses was driven by increases in auto sales as well as increased marketing efforts to the dealers. Underlying asset quality continues to perform very well and our end of period NPAs decreased 17% compared to last quarter. Quality continues to be pristine with charge-offs in the prime auto portfolio at nine basis points this quarter. Finally our operating margin in this segment was up linked quarter and was 79.2% at the end of the second quarter. Turning to Slide 16, our specialized lending segment had experienced an outstanding quarter earning net income of 60 million. Loan growth for Grandbridge was 31% and Sheffield was 26% compared to last quarter. Increased growth in Grandbridge was partially due to the portfolio of product introduced this year, while Sheffield growth was seasonally strong. We expect to achieve double digit loan growth in this segment next quarter. Moving to slide 17, BB&T Insurance net income was 58 million in the second quarter driven by strong and new renewal business. Non-interest income declined due to seasonality employee benefit commissions and lower performance based commissions, which was partially offset by strong new business and solid client retention. We had good production in both retail and wholesale businesses. Same-store sales was strong at approximately 6% and the EBITDA margin declined 24% due to lower performance commissions this quarter. Turning to slide 18, our financial services segment generated 68 million in net income drive by a loan growth in corporate banking at 38% and 41% while as compared to last quarter. The invested assets increased to 117 billion to up 10% compared to last quarter. This will continue to drive strong revenues for us in the future. In closing, we see additional modest credit improvement relatively stable revenue and a decline in non-interest expenses and moderate loan growth in the next quarter.  And with that let me turn it back over to Kelly for closing remarks and Q&A. Bible: Thank you, Kelly and good morning everyone. I am going to talk about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, non-interest expense, capital and our segment results.  Continuing on slide seven, we continue to see improvement in credit quality. Second quarter net charge-offs excluding cover declined 25% to 117 million or 40 basis points versus 55 basis points and down 12% compared to last quarter. We continue to expect net charge-offs to remain below our normalized long-term charge-off guidance of 50 to 70 basis points for the next few quarters, assuming no material decline in the economy. 30 to 89 day past dues increased 84 million compared to last quarter, due to seasonal increases in our specialized lending businesses.

Finally our operating margin in this segment was up linked quarter and was 79.2% at the end of the second quarter. Turning to Slide 16, our specialized lending segment had experienced an outstanding quarter earning net income of 60 million. Loan growth for Grandbridge was 31% and Sheffield was 26% compared to last quarter. Increased growth in Grandbridge was partially due to the portfolio of product introduced this year, while Sheffield growth was seasonally strong. We expect to achieve double digit loan growth in this segment next quarter. Moving to slide 17, BB&T Insurance net income was 58 million in the second quarter driven by strong and new renewal business. Non-interest income declined due to seasonality employee benefit commissions and lower performance based commissions, which was partially offset by strong new business and solid client retention. We had good production in both retail and wholesale businesses. Same-store sales was strong at approximately 6% and the EBITDA margin declined 24% due to lower performance commissions this quarter. Turning to slide 18, our financial services segment generated 68 million in net income drive by a loan growth in corporate banking at 38% and 41% while as compared to last quarter. The invested assets increased to 117 billion to up 10% compared to last quarter. This will continue to drive strong revenues for us in the future. In closing, we see additional modest credit improvement relatively stable revenue and a decline in non-interest expenses and moderate loan growth in the next quarter.  And with that let me turn it back over to Kelly for closing remarks and Q&A. Kelly: Thank you, Daryl. So I think you can see ex the unusual items really very solid quarter. We have strong loan in deposit growth, we had improving fee income ratio. Our expenses adjusted were flat we expect them to be down to 6% by the fourth quarter. And really all of our strategic initiatives are working extremely well. So it's a challenging world, it's a challenging market but we continue to focus on our long term strategies and we absolutely believe our best days are ahead. So, Alan, I'll turn it to you for Q&A. King: Thank you, Daryl. So I think you can see ex the unusual items really very solid quarter. We have strong loan in deposit growth, we had improving fee income ratio.

Alan: Okay. Thank you, Kelly. We'll now enter a time for our Q&A session. Please follow our normal practice of asking a primary question and one follow up so that we can maximize participation in the call. Thank you. Adam if you will come on now and explain the process for Q&A. Greer: Okay. Thank you, Kelly. We'll now enter a time for our Q&A session. Please follow our normal practice of asking a primary question and one follow up so that we can maximize participation in the call. Thank you. Adam if you will come on now and explain the process for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we'll take our first question from Gerard Cassidy, RBC. Gerard: Daryl, can you or Kelly can you share with us you guys had some good strong commercial real estate loan growth and you mentioned it was in construction as well. What type of construction lending you're having success that at this time? Cassidy: Daryl, can you or Kelly can you share with us you guys had some good strong commercial real estate loan growth and you mentioned it was in construction as well. What type of construction lending you're having success that at this time? RBC: Daryl, can you or Kelly can you share with us you guys had some good strong commercial real estate loan growth and you mentioned it was in construction as well. What type of construction lending you're having success that at this time? Kelly: Gerard it's getting to be broad based but it's mostly - we're still, in the income side we'll still see apartments and again beginning to see a little bit of activity and hotels but mostly in apartments and income side, in the retail side it's basically vertical so we're finally seeing activity in terms of builders coming back in for a call down of lines for development of lots, there's a dearth of lots out there now which we kind of projected was coming in and that's happening so we're seeing lot developments. And pure construction lending by some of our local strong builders that survive the crisis not that many did, but once it is survive a very strong and so it's fairly broad based, for all I say and frankly I think it's got legs for a good while to go. King: Gerard it's getting to be broad based but it's mostly - we're still, in the income side we'll still see apartments and again beginning to see a little bit of activity and hotels but mostly in apartments and income side, in the retail side it's basically vertical so we're finally seeing activity in terms of builders coming back in for a call down of lines for development of lots, there's a dearth of lots out there now which we kind of projected was coming in and that's happening so we're seeing lot developments.

Gerard: Kelly, is it also geographically disbursed or is it more down in Florida in the South East or the Carolinas? Cassidy: Kelly, is it also geographically disbursed or is it more down in Florida in the South East or the Carolinas? RBC: Kelly, is it also geographically disbursed or is it more down in Florida in the South East or the Carolinas? Kelly: Well, we'll seeing it into Carolinas pretty growth strong from places like The Triangle Atlanta, DC, Gulf Coast, South Florida, so it's fairly broad based and of course we're saying we're newly entered in Texas but we're beginning to get some traction even in Texas in this business. Of course construction in Texas is booming or adding 1,000 people a day. So it's moving. King: Well, we'll seeing it into Carolinas pretty growth strong from places like The Triangle Atlanta, DC, Gulf Coast, South Florida, so it's fairly broad based and of course we're saying we're newly entered in Texas but we're beginning to get some traction even in Texas in this business. Of course construction in Texas is booming or adding 1,000 people a day. So it's moving. Gerard: Thank you. And then finally the second question is your capital obviously is very strong, your Tier 1 common ratio was well above the required minimums where you guys maybe as we finally get through this regulatory process and everybody is very comfortable with the CCAR, what's your comfort level of where the tier one common ratio should sit? Cassidy: Thank you. And then finally the second question is your capital obviously is very strong, your Tier 1 common ratio was well above the required minimums where you guys maybe as we finally get through this regulatory process and everybody is very comfortable with the CCAR, what's your comfort level of where the tier one common ratio should sit? RBC: Thank you. And then finally the second question is your capital obviously is very strong, your Tier 1 common ratio was well above the required minimums where you guys maybe as we finally get through this regulatory process and everybody is very comfortable with the CCAR, what's your comfort level of where the tier one common ratio should sit? Kelly King : Well I think you know we are all still -- at least we are still trying to be fairly conservative you know in the absolute levels. So we will keep more of a cushion than we would otherwise but clearly we are above where we need to be. And so as we continue to accrete capital we clearly have, we have building capacity for return of capital as we head into '15 and you know whether that will take the form of strong organic growth M&A or how our dividends and our shareholder purchase, because all of that will probably be some kind of a mix to be honest of all evidence as we head into '15 but I think you can expect substantially higher shareholder return of capital in '15 versus '14. Operator : And we will take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning guys it's actually Brian from Ken Steen. I wanted to just start on the efficiency ratio. So, as Kelly said you know quite a bit of work to do to get from the 59.8 in the second quarter down to 56% by the fourth quarter, you know the guide for the third quarter looks like revenues are expected to go flattish on quarter-over-quarter. So just wanted to get your thoughts about how you are thinking about the mix of revenue growth in the back half of the year to get to that 56% versus the expense reductions? Kelly King : You know most of it will be driven on the new motor side, we clearly have a number of strategies in place that will kick in in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter of business strategies in terms of reconstructualizing our businesses that are frankly already done and they will be rolling out in terms of how you take reserves and then the actual plans go in to affect but all of that is well conceived already executed so its thus far we have a large degree of certainty about that and as we may have indicated you know a good bit of the process cost are beginning to pay down as we head through the late third quarter and into fourth quarter. So, it's not a perfect world and you should have some unusual items to go against this but we describe this really carefully because obviously we said this in the beginning, we said mid quarter that we will be flattish for the second which is what happened. So, I understand that's a big leap from 59 point down to 56 point but we feel very confident that, that's what's going to happen and you will have to challenge us so long as we go through the third and fourth but we stand on it. Unidentified: Okay, and on the manager's margin you expect another five to 10 basis points of pressure in the third quarter mainly due to covered asset roll-off but what are your expectations for the (core nimb) [ph] and should we start to see it stabilize here in the back half of the year? Analyst: Okay, and on the manager's margin you expect another five to 10 basis points of pressure in the third quarter mainly due to covered asset roll-off but what are your expectations for the (core nimb) [ph] and should we start to see it stabilize here in the back half of the year? Daryl: Yeah Brian, this is Daryl. What I would tell you is that our core margin should start to stabilize over the next couple of quarters. I would expect -- if we're down five to 10 this next quarter we're probably down three to four probably over the next couple of quarters in core margin. Soabout half or little bit less than half of what the GAAP margins coming down. Bible: Yeah Brian, this is Daryl. What I would tell you is that our core margin should start to stabilize over the next couple of quarters. I would expect -- if we're down five to 10 this next quarter we're probably down three to four probably over the next couple of quarters in core margin. Soabout half or little bit less than half of what the GAAP margins coming down. Operator : And we will take our next question from John Pancari with Evercore. John: I wonder if you give us a little bit more detail on the decline in the securities balances in the quarter and if you could remind us a little bit more about what you are still doing in the securities books and positioning for LCR in terms of what you are buying and what yields? Thanks. Pancari : I wonder if you give us a little bit more detail on the decline in the securities balances in the quarter and if you could remind us a little bit more about what you are still doing in the securities books and positioning for LCR in terms of what you are buying and what yields? Thanks. Evercore: I wonder if you give us a little bit more detail on the decline in the securities balances in the quarter and if you could remind us a little bit more about what you are still doing in the securities books and positioning for LCR in terms of what you are buying and what yields? Thanks. Daryl: Yes, so our security balances, if you look on an average basis were really pretty flat were around 40 billion, as far as the LCR ratio goes, we continue to make great progress, we're at 93%, we'll probably end the year around the 100% if the rules don't change, we get any relief from the final rolls that come out our LCR ratio will be significantly above 100% which actually could be used as an advantage are going forward potentially. As far as the type of securities we're purchasing, as we get cash flow in, we are buying tier 1 securities of mainly Jenny Mays and U.S. Treasuries. Our duration in the portfolio is a little bit over four years but our new purchases are shorter and that's what we're trying to average down a little bit. Bible: Yes, so our security balances, if you look on an average basis were really pretty flat were around 40 billion, as far as the LCR ratio goes, we continue to make great progress, we're at 93%, we'll probably end the year around the 100% if the rules don't change, we get any relief from the final rolls that come out our LCR ratio will be significantly above 100% which actually could be used as an advantage are going forward potentially.

Our duration in the portfolio is a little bit over four years but our new purchases are shorter and that's what we're trying to average down a little bit. John: Okay, all right. And then secondly on the loan growth, just want to see if you can give us a little bit more color on the strength in the C&I. I know you gave some good color on CRE and a little bit of a color on the C&I drivers on the call but just want to get some additional detail on what you're really seeing in terms of the pickup in C&I, because it definitely came in stronger than expected. Pancari : Okay, all right. And then secondly on the loan growth, just want to see if you can give us a little bit more color on the strength in the C&I. I know you gave some good color on CRE and a little bit of a color on the C&I drivers on the call but just want to get some additional detail on what you're really seeing in terms of the pickup in C&I, because it definitely came in stronger than expected. Evercore: Okay, all right. And then secondly on the loan growth, just want to see if you can give us a little bit more color on the strength in the C&I. I know you gave some good color on CRE and a little bit of a color on the C&I drivers on the call but just want to get some additional detail on what you're really seeing in terms of the pickup in C&I, because it definitely came in stronger than expected. Kelly: So primarily right now the C&I growth is coming out of our national corporate banking strategy, it's very broad base in terms of our various industry verticals, we are getting good growth in our energy space but also food and agriculture and other verticals. Recall that we initiated strategies several years ago, we see have a very small share of the national corporate banking market. I would point out that it's still a very granular portfolio with average deal size about $35 million, so we're not taking really big deals we're just getting a lot of number of shares of really good companies in those various verticals. We are getting good C&I growth in Texas in to community bank as well and so I would say that in the industry there is a bit of a bifurcation today that some people have not yet focus on and that main street America small business smaller into middle market is very, very tepid, it's still flattish and most of the growth in the country is coming from the large market, most of the calls they have international strategies and so we are glad that we are able to participate in that. Now when the small to middle size market risk begin to move which we hope will happen, then you'll see a really big kick coming out of our community bank but for the time being it's largely being driven out of our warehouse strategy and our large national corporate banking strategy.

Operator : We'll take our next question from Eric [indiscernible] SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Unidentified: Thanks very much. I'm afraid I'm just coming back to the efficiency ratio and to the operating expense figures. In that fourth quarter efficiency ratio target is there a component of the improvement that relates to seasonal expense or is that actually sort of a core run rate figure? Analyst: Thanks very much. I'm afraid I'm just coming back to the efficiency ratio and to the operating expense figures. In that fourth quarter efficiency ratio target is there a component of the improvement that relates to seasonal expense or is that actually sort of a core run rate figure? Kelly: No, that's kind of a core run rate, we don't see the seasonal impact on expenses in the fall, we see it a lot in the first and the second but, no it's core it's related to personnel expenses, it's related to project and process cost, consulting cost, all of those categories, but not lot frankly it's in personnel expenses. King: No, that's kind of a core run rate, we don't see the seasonal impact on expenses in the fall, we see it a lot in the first and the second but, no it's core it's related to personnel expenses, it's related to project and process cost, consulting cost, all of those categories, but not lot frankly it's in personnel expenses. Unidentified: From the FDE reductions? Analyst: From the FDE reductions? Kelly: Yes. King: Yes. Unidentified: And so I guess really my core question is really this, you're currently running at around a low 70 kind of core earnings number and the consensus estimates have you kind of coming out of this year at $0.80 and given the commentary on revenue it's sounds then like the entire incremental improvement is coming out of OpEx and I guess my question is, is that a forecast that you're comfortable with. Analyst: And so I guess really my core question is really this, you're currently running at around a low 70 kind of core earnings number and the consensus estimates have you kind of coming out of this year at $0.80 and given the commentary on revenue it's sounds then like the entire incremental improvement is coming out of OpEx and I guess my question is, is that a forecast that you're comfortable with. Kelly: Well I think we're comfortable with the expense forecast, we're comfortable with the loan guidance and we're comfortable with our margin, but to be honest, some of the consensus analysts have not factored in, the guidance we've given with regard to margin, I think people who have had challenges with regard to dealing with the covered and even though we've been really transparent including graphs, it's been difficult for people to factor that in. So I'm comfortable with what we projected and thank you if you do the math then you'll arrive at the right conclusion. King: Well I think we're comfortable with the expense forecast, we're comfortable with the loan guidance and we're comfortable with our margin, but to be honest, some of the consensus analysts have not factored in, the guidance we've given with regard to margin, I think people who have had challenges with regard to dealing with the covered and even though we've been really transparent including graphs, it's been difficult for people to factor that in. So I'm comfortable with what we projected and thank you if you do the math then you'll arrive at the right conclusion. Operator : We'll take our next question from Paul Miller, FBR. Unidentified: Good morning. This is actually [indiscernible] Paul. Can you just say what the line utilization's been in the quarter? We saw a couple of banks that had a pickup in utilization. Analyst: Good morning. This is actually [indiscernible] Paul. Can you just say what the line utilization's been in the quarter? We saw a couple of banks that had a pickup in utilization. Clarke: Yes, this is Clark Starnes. We actually had some nice improvement, our utilization was up 700 basis points up to about 39% have been running in the mid-30s, so it was as Kelly said higher utilizations and things like our energy portfolio, our REIT portfolio, mortgage warehouse and several of the initiatives that we already talked about. So we were quite encouraged about that, hope it will continue. Starnes: Yes, this is Clark Starnes. We actually had some nice improvement, our utilization was up 700 basis points up to about 39% have been running in the mid-30s, so it was as Kelly said higher utilizations and things like our energy portfolio, our REIT portfolio, mortgage warehouse and several of the initiatives that we already talked about. So we were quite encouraged about that, hope it will continue. Unidentified: And just a quick follow up. There was a pretty negative article on auto-lending in New York Times over the weekend. If that segment started getting sort of increased headline risk or regulatory scrutiny, would you guys change your behavior at all in that business? Are you comfortable with the risk you're taking? Analyst: And just a quick follow up. There was a pretty negative article on auto-lending in New York Times over the weekend. If that segment started getting sort of increased headline risk or regulatory scrutiny, would you guys change your behavior at all in that business? Are you comfortable with the risk you're taking? Kelly: I saw that article and I think it's probably true for a good bit of the industry. But it was talking primarily about really the lower end of the used car dealers and the lower end of the sub-prime lenders. We don't participate in that space. We're in sub-prime lending but not what they were talking about. In fact over the last several years we dramatically tightened down our lending standards and our processes. Our scoring, our credit big and scores et cetera continue to improve. I was reading through some commentary this weekend from our folks that run that business, a number of our credit metrics are like all-time lows for those businesses. So our business is doing great. Now to your point, if the market continues improve, deteriorate and become more frothy and if it bleeds over to the market in general, what you would see would be our volumes would go down because we'll just keep doing what we do, which is good solid quality conservative underwriting. And if others choose to do a more risky lending, they'll take volume that we won't take. So it will be a function of what others do, not what we do.

Operator : Then we'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck, Morgan Stanley. Betsy: Two follow up questions, one on expenses and one of the LCR. On the expenses, appreciate the color on where you're expecting the expanses to go in 3Q, 4Q, the 1.4 billion, sub 1.4. I am just wondering is that a good run rate as we think into '15 I know you're not talking about '15 specifically but is that kind of a normalized number from which we should build our '15 model? Graseck: Two follow up questions, one on expenses and one of the LCR. On the expenses, appreciate the color on where you're expecting the expanses to go in 3Q, 4Q, the 1.4 billion, sub 1.4.

Kelly: Betsy I know you've been around this business a long time as have I. And talking about 2015 at this point, you might as well ask me about 2020. I don't know what's going to happen in 2015. But I think conceptually to your point it's not inappropriate to think about that as kind of a base line. I mean there is nothing that we're doing in the third and fourth to bring expenses down. That's going to jump up right back up in the first and second. So I don't think that's inappropriate to think about it in that concept. But we're not ready to give any guidance with regard to next year. King: Betsy I know you've been around this business a long time as have I. And talking about 2015 at this point, you might as well ask me about 2020. I don't know what's going to happen in 2015.

But we're not ready to give any guidance with regard to next year. Betsy: And then on the LCR Daryl you mentioned that if certain decisions were made you'd be at 100% plus. Is that a 100% plus LCR or is this 100% of the 70% that you need to be at. Graseck: And then on the LCR Daryl you mentioned that if certain decisions were made you'd be at 100% plus. Is that a 100% plus LCR or is this 100% of the 70% that you need to be at. Morgan: And then on the LCR Daryl you mentioned that if certain decisions were made you'd be at 100% plus.

Is that a 100% plus LCR or is this 100% of the 70% that you need to be at. Daryl: No we would be 100% off the rules that are proposed today, we're at 93. So we're in a really strong position and if we get any relief from the final rules, our number will be low north of 100%. Bible: No we would be 100% off the rules that are proposed today, we're at 93. So we're in a really strong position and if we get any relief from the final rules, our number will be low north of 100%. Betsy: That's well above the ratio that you're required to have. Graseck: That's well above the ratio that you're required to have. Morgan: That's well above the ratio that you're required to have. Stanley: That's well above the ratio that you're required to have. Daryl: It is, I think we are just proactive in managing our balance sheet, we always want to have maintain strong capital and liquidity versus our peers and I think we're doing that. Bible: It is, I think we are just proactive in managing our balance sheet, we always want to have maintain strong capital and liquidity versus our peers and I think we're doing that. Betsy: So there could be an opportunity to move NIM the other way once the rules are finalized. Graseck: So there could be an opportunity to move NIM the other way once the rules are finalized. Morgan: So there could be an opportunity to move NIM the other way once the rules are finalized. Stanley: So there could be an opportunity to move NIM the other way once the rules are finalized. Daryl: Potentially that's true; we just need to get some new rules out there. Bible: Potentially that's true; we just need to get some new rules out there. Operator : And we'll take our next question Keith Murray, ISI. Keith: Just to ask a question, you are talking about potentially stronger loan growth in 3Q? Sounds like other banks have kind of topped down 3Q relative to 2Q a little bit. Just curious what you're seeing there trend wise. And are you seeing a pickup in CapEx at all? Murray: Just to ask a question, you are talking about potentially stronger loan growth in 3Q? Sounds like other banks have kind of topped down 3Q relative to 2Q a little bit. Just curious what you're seeing there trend wise. And are you seeing a pickup in CapEx at all? ISI: Just to ask a question, you are talking about potentially stronger loan growth in 3Q? Sounds like other banks have kind of topped down 3Q relative to 2Q a little bit. Just curious what you're seeing there trend wise. And are you seeing a pickup in CapEx at all? Kelly: I'll give you a little color and then Clarke can add some more. So our momentum was just so strong building through the second and frankly its carrying right over the end of the third. We just think that the front half of our Q3 is going to be stronger than the back half. And so that's why we're saying that the Q3 to be a little higher than the range of 35, but you got some seasonality when you head into the fourth and our mortgage warehouse has been driving some of the growth, we are expecting that to soften (a bit to change which would be a (good) [ph] factor but we are not expecting the general market to decline but it's just some seasonal factors and some particular product factors that are causing us to give that somewhat conservative guidance. King: I'll give you a little color and then Clarke can add some more. So our momentum was just so strong building through the second and frankly its carrying right over the end of the third. We just think that the front half of our Q3 is going to be stronger than the back half.

Clarke: Keith, Kelly's point, we ended the quarter strong, in the period growth rate was actually higher than our average. The end of period came in double-digits, so that's clearly going to carry us over in the third quarter but to your question about CapEx, what we are seeing is some more new money issuance around mostly M&A, so a little bit more CapEx overall but more on the M&A front that's driving some of the demand that we're seeing, a little less on the capital return. Starnes: Keith, Kelly's point, we ended the quarter strong, in the period growth rate was actually higher than our average.

Unidentified: Okay. And then just curious if your credit result this quarter included Shared National Credit exam and then you guys have been pretty vocal about what you have seen going on, on leverage lending market, are you surprised at all that the industry hasn't seen more of an impact from the Shared National Credit review? Thanks. Analyst: Okay. And then just curious if your credit result this quarter included Shared National Credit exam and then you guys have been pretty vocal about what you have seen going on, on leverage lending market, are you surprised at all that the industry hasn't seen more of an impact from the Shared National Credit review? Thanks. Clarke: Yes, Keith, this is Clarke. Our results do include full results for our portfolio around our SNC exam, so we were quite pleased and not surprised however at our results and certainly think, I would just suggest there is more to come elsewhere in the industry because there clearly is a lot of pressure from the agencies on labor twining. And I think you will see that impacted come out as we move forward. Starnes: Yes, Keith, this is Clarke.

And I think you will see that impacted come out as we move forward. Operator : We will take our next question from Matt Burnell, Wells Fargo Securities. Matt: Good morning, folks, may be a couple of follow-up questions. You have mentioned a couple of times that the mortgage warehouse was a meaningful contributor to the C&I growth. I guess I am curious as to if you excluded the mortgage warehouse effect, what was the annualized growth in C&I lending relative to the reported 10%? Burnell: Good morning, folks, may be a couple of follow-up questions. You have mentioned a couple of times that the mortgage warehouse was a meaningful contributor to the C&I growth.

I guess I am curious as to if you excluded the mortgage warehouse effect, what was the annualized growth in C&I lending relative to the reported 10%? Daryl: So, I think our commercial growth was about 9% for the quarter. If you excluded the warehouse I think we are more in the may be the 6% range in C&I ex the warehouse, so we did have a seasonal increase which was certainly a contributor but we still had underlying to warehouse strong growth overall. Bible: So, I think our commercial growth was about 9% for the quarter. If you excluded the warehouse I think we are more in the may be the 6% range in C&I ex the warehouse, so we did have a seasonal increase which was certainly a contributor but we still had underlying to warehouse strong growth overall. Matt: Okay and then for my second question. Daryl, you mentioned I think earlier in the call that your duration of the portfolio was down to a little bit more than four years. That compares to the 5.1 year duration you had at the end of the first quarter and it looks like you've become a little bit more asset sensitive roughly 25% more asset sensitive, is that a reasonable way to think about it and could you give a little more color on the duration of the securities portfolio? Burnell: Okay and then for my second question. Daryl, you mentioned I think earlier in the call that your duration of the portfolio was down to a little bit more than four years. That compares to the 5.1 year duration you had at the end of the first quarter and it looks like you've become a little bit more asset sensitive roughly 25% more asset sensitive, is that a reasonable way to think about it and could you give a little more color on the duration of the securities portfolio?

Daryl: Yes, I think the main driver for our change in asset sensitivity was both we had a large growth in commercial which is mainly floating rate assets and we continue to have strong growth in BDA which is more of a fixed rate funding source. So, those two are the main drivers for the change in asset sensitivity. From our duration portfolio perspective, we continue to make our investments shorter on average of what the portfolio is by just trying to shorten up because get ready for when rates start to rise in next couple of years. Bible: Yes, I think the main driver for our change in asset sensitivity was both we had a large growth in commercial which is mainly floating rate assets and we continue to have strong growth in BDA which is more of a fixed rate funding source.

From our duration portfolio perspective, we continue to make our investments shorter on average of what the portfolio is by just trying to shorten up because get ready for when rates start to rise in next couple of years. Matt: And where would you like the duration to be eventually? Burnell: And where would you like the duration to be eventually? Wells: And where would you like the duration to be eventually? Fargo: And where would you like the duration to be eventually? Securities: And where would you like the duration to be eventually? Daryl: I think long term our bank's portfolio duration should probably be anywhere around three and a half years give or take. Bible: I think long term our bank's portfolio duration should probably be anywhere around three and a half years give or take. Operator : And we will take our next question from Nancy Bush, NAB Research, LLC. Nancy: Kelly, there was a question earlier about the auto lending business and you are big in auto-lending and I realized you are not low sub-prime but you are in the sub-prime segment, you are also in premium finance et cetera. Could you just tell us a little bit about your interactions and relationship with the CFPB and where do you think any of these businesses are going to draw more attention there going forward?

Could you just tell us a little bit about your interactions and relationship with the CFPB and where do you think any of these businesses are going to draw more attention there going forward? Kelly: Nancy, on the premium finance we have not had any discussions with them or draw it about all. I don't think they are focusing on that because as you know that's a business -- primarily business type of financing commercial, so I don't think they are really into deep. In the auto space, they are really focused on it and they are focused on the dealer activity. They are focused on whether or not there is discriminatory pricing at the dealer level and as you know the CFP does not have a direct responsibility or part of it regarding the dealer, so they're getting out it through the banks.  So we have had discussions with them as have all the auto financiers. They've not been real transparent in terms of any rule making, in terms of what they are looking for. They just don't want to see discriminatory lending which of course we don't either. It's tricky with regard to auto lending because in auto financing we don't yet raise in gender information. It's nonessential information in terms of financing and auto appliance. So we don't get that information. So we're going through to be honest a kind of a convoluted process where about we are being required to kind of extrapolate what might be happening out there and to be perfectly launch, as I am pretty uncomfortable with it because I'm not sure it's really very accurate and not sure if its really fair. But nonetheless we are all being required to bring pressure on dealers if there is any apparent discrimination with regard to pricing. And everybody's trying to figure out how to do that and it's a very-very gray transitory kind of a process. King: Nancy, on the premium finance we have not had any discussions with them or draw it about all.

And everybody's trying to figure out how to do that and it's a very-very gray transitory kind of a process. Nancy: Thank you, that's helpful. And just as an add-on, you mentioned that the builder business is very strong and that you are running -- seeing shortages of lots now which is certainly a different situation than we had a couple of years ago. But could you just give us some geographic color on that? How are the markets sort of fairing throughout the Southeast? We know that Florida has been strong, but everything is cold there, it seems to be. So how are you fairing throughout your other markets? Bush: Thank you, that's helpful.

We know that Florida has been strong, but everything is cold there, it seems to be. So how are you fairing throughout your other markets? Kelly: Well, it's really beginning it could be fairly broad-based. As I mentioned earlier, the North Carolina which you know was a lag, the North Carolina has come back strong; the Triangle is doing well. Charlotte is doing well. North Atlanta is booming now. Now South Atlanta is not because you will still hear some carryover of excess inventory in Atlanta, but Nancy, what that is the development of lots and Atlanta got way out of control, went way south of Atlanta out into the farms and started converting corn fields into lots, and it would be a long time before that comes back.  But most of the growth has been and will continue to be in North Atlanta and is doing great. Texas is doing great. So I don't think we have any, what I would call bad places today. And some are stronger than others. But it's mostly around the urban areas. So you think about what you would expect; urban areas, the Charlottes, the Raleighs, the North Atlantas, the Gulf Coast et cetera, those areas are not booming. I wouldn't say they're booming, but they're doing well. And its coming back. I'm pleased to say, in a pretty reasonable fashion. You're not seeing -- you're seeing more equity and deals. You're seeing people not wanting to build a 1,000 houses at one time. So now a lot of the activity is driven by the national players and a lot of their financing is being done in the national credit markets. So you're not seeing as much of the credit expansion in the banks, in the A&D as you would see from the whole volume, because of the credit markets. But it's still now over to where the good solid, larger locals who made it through the prices are doing a good bit of activity which as you know is kind of more where our bread-and-butter is.

Operator : We will take our next question from Matthew O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matthew: Just want to follow up on your comment about loan loss reserve release coming to an end. I think similar banks have start to suggest this is the case. But what's kind of the limiting factor or metric. On page eight of our deck, you show all the coverage ratios going up relative to loans that's coming down but obviously the quality of the book overall continues to improve. So just wondering what's the limiting ratio from an outside perspective that we can be looking on? O'Connor: Just want to follow up on your comment about loan loss reserve release coming to an end.

On page eight of our deck, you show all the coverage ratios going up relative to loans that's coming down but obviously the quality of the book overall continues to improve. So just wondering what's the limiting ratio from an outside perspective that we can be looking on? Clarke: Matt this as Clarke. As you know we look at a number of metrics and factors in our model not just a particular ratio -- any one particular ratio, so there is not really a binding constraint necessary in one area. But obviously our reserves stand at 1.27% very strong coverages, but where the releases having been coming from has been the liquidation of the older higher yield advantages as Kelly said earlier, the fact that our NPAs are moving more toward a normalized level. We just wouldn't expect substantial or if any releases going forward, as our non-performers have more or less moderated and we're down to a more normalized level of absolute reserve percentage, so that's really what's driving our thought at this point. Starnes: Matt this as Clarke.

Unidentified: And then just separately, Daryl you mentioned the tax rate will go up a little bit in the third quarter, where do you expect it to go and is that a good run rate level as we think about next year and beyond? Analyst: And then just separately, Daryl you mentioned the tax rate will go up a little bit in the third quarter, where do you expect it to go and is that a good run rate level as we think about next year and beyond? Daryl: Yes, Matt I would probably say we are in the 27% range for the next couple of quarters and as you get out into '15 as our pre-tax income continues to climb, our tax rate will climb a little bit as well, so maybe in the upper 20% range into '15. Bible: Yes, Matt I would probably say we are in the 27% range for the next couple of quarters and as you get out into '15 as our pre-tax income continues to climb, our tax rate will climb a little bit as well, so maybe in the upper 20% range into '15. Operator : We will take our next question from Sameer Gokhale with Janney Capital. Sameer: I wanted to just touch on something that you mentioned earlier Kelly. I think if I heard you correctly, you talked about some of the expense controls and some of the benefits coming from reconceptualizing some of your businesses. And I was wondering if you could give us a couple of examples of what exactly that means. Are you changing go to market strategies for example, in some of your businesses -- just a couple of examples to help us think about how you are expecting to get those expenses as you reconceptualize these businesses would be helpful? Gokhale: I wanted to just touch on something that you mentioned earlier Kelly.

Are you changing go to market strategies for example, in some of your businesses -- just a couple of examples to help us think about how you are expecting to get those expenses as you reconceptualize these businesses would be helpful? Kelly: Yes, so let me give you a conceptual response. I don't know if Ricky Brown President of our community banking give you some color in that particular area. So really going back 2, 2.5 years ago, I challenged all of our leaders to begin to reconceptualize the businesses into context of the new world. I mean make no mistake about it, we operate in a new world today in terms of regulatory costs, in terms of digital banking as there are lot of factors that are changing substantially the way you have to think about banking as we go forward. So we have simply said, we are going to restructure the backroom and the front room to be a major player and driver in the new environment and our business leaders are doing a really good job on that and let me ask Ricky Brown to give you a sense of how he is approaching that and the community bank. King: Yes, so let me give you a conceptual response. I don't know if Ricky Brown President of our community banking give you some color in that particular area.

Ricky: We've been working on this reconceptualization now for several years, so it's just an ongoing process this go around in the second, third and fourth quarter and we've been looking at every position in the community bank. It's broad based in terms of geographic dispersion of the reconceptualization. It's looking at roles, what people do, it's looking at processes, it's looking at how we work with policies and procedures, its really looking at how we enable our people to do their jobs better. And so it is a very significant restructuring. It will have significant improvement in our cost run rate of the community bank. But at the same time, we feel like we can maintain for us, historic high levels of client service quality, high levels of engagement from our associates, maintain a little level of turnover which we've been managing to and effectively we'll be able to get the revenues that are available in this marketplace at lower cost i.e. driving a better bottom line. So we feel very good about what we've been doing. It's been built from the ground up, this was not something that I just said, go do, we did this from the ground up. We've been looking at the context of a very difficult revenue environment, you've heard that from us and others in the industry.  Yes, so we think this is the right thing to do while continuing to be focused on how we do business. I mean we're focused on client service quality, we are a highly consultative company relative to our sales efforts, we're very integrated and our community banking model serves us well because it allows us to continue be close to our customers.  So we think that this restructuring and this ongoing optimization effort is a very important aspect of our business and we think we're getting good understanding as we roll this out and we feel very good about our ability to pull this off, we've done it several times in the last several years, this is just an ongoing effort to find that most optimum mix of how we do, what we do the best cost to get the best results. So we're very optimistic about what's going on.

So we're very optimistic about what's going on. Sameer: And then just another question in terms of your C&I loans I mean I would say it's been fairly broad based C&I growth which banks have benefitted from. But when I try to reconcile that, what's going on with yields and net interest margins, that's where I have some difficulty thinking about whether that growth is good growth. So this is where it maybe not just a question directed at you but more generally also how should folks think about C&I growth? Because, yes, maybe demand's picking up, but from the yield and margin compression, that suggests that there is innocence in oversupply of these loans relative to the demand. So what point do you think maybe we should dial back on C&I lending even because the margins just aren't there, so how should we think about that? Thank you.

That's a great question. It continues to be highly competitive. I think what you are seeing in our portfolio and across the industry is the continual trend of the old one, it's running off at higher spreads and the new one's going own at lower spreads, so you are exactly right. For us we are encouraged to some degree in that while we continue to experience the old one run off, we are beginning to see some stabilization in our new spreads. So for example in our C&I business, our spreads in 2Q were about 190 basis points, were about a 185 basis points in the first quarter. So for us, our belief and hope is that if we stay disciplined in our pricing and our risk selection that as those old managers burn down if we can have some continuity in those spreads quarter-to-quarter then we will see that pick up in choke in our net interest income. Starnes: Sameer, this is Clarke. That's a great question. It continues to be highly competitive.

Daryl: And also remember that does not include any fee income or other ancillary businesses. So when we look at the returns on these assets, we're well in excess of a 15% return on equity probably north of 20%. Plus these are floating rate assets, so that we will benefit as these basically reprice when rates start to go up. Bible: And also remember that does not include any fee income or other ancillary businesses. So when we look at the returns on these assets, we're well in excess of a 15% return on equity probably north of 20%. Plus these are floating rate assets, so that we will benefit as these basically reprice when rates start to go up. Operator : Yes, we will take our next question from Mike Mayo, CLSA. Mike: Can you elaborate on some of the system conversions specifically the conversion of the general ledger? When is that targeted in the past, you said it was going to be done in the summer and how are the prospects looking? Mayo: Can you elaborate on some of the system conversions specifically the conversion of the general ledger? When is that targeted in the past, you said it was going to be done in the summer and how are the prospects looking? CLSA: Can you elaborate on some of the system conversions specifically the conversion of the general ledger? When is that targeted in the past, you said it was going to be done in the summer and how are the prospects looking? Daryl: Yes, Mike this is Daryl. I can tell you that we converted our first piece of our financial system, this summer we actually completed it in the May-June time frame that was our fixed assets accounts payable, tax piece. We are looking at doing the actual GLPs in the next quarter or two. And then in '15 as we get out there, the system that we're doing basically has a database and that will start to be converted throughout '15 and that will take couple several conversion. So from beginning to end, it's probably a two year process. We had good progress at the start and we're continuing to get ready and we've been working very hard to get through these conversions. So I think we're making good progress. Bible: Yes, Mike this is Daryl. I can tell you that we converted our first piece of our financial system, this summer we actually completed it in the May-June time frame that was our fixed assets accounts payable, tax piece. We are looking at doing the actual GLPs in the next quarter or two. And then in '15 as we get out there, the system that we're doing basically has a database and that will start to be converted throughout '15 and that will take couple several conversion. So from beginning to end, it's probably a two year process. We had good progress at the start and we're continuing to get ready and we've been working very hard to get through these conversions. So I think we're making good progress. Mike: So when you say the next quarter or two for the GL by what timeframe? Mayo: So when you say the next quarter or two for the GL by what timeframe? CLSA: So when you say the next quarter or two for the GL by what timeframe? Daryl: I would say definitely by the first -- end of the first quarter. Conversions in the fourth quarter have a little bit more risk. It all depends on how you're testing from UAT goes and if there is any remediations, if you have enough time to remediate and still pass stocks compliances. So we may try to do it by the end of the year. And if we don't get it done by the end of the year, we'll get it done in the first quarter. Bible: I would say definitely by the first -- end of the first quarter. Conversions in the fourth quarter have a little bit more risk. It all depends on how you're testing from UAT goes and if there is any remediations, if you have enough time to remediate and still pass stocks compliances. So we may try to do it by the end of the year. And if we don't get it done by the end of the year, we'll get it done in the first quarter. Mike: And as far as improving the efficiency ratio from 59% to 56%. Could you say you might go and get there by the third quarter, is that still a fourth quarter number? Mayo: And as far as improving the efficiency ratio from 59% to 56%. Could you say you might go and get there by the third quarter, is that still a fourth quarter number? CLSA: And as far as improving the efficiency ratio from 59% to 56%. Could you say you might go and get there by the third quarter, is that still a fourth quarter number? Kelly: That's still fourth quarter Mike. King: That's still fourth quarter Mike. Mike: And to the extent that the system conversions are little bit letter, what gives you the confidence that you can still meet the 56% target even while you won't have done the conversion that I presumably still have some dual systems. Mayo: And to the extent that the system conversions are little bit letter, what gives you the confidence that you can still meet the 56% target even while you won't have done the conversion that I presumably still have some dual systems. CLSA: And to the extent that the system conversions are little bit letter, what gives you the confidence that you can still meet the 56% target even while you won't have done the conversion that I presumably still have some dual systems. Kelly: Well, that's clearly a good question, that's the kind of dynamics we have to deal with when we're trying to make these kind of projections, it's really challenging to be as specific as we're trying to be, but we're just trying to be helpful and transparent. But you're right I mean things move around. So to the extent that the GL doesn't convert in, the fourth quarter goes sort of first quarter that pushes upward pressure with regarding to hitting 56%. But for that reason, we are developing some insurance strategies to do some other things that would offset that if that does not occur. So again I can't guarantee the 56% but we'll try to incorporate some of those contingencies and are thinking as we look forward. King: Well, that's clearly a good question, that's the kind of dynamics we have to deal with when we're trying to make these kind of projections, it's really challenging to be as specific as we're trying to be, but we're just trying to be helpful and transparent.

But for that reason, we are developing some insurance strategies to do some other things that would offset that if that does not occur. So again I can't guarantee the 56% but we'll try to incorporate some of those contingencies and are thinking as we look forward. Mike: And then last follow up. More guidance is always better. But if you were to get three items that help to offset that lack of benefits on the systems side, what would those say three items be? Mayo: And then last follow up. More guidance is always better. But if you were to get three items that help to offset that lack of benefits on the systems side, what would those say three items be? Daryl: Besides personnel costs, I think we're pretty confident that our regulatory costs will fall. Even and will of our GL conversion, I still think our professional expenses will continue to fall and discretionary costs I think will continue to fall. So I think we have enough momentum that we will drive our expenses down through all those items by the fourth quarter. Bible: Besides personnel costs, I think we're pretty confident that our regulatory costs will fall. Even and will of our GL conversion, I still think our professional expenses will continue to fall and discretionary costs I think will continue to fall. So I think we have enough momentum that we will drive our expenses down through all those items by the fourth quarter. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

Kelly King : Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for your interest in BB&T and thanks for joining our call. So I'd say, recall, our third quarter is overall a strong quarter; solid loan and core deposit growth, positive operating leverage, and we have some very important, I think, strategic initiatives. If you look at the highlights on earnings, net income totaled $520 million versus $268 million in third quarter '13. Diluted EPS was $0.71 compared to $0.37. Now, remember the third quarter '13 had tax-related reserve adjustment. We did have a $0.01 reduction in earnings due to merger and restructuring charges, so overall a really solid quarter. ROA was 1.19%. Internal tangible common equity was a strong 15.04%. Net revenues were up 1.7% to $2.3 billion. T hat was largely due to high mortgage income, service charges and other fee income, and it did really overcome our seasonal decline in insurance, which is always a challenge for us. Very strong fee income ratio at 44%, so we feel good about fundamental earnings. Loans grew 4.9% versus second quarter, led by C&I, CRE, direct retail, sales finance, other lending subsidiaries, all was really broad-based. If you x residential mortgages, loans grew 8.8%, which is very, very good. We did, if you noticed in the releases, we did sell about $550 million in loans, primarily TDRs recorded a $42 million gain, which was reflected as a reduction in the provision for credit losses that resulted in unusual net charge-offs of $15 million, but it will reduce regulatory and servicing costs going forward. We also had a significant unusual item and we extinguished $1.1 billion of FHLB advances, which were costing 4.15% on average, and we took a $122 million pre-tax loss. We were able to replace that with less expensive short-term funding. And so that does improve earnings runs rate immediately, so another good positive for us. In terms of our strategic announcements, we had a really exciting quarter. We announced our agreement to acquire another 41 branches and $2.3 billion in deposits in Texas from Citibank. If you recall, that follows the 21 branches that we acquired in the second quarter. So now we are 13th largest bank in Texas. I think when we started in 2009, we were 53rd. So in five years we've gone 53rd to 13th. We've got a long way to go, frankly, to get into the top five, but we love Texas and we are moving and feel very excited about those acquisitions. Really excited about the agreement to acquire the Bank of Kentucky, $1.9 billion in assets; 32 branches in the northern part of Kentucky and really the Greater Cincinnati area. We're excited about having number two market share in Kentucky; strong market position in the Greater Cincinnati market, which as you know is a large, fast-growing, and for us a very diversified market. So we're excited about that strategic initiative move as well. If you go to Slide 4, I just want to amplify on these unusual items, so that they will be clear. So the gain on loan sale did increase charge-off by $15 million. It did produce $26 million of after-tax gain as well a positive $0.04 impact on EPS. The loss on the extinguishment of debt, which is shown as a separate line item in the non-interest expense category was $76 million after-tax, but had some negative $0.11. We had an income tax adjustment on a negotiated issue with the IRS, we showed it in the tax provision, of course, that was $50 million after-tax, so that's $0.07 positive. And then we had the merger related and restructuring charges, which was a negative $0.01. So you can see, the first three items really kind of wash out, and then you just have a $0.01 negative impact due to merg. So a relatively clean quarter, once you kind of work through those, and really all the changes were positive. So we felt pretty good about that. I would point out, however, with all the changes, it does create positive improvement and earnings looking forward from the loan sale and the debt extinguishment, which is really good. If you look at Slide 5, I'll say, overall, I'm very pleased with loan growth, especially given that's a really tough competitive environment out there. Also we did have some strong seasonal growth. If you look at commercial loan growth, it was very robust in the quarter. C&I was up $509 million, about 5.1% annualized. That was led by large corporate lending, growth and mortgage warehouse. CRE lending is currently mostly larger participations, very competitive, so very tight-spreads. We are holding our guns with regard to our quality. So we're getting growth, but it's challenging out there. We're not expecting C&I to be strong in the fourth quarter, because we'll have continued slowdown in mortgage warehouse lending likely. Although, I pointed out last couple of days, yields have been dropping like crazy, so who knows it might be up a lot, so we'll see how that goes. If you look at CRE construction and development growth of 16.1%, that was led by fundings on the multi-family construction loans. Really the largest geographical area there is North Carolina, D.C., Atlanta, South Florida and the Gulf Coast of Florida. We do expect that this will continue, as we still have just north of a $1 billion on unfunded multi-family commitment. So we think that will have legs as we go into the fourth. In CRE, income producing increased 8.2% annualized. This is led by retail property financing for acquisitions, refinancings and multi-family. Saw growth in office and industrial properties for the first time in a while, and this is really one of the most balanced quarters we've had in IPP, and we feel good about that. Average direct retail lending continues to have legs and is increasing, increased about 12.7%. Continue to accelerate due to HELOC, direct auto lending in the branches, so that's really a big fee change for us in the last three or four months. Wealth continues to make a nice contribution to direct retail lending, up substantially. So we expect direct retail to continue to accelerate in the fourth quarter. Residential loan were down 5.2% and includes a sale of essentially all of our conforming loans, which was the change we made about 90 days ago and the sell of TDRs. So total originations were actually up $5 billion, about 24% over the last quarter, and we'll see how they go this quarter, again, depending on refis. Other lending subsidiaries was a very strong part for us, very strong 25.6% annualized growth. Seasonally strong performance from insurance premium finance at 36%; Sheffield prime consumer lending up 27%; Equipment Finance up almost 11%; and Regional Acceptance, our sub-prime auto lender, was up 15.4%. So we expect these businesses to slowdown in the fourth quarter, because it's just seasonally. We said they would pop up in the third, and they'll go down in the fourth, it's very, very predictable, very seasonal. Looking forward, we expect average loans to decline on an annualized basis in the fourth quarter about 1% to 2%. Now, it's largely due to lower residential mortgage balances, due to our loan sale and pullback on our part and prime auto lending due to tight loan spreads. But this may change by, but it's just gotten so tight, it just wasn't going to -- the yields are just not good enough to be really aggressive out there. So we're still in the business and we still love the business, but we're just trying to be careful about the particular tranches that we're buying, because of some tight spreads. If you exclude the decline in residential mortgage balances, we expect annualized loan growth to be a positive 1.2%, and we do expect growth in direct retail commercial revolving credit and other lending subsidiaries. So if you go to Slide 6, just a comment briefly on deposits. Overall, it's another really good deposit quarter, improved deposit mix, overall total cost. As you see, DDA went up 15.9%, which continue to be strong growth in interest deposits and modest growth in retail. Total deposits were up 3.1%, and that's of course down from the DDA, because we continue to strategically run-off some of our own time deposits, which are just too expensive. We did keep the interest-bearing cost at 26 basis points. Total cost, because of the mix change, reduced from 19 basis points to 18 basis points. Average DDA, very pleased about this, it's 29.2% in third quarter versus 26.8%. So you can see, several year strategy of diversification continues to work on the asset side and on liability side. It's one of the most important things in our business today is diversification. It's by the way one of the reasons we're having a relatively good quarter, and not as worried about all the volatility in the market as some might be, just because of having really strong businesses like insurance, which just do not track the volatility in the stock market and capital market businesses, et cetera, so. Not that we are not concerned about it, but we are really glad to have that insurance under our revenue stream, no pun intended. We added $1.2 billion in deposits for Texas branch acquisition, which I referred to earlier, so nice continued execution on the deposit side. We are proud of all of our people in the community bank and to other parts of our bank in capital markets, corporate banking, that are continuing to make that happen. So let me turn it to Daryl now, and he can give you some more detail and some color. Daryl Bible : Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to talk about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, non-interest expense, capital and our segment results. Continuing on Slide 7. We continue to see overall improvement in credit quality. Third quarter net charge-offs, excluding cover, increased slightly to 48 basis points. Excluding $15 million net charge-offs related to the sale of residential loans, mostly TDRs, net charge-offs were 43 basis points, basically flat from last quarter, down almost 11% from the same period last year. Additionally, loans 30 to 89 and loans 90 days past due decreased compared to last quarter, mostly due to the residential mortgage loans down. Looking forward, we continue to expect net charge-offs to remain between 45 basis points and 50 basis points next quarter, assuming no material decline in the economy. NPAs, excluding cover, declined 3.6% with a 10.2% decrease in commercial NPLs. NPAs as a percentage of total assets remain at their lowest level since 2007 at 48 basis points. Going forward, we expect NPAs to decline modestly in the fourth quarter. Finally, performing TDRs decreased 32.5%, driven by the sale of $550 million in mortgage loans. Turning to Slide 8. Our allowance coverage remains very strong, increasing to 1.82x from 1.78x. We had a reserve release of $17 million, excluding covered activity and change in reserve for unfunded commitments and the impact to the loan sale. This compares to $39 million relief last quarter. Going forward, we anticipate no further reserve releases. Continuing on Slide 9. Margin came in at 3.38%, down 5 basis points from last quarter and in line with our previous expectations. Core margin was 3.2%, down 2 basis points from last quarter. The decline was mostly a result of the impact of the covered asset portfolio, partially offset by improved funding mix changes. Core margin declined due to lower yields on new loan volume. Looking at next quarter, we expect margin to decline 3 basis points to 5 basis points, due to the covered asset run-off and changes in our forecasted loan balances and yields. Additionally, we expect core margin to be relatively flat. Net interest income should be down slightly in the fourth quarter, which includes the impact of purchase accounting. We became more asset sensitive from last quarter, mainly from the asset and funding mix changes. This improvement is partially offset by the early termination of the Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Turning to Slide 10. Our fee income ratio remain steady at 44% in the third quarter. Overall, non-interest income was up slightly compared to last quarter. This was driven by improved mortgage banking, service charges on deposits, investment banking and brokerage fees and commissions, offset by seasonally lower insurance income. Mortgage banking income increased $21 million, mostly due to higher production and gain on sale. Services charges on deposits increased due to one additional day in the quarter and increased commercial account analysis fees. Investment banking and brokerage fees and commissions increased due to volume. Insurance income decreased due to seasonality and property casualty insurance commissions. Overall, we expect modest growth in fee income in the fourth quarter, driven by insurance commissions and lower FDIC loss share. Turning to Slide 11. The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 59.7%, as core expenses came in a bit higher than forecast. Non-interest expense was $1.6 billion, relatively flat compared to last quarter. On a core basis, non-interest expense was $1.4 billion. This quarter included a $122 million loss on the unwind and $1.1 billion at Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Personnel cost decreased $14 million from the prior quarter, due to fewer FTEs and lower equity-based compensation for retirement eligible employees. FTEs declined nearly 800 compared to last quarter. This is the result of completion of several strategic efforts to reduce expenses and lower personnel cost. Other expense and loan-related expense decreased a combined $118 million due to prior quarter adjustments related to the FHA insured loans originated by BB&T. Going forward, we expect expenses to fall below $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter. The main drivers will be lower personnel and legal cost, operating charge-offs and loan-related expense. We are working hard to reach the efficiency target we laid out a year ago. The target became more difficult, because changes in purchase accounting and slower mortgage revenues versus our forecast. However, as Kelly said at our Investor Day, given the number of moving parts, we're more likely to be in the 57% area. We had a favorable development in a tax position with the IRS and recorded a $50 million credit in our provision. Excluding this, our effective tax rate on an adjusted basis was 26.5%. We expect similar tax rate for the fourth quarter. We achieved positive operating leverage and expect the same for next quarter. Turning to Slide 12. Capital ratios remain strong with Tier 1 common at 10.5%, Tier 1 at 12.4%, up from last quarter. Our estimated Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio improved to 10.3% at the end of the third quarter compared to 10% last quarter. Looking at liquidity, under the final rules, our LCR is very strong at 132%, substantially above the minimum requirement of 90% by January 1, 2016. And our liquid asset buffer at the end of the quarter was very healthy at 14.3%. Turning to segment reporting on Slide 13. Loan demand increased significantly versus last quarter in the community bank, with C&I up 6%, CRE up 10% and direct retail loans up 13%. Net income totaled $231 million, up from the prior quarter. Additionally non-interest expense declined $18 million or 11%. In the fourth quarter, we expect to achieve a full run rate from ongoing optimization efforts. We announced two acquisitions in the third quarter, both are expected to close in the first half of 2015. We agreed to purchase 41 city branches in the Dallas, Houston, Midland and Odessa markets, with $87 million in loans, $2.3 billion in deposits. This continues our expansion efforts in Texas. We also announced the acquisition of The Bank of Kentucky, which creates an entry point in the northern Kentucky and Greater Cincinnati. That will mean 32 branches with $1.3 billion in loans and $1.6 billion in deposits. Turning to Slide 14. Residential mortgage, net income rose as gain on sale margins increased to 1.1% in the third quarter from 0.95% last quarter, mostly due to a stronger retail mix. Production mix of refi to purchase was 29% to 71%, consistent with prior quarter. Originations were up 6% to $5 billion versus last quarter and credit quality remained strong. Looking at dealer financial services on Slide 15. Net income totaled $51 million for the quarter. We had strong loan production in prime with 13% average loan growth and 15% for non-prime. Asset quality for our prime auto business continues to exhibit strong performance by historical standards. Our non-prime auto business continues to perform well within management's expectation and risk appetite. Regional Acceptance continues to expand most recently in California, Oregon and Connecticut. Turning to Slide 16. Our specialized lending segment had an excellent quarter, earning net income of $71 million. We had really strong loan growth in Grandbridge, due partly to a new portfolio product introduced earlier this year. Sheffield growth was strong, up 27% annualized versus last quarter, despite increased competition. Equipment Finance and Premium Finance had excellent loan growth of 11% and 36%, respectively. Moving to Slide 17. BB&T Insurance net income was $36 million in the third quarter, a decrease of $21 million compared to the prior quarter. Non-interest income decreased $37 million, reflecting seasonally lower property and casualty and employee benefit commissions, partially offset by new business and solid customer retention rates. Non-interest expense decreased $10 million, mostly driven by lower personnel cost. Turning to Slide 18. Our Financial Services segment generated $71 million in net income, driven by annualized loan growth in corporate banking at 19% and wealth at 37%. Additionally, we saw a transaction deposit growth of 23% and 9% annualized. Wealth continues to grow, setting record loan production for the past two quarters. For next quarter, we see additional modest credit improvement with much higher provision expense due to no further reserve releases, negative annualized loan growth of 1% to 2%, relatively stable revenues and a decline in non-interest expenses. And with that, let me turn it back to Kelly for closing remarks and Q&A. Kelly King : Thank you, Daryl. So as you can see, overall we had a strong quarter, solid loan and deposit growth. Our fee strategy has been really working. Approximately flat expenses with nice improvement opportunity in the forward, based on strategies that I pointed out, that are already in effect. So we did produce operating leverage and several key strategic initiatives that will yield really good long-term benefits. It's a tough environment from a long-term perspective. All of our key strategies are working well, so we feel really positive about our business as it is moving forward, and we remain very bullish on the BB&T performance from a long-term perspective. Let me turn it to Alan now for questions. Alan Greer : Thank you, Kelly. At this time, we'll enter at the Q&A session. Tiffany I would invite you to come back on the line and explain how participants on the call can participate in the Q&A session. Operator : (Operator Instructions) We'll go to the first question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : A couple questions Daryl. I wanted to just see if we could dig into the actions that you took this quarter on the early extinguishment of debt. Maybe if you could give us a sense of what kind of benefit you're expecting that is going to drive. Is it entirely in the 3Q run rate? And then, maybe you could talk to as well other impacts from recent rate moves and how you're thinking about managing with what the markets have given us recently? Daryl Bible : So on the Federal Home Loan Bank unwind that we did, that was done at the very end of the third quarter, basically had almost no impact in the third quarter results. If you look out into the fourth quarter, if you look at our long-term debt line item, that's probably a 13 basis point decline in our cost there. And overall, our interest bearing liabilities, line item should probably be down average about 2 basis points, because of that unwind. As you look about the flattening of the curve that's occurred in the last couple of days, the long-end of the curve has come down easily 50 basis points since the beginning of the quarter, if you look at the tenure, maybe a little bit more than that now. If you look at our balance sheet, our balance sheet is pretty well balanced. From an asset liability perspective, we're slightly asset-sensitive, but we have about half of our assets that are fixed and about half are floating rate. So with a flatter curve, that does put a little bit pressure on net interest income. I would say that net interest income would come down maybe in the 1% to 2% range, if this persists next year, which would be between $50 million and $100 million. But then you also have the benefit that Kelly talked about in the beginning, I mean, these lower rates in just two days we've seen refi activity really spiked back up. So we could have back to what we had three or four years ago going through the recession, where you had really strong mortgage activity. So I believe that we could have potentially offset, maybe even benefit with higher mortgage revenues. Diversification is good. Our revenue for net interest income is only 55% fees or 45%, so pretty good balance, which is really why you want to be diversified and balanced overall. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : But just two quick thoughts on that; one on the benefit to long-term debt and interest-bearing deposits that's baked into to your 3 basis point to 5 basis point decline in 4Q for NIM? Daryl Bible : Yes, and that's helping keep our core margin stable. That's correct. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : And the LCR final rule was relatively positive for you. Is there any actions that you're planning on taking differently as a result of that? Daryl Bible : Yes. I think you'll see that the benefits bleed out overtime. I mean that basically, we've got a nice windfall with the treatment of public deposits and operating deposits, account classifications. I think the strategy is we basically need to have less, the higher quality investment securities, HQ1 securities on, so we can maybe buy some more Fannie and Freddie versus Ginnie and Treasuries, so that should give us some slightly higher yield benefits overtime. I wouldn't say we would restructure the balance sheet, I think we just do it as the cash flows come in. If you look at what we've been investing in investments over the last several years, we've been very diversified our investments. We've been buying short floaters, we've been buying intermediate cash flows and some longer cash flows, because we really don't know which way rates are going to go, it's a more diversifying strategy and I'm glad that we stayed with this strategy, if this longer curve persist rather than trying to keep everything short. I think we're very low balanced. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Pancari with Evercore. John Pancari - Evercore: Could you give us some more color on the expenses in the third quarter and maybe how the number has changed versus your expectation that you gave at the Analyst Day. I think you had indicated slightly below $1.4 billion in total expenses, and that came in just above, and how that maybe impacting your outlook for the fourth quarter? And then, separately, if you could talk about '15 expense run rate? Kelly King : So John, as I've mentioned at the Investor Day, we try to be very transparent in January, because obviously our expenses had shot up in '13, and so we said then, which we said repeatedly that we thought that the expenses ratio this year would end in the fourth quarter in the 56% range. Three weeks or so ago at Investor Day, to give a little more transparency, I said, remember you have numerator denominator. We have more control over the numerate than the denominator, and so whether it's high 56% or low 57%, I think it's just not that precise. That went backing up on the context, because in the context I said, 56% range, but anyway, it is challenging to get expenses down today. I'll be very honest. I mean it's a really different environment, because we happen to invest a lot in technology and regulatory systems and process changes. On the other hand, we've been really aggressive this whole year and it hadn't shown up yet, but we've been really aggressive this whole year in terms of making any kind of changes. Daryl said, in the third quarter, FTEs is up 800, and that was just kind of executed towards the end of the third quarter, which takes it into fourth. And so that's a big part of why we feel confident, and are still saying, we'll be down maybe not 56%, and probably 57% as the way it looks at this point. But again, if revenue were to kick up, we still -- you just don't know, it's just not that precise. We just want to dislodge ourselves a little bit from being so exaggerated. We tried to say range in the beginning to make that clear, but I understand the context of your question. The third quarter, if you take out the extinguishment, it was $35 million over the $1.4 billion. We have pretty big business today. We have got $5.5 billion all in the expense range, $35 million is not that much. But we feel confident we'll be under the $1.4 billion for the fourth as we go into the '15. All the strategy that we've put in place will be continued. They are not something that we did just for one quarter. That would be continuous. Now, there will be other factors that may impact expenses for '15, for example, it's rates really drop, you've got some impact on pension expense and so forth. So it's too early to know exactly what's dropping the expenses. But those are factors that are not, in short-term, controllable by management. What we can control or reconceptualize by restructuring our businesses, so that they run more efficiently even in this very tight environment we're in today. All of the things we said in the beginning of the year have been done. They are now in execution and it's just about time for the run rate flow through the fourth quarter. So I understand there is a lot of questions about that, but we were confident of what we said in the beginning of the year is exactly what we would executed on, and we'll continue that, Daryl as just said, as we head through '15. John Pancari - Evercore: And then with that commentary, just how you've reconceptualized everything, given the topline environment, given the difficult yield curve here, can you talk about '15 in terms of efficiency ratio expectation. Is it fair to assume that we're looking at a 57% full year efficiency ratio for the full year of 2015? Kelly King : Well, I think it's fair to say that if everything were constant, then I'd say it's 57% for '15. But as you know John, this is -- I mean during the last two days we had some more volatility, we've had two years, and prior to that it has been really volatile. So for me to sit here and say a number with regard efficiency at this point would be really, maybe not being forthright, because again, the revenue side, I can't control. I mean, if rates were really low, we'll get NIM pressure, but we'll get fee income increase in terms of mortgages. I don't expect any material changes in terms of a basic run rate expenses that we control, because we can control FTEs and we can control an awful lot of our expense structure. So given what I know today, I would say, I am pretty comfortable for the year with kind of a range of 57%, but there will be volatility within the course of that, given what happens on any one quarter with regard to our revenues. And then as I said, we have -- we do have one unusual fairly large item for us, and that's pension. And the way, you probably know that works is based on discount rate at the very end of the year. If 10 years goes back up, then those expenses will be very low for us and if they go really low then they will be spike enough. To be honest, I don't worry much about that, as I do how many people do you have, and how many branches do you have, and fundamental day-to-day operating expenses that you can manage is more of a non-manageable expense. But I will tell you that I feel very confident in terms of maintaining the efficient structure that we have today and even beginning to see smaller than this year, but incrementally improvements even as we go forward. But the big kick for us and everybody else in this business is getting revenue lift. So if we can keep expenses next year in the 57% range, with a kind of modest growth we're expecting, that would be a wonderful thing. If the economy gets a lot better, everything gets better. John Pancari - Evercore: Understood. Operator : And we'll go next to John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Daryl, I was wondering about the mortgage banking revenues were strong this quarter and you mentioned the better gain on sale margin with the retail mix improving. Did you see that kind of gain on sale as sustainable? And just on the origination front, do you expect things to be seasonally lower in the fourth quarter, before any refi impact? Daryl: Yes. I mean, the gain on sale was really driven by the retail activity, plus we had a little bit of increase in our correspondence spreads. So I would say gain on sale spreads prior to the last couple of days we would have expected to be pretty much consistent in the fourth quarter, but the last few days we've had spike up in activity. We have a lot more refi activity. If that really comes through, rather than having softer volume seasonally in the fourth quarter, then you could actually have that as an offset, which could be a windfall for us and the industry on mortgage revenues. It's too early to call, but we definitely saw spikes up in refi volume in the last two days. So I would say mortgage revenue is a wild card right now. Maybe down a little bit, but could be actually better than what we saw in this quarter depending on what happens to refis. Bible: Yes. I mean, the gain on sale was really driven by the retail activity, plus we had a little bit of increase in our correspondence spreads. So I would say gain on sale spreads prior to the last couple of days we would have expected to be pretty much consistent in the fourth quarter, but the last few days we've had spike up in activity. We have a lot more refi activity. If that really comes through, rather than having softer volume seasonally in the fourth quarter, then you could actually have that as an offset, which could be a windfall for us and the industry on mortgage revenues. It's too early to call, but we definitely saw spikes up in refi volume in the last two days. So I would say mortgage revenue is a wild card right now. Maybe down a little bit, but could be actually better than what we saw in this quarter depending on what happens to refis. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : And can you just remind us on the insurance seasonality, then when you go from third to fourth, you typically get that $40 million to $50 million back. Christopher: John, this is Chris. We won't get the whole thing back. You're probably looking at something like a 2% to 3% bump up in fourth. The strongest quarter is first, followed by second, followed by fourth and third is our lowest seasonal quarter. Henson: John, this is Chris. We won't get the whole thing back. You're probably looking at something like a 2% to 3% bump up in fourth. The strongest quarter is first, followed by second, followed by fourth and third is our lowest seasonal quarter. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : And just on the credit. On the credit side, Daryl, how much of that 40 to 50 basis points change-off guidance is kind of a pickup from seasonality you mentioned? Clarke: Hey John, this is Clarke Starnes. We always have defined seasonality in the fourth -- really the second half of the year, but particularly in the fourth quarter in our non-prime auto business, and so really all of the fourth quarter guidance around losses is around the non-prime seasonality. Otherwise, we feel very good about the stability in the credit trends otherwise. Starnes: Hey John, this is Clarke Starnes. We always have defined seasonality in the fourth -- really the second half of the year, but particularly in the fourth quarter in our non-prime auto business, and so really all of the fourth quarter guidance around losses is around the non-prime seasonality. Otherwise, we feel very good about the stability in the credit trends otherwise. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : And do you expect to start building reserves if loan growth continues kind of in the mid-single digit pace, Daryl or Clarke? Clarke: We certainly, at this point, as we said, do not anticipate further reserves based on where our credit trends are, and so we would assume kind of stable reserves unless we had substantial growth and then we would have to pick up provisioning them. Starnes: We certainly, at this point, as we said, do not anticipate further reserves based on where our credit trends are, and so we would assume kind of stable reserves unless we had substantial growth and then we would have to pick up provisioning them. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : You mean growth beyond what you've had recently? Clarke Starnes : That's right. Operator : We'll take our next question from Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank : Just a follow up on some of the expense commentary, and I guess the pension comments specifically. It would be helpful if you could let us know what the pension cost were running this year and did you have any sensitivities, if rates just stay at these levels, just how meaningful that might be for next fiscals? Daryl Bible : I would say our pension cost this year were basically pretty much zero expense, maybe a slight credit due to what happened with rates a year ago. If rates were to stay where they are today, so that would be down basically about a 100 basis points from last year, you could probably see about $100 million increase in pension expense next year. Kelly King : And that could be offset somewhat, because one of the other factors in this is when rate truly dropped and the field expectations are down for the next year, we're able to put additional funding into our pension program and we always keep it fully funded, as much as IRS allows, and that could offset that a bit. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank : Yes, that would be actually my follow-up question, since you have excess capital, and there's not a ton of balance sheet growth, it seems like you've got some flexibility to add there. Kelly King : Yes. Absolutely. We'll add to the max. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank : And then just following up on the mortgage refi comment, I realize this is all very real-time, but a couple of days ago, Wells, had said, not really any signs of a pick-up in refis, obviously since then rates have come down another 20 bps, and I am just trying to compare the two, I don't know if its just too real time to reconcile or if another 20 basis points decline rates actually makes that much of a difference? Kelly King : It's just a real time. Daryl sent me out some numbers couple of days ago, two days our productions almost doubled. Daryl Bible : Say it was up about 30% in the last two days. Kelly King : Yes, right. So it's incredibly hard to predict right now. And I think, we'll would tell you that it's a long time between Monday and Thursday. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank : Yes, I think most equity investors and banks stocks right now say the same thing. Operator : We'll take our next question from Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Erika Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : My first question, Kelly, just a follow-up on John's line of questioning, maybe I'll take the other side of the efficiency equation. You clearly have been good at controlling things that you can't control. As we look out in 2015, one of the revenue generating initiatives that you've invested in over the past year that you think could provide a benefit or lift revenues even absent help from rate backdrop? Kelly King : Well, I think you've got kind of couple of things. You've got just a continuing and building revenue lift coming from the community bank, it just keeps getting better day by day, because overall the markets are getting better. And frankly a lot of strategies that Ricky put in place are just getting better. It's kind of independent of a unique strategy, that's kind of a general strategy. Our insurance business continues to get better everyday. The investment in Crump and all of those businesses are just really, really clicking, they get better everyday. The new markets that we're in is really is kind of an exponential thing. When you go into the market like Texas, it takes you while to get your feet on the ground, and then you're building on, again improving on what you have, then you layer in a couple of new investments like the two city tranches. That gets better. We'll have the opportunity in the Greater Cincinnati market. So there are number of topline initiatives that will positively impact that ratio as well. So I think the final one I would point out is that our wealth strategy is really, really working. I mean, it's probably still got another two or three years of legs, because we were kind of behind to be honest. And Chris have done a great job of working with our wealth team and if they integrate with the community bank, I mean it is just gaining momentum certainly everyday. So I'd isolate all those particular ones, but there are some others, but those would be the main ones. Erika Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And my second question is do you think that there could be an inflection point in the M&A environment in terms of seller willingness, if the curve continues to be this flat going into next year, or said another way, do you expect lower for longer to drive the propensity for conversations for potential sellers? Kelly King : I would say lower for longer leads to longing for improvement and that causes people to really rethink everything to be honest. I think it's an insightful question, Erika. Yes, I think that everybody is already feeling the pressure. I mean if you read commentary from community and midsize bank, they will tell you that they are fighting everyday and we're all fighting, but they're really struggling, because an awful lot of the regulatory and technological costs pushed straight down to them just like they do us. And they are saying they have really competitive conditions out there in terms of lending. So I think every time you add one more weight on the challenges and lower longer is another weight, it causes people to think more seriously about strategic opportunities. And I would expect it to stay a little longer, that would create -- if not an outright discernible inflection point, it will certainly create higher propensity of M&A activity. Erika Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Are the regulators thinking as fluidly, and that obviously you are able to get some smaller deals done, but do you think some of the logged down and some of the more sizable deals can break as well. Just your thoughts there too and I'll step off. Kelly King : Yes. So I'll tell you what I think with regard to what the regulators think, but obviously, no one knows for sure. But I believe the regulators are becoming pretty realistic with regard to this. I think they recognize that the industry needs to consolidate. I think they recognize that there is a lot of skill issues around, a lot of investment companies are having to make to meet the regulatory standards in terms of risk improvement, practices, liquidity improvement, capital stronger, etc. And so yes, I think the regulators are beginning to warm up to the idea of the need for consolidation. I think the key thing is they are not backing down in terms of their absolute expectations with regard to, almost a zero-tolerance with regard to risk management and compliance initiatives. And so if the acquirer has invested the right time and money and has the right attitude with regard to investing in those processes and procedures, then I think the regulators will probably look pretty favorably on that acquisition. If they've not, then I think they'll go, will kill it, dead in its tracks. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Daryl, just with the couple of DOs coming on and you guys making some adjustments with debt retirement piece; I just wanted to see if you can help us understand just the total size of the balance sheet and how it should progress. So you're bringing on a lot more deposits than loans, but I'm wondering if that leads to balance sheet growth or are you actually going to continue to mix other parts of the balance sheet from here. Daryl: Now, that's a good question, Ken. I would tell you from the city Texas branches, what we did with the first acquisition and what we're going to do with this second acquisition is you really won't see hardly any balance sheet growth. We're just going to replace some non-client national market funding with these core deposits. So it basically just improves our overall client funding and improves our liquidity and everything, so all that comes in, and we still get a benefit, because city deposits were actually cheaper than our deposits, so we'll have a benefit there. And as Ricky gets that done then you get more revenue over time from those new markets that we're in. With the Bank of Kentucky, that is basically is going to come in; I would say, our balance sheet won't grow with that, probably little less than $2 billion, $1.5 billion to $2 billion, because that's a full bank with deposits and loans and we have a good loan portfolio, that's going to come in to the market. So the market value on the loan portfolio won't be significant enough. So it's pretty much going to come in, as you see it up for the most part. So I would say about $2 billion higher after we close both of those transactions. Bible: Now, that's a good question, Ken. I would tell you from the city Texas branches, what we did with the first acquisition and what we're going to do with this second acquisition is you really won't see hardly any balance sheet growth. We're just going to replace some non-client national market funding with these core deposits. So it basically just improves our overall client funding and improves our liquidity and everything, so all that comes in, and we still get a benefit, because city deposits were actually cheaper than our deposits, so we'll have a benefit there. And as Ricky gets that done then you get more revenue over time from those new markets that we're in. With the Bank of Kentucky, that is basically is going to come in; I would say, our balance sheet won't grow with that, probably little less than $2 billion, $1.5 billion to $2 billion, because that's a full bank with deposits and loans and we have a good loan portfolio, that's going to come in to the market. So the market value on the loan portfolio won't be significant enough. So it's pretty much going to come in, as you see it up for the most part. So I would say about $2 billion higher after we close both of those transactions. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: And then on the securities portfolio side, you had mentioned that you'll be able to just kind of use the cash flows to remix in these LCR free-up. Has the portfolio size also gotten to be around the same level, and from here it's more just about the remixing? Daryl: Yes. I would say, our portfolio is just a tad over $40 billion. That should probably stay pretty much consistent right now through 2015. We have very strong liquidity ratios, and I think we're fine from that perspective. So I think we'll continue to invest in the very diversified portfolio, some short intermediate and some longer, very good diversification, but I think the size stays pretty much the same. Bible: Yes. I would say, our portfolio is just a tad over $40 billion. That should probably stay pretty much consistent right now through 2015. We have very strong liquidity ratios, and I think we're fine from that perspective. So I think we'll continue to invest in the very diversified portfolio, some short intermediate and some longer, very good diversification, but I think the size stays pretty much the same. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: So then if I would wrap up, then it basically means that, x that $2 billion from the Bank of Kentucky deal, then your earning asset growth will probably be a little bit lower than your loan growth from here? Daryl: I mean, the earning assets were basically just be a function of what comes in with Bank of Kentucky, so that's $1.6 billion. Bible: I mean, the earning assets were basically just be a function of what comes in with Bank of Kentucky, so that's $1.6 billion. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: It mean, x that just from a -- like if the portfolio is about the same, and basically your loan growth is going to drive your -- loan growth will really drive your earning asset growth from here on. Daryl: Yes. So let's say, if we grow loans, call it, 4% next year, our earning assets will be a little less than that, because securities are flat. Bible: Yes. So let's say, if we grow loans, call it, 4% next year, our earning assets will be a little less than that, because securities are flat. Operator : We'll go next to Gaston Ceron with Morningstar Equity Research. Gaston Ceron - Morningstar Equity Research : I just wanted to stay on the M&A theme just for a moment. I think you gentleman discussed, your new position in Texas, after this branch deal, I think you said you were now looking at being on the 13th spot there in Texas, and still not in top five. So I'm just curious, if you can look out a little bit further and just comment on your further aspirations in Texas and how you expect to kind of break into a top five, and any kind of timeframe that that might take you? Kelly King : Well, I think our strategy for Texas going forward will be multifaceted, because we primarily focused on organic growth. We have really good base now of 120 branches and we can grow really fast off of that base organically. As we have been, we will continue to look for partners in Texas. There are a number of institutions there that would make good partners for us we believe. But the Texas Bank has done a really good job, and it's a really good market, and their price to earnings is really high. And today, I would not be willing to pay that kind of price that would be required to buy those institutions. So I think looking at us in terms of any whole bank acquisitions in Texas, odds of that is pretty low, unless things change materially, which I do not expect. So we'll look for opportunities like this city. There could be some more of those in Texas. We would be very aggressive in that. But we'll focus at this point primarily organically in Texas. Now, keep in mind, we are not unilaterally focused on Texas. We have other expansion opportunities. We overtime, we will continue to look for opportunities through M&A to expand in Florida, and maybe in other core existing markets. We certainly over time had indicted that we will continue to look at expansions that are natural extensions of our existing footprint. So you can see that out into the Midwest, maybe push it a little North. We're up there in the Baltimore area, and so some areas up around there are kind of beginning to make some sense. So like we have always done, it's kind of a strategic creep. You're unlikely to see us do something really big and whopping, way out away from where we are. You're more likely to see us do what we've done, which is natural creeping. And you can say, we wouldn't have creeped in Texas, that was a pretty big leap, it was, but it came -- it was intuitive because of the way it came along with the Colonial acquisition. And then once we had that beachhead, just decided to take advantage of it. So the natural extension program is growing incrementally in contiguous markets. Operator : We'll go next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy - RBC: Can you guys share with us, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that there's increased competition for the participation loans that you've got on your books -- excuse me, that you put on your books. Can you tell us how large that portfolio is and where there maybe some concentrations and where you are seeing the competition being the most intense? Clarke Starnes : Our shared credit portfolio, we have about $22 billion in commitment, that's a little under $9 billion in outstandings. And it grew about 13.5% on a linked quarter. So very nice book for you us, good growth. Nothing has changed around our focus on conservative hold sizes, so our average exposures in that book is about $38 million. So it's really fairly modest relative to our size. So we are seeing more in the non-leverage space, which you know, we don't participate in the leverage side. We're seeing more structural concessions in that area, really broad based. So what's happen is the leverage sides had a lot more attention, and there has clearly been the pullback on the bank side. We're seeing more competition in the non-leverage space that we participate in, so we're having to be very cautious and careful about that. But it's really broad based, it's not in any one particular sector as far as the competitive side. As far as our distribution, we don't have any particular concentration. So for us it's very broad based and diversified, primarily around the industry verticals that we cover out of our capital markets area. Gerard Cassidy - RBC: Are the agents primarily the New York banks or who puts together the participation that you guys are most often joining? Clarke Starnes : The real larger banks, not just the large New York banks, that includes large regionals as well. So we share credits with our peer bank regional partners as well. So it's really both. Gerard Cassidy - RBC: And then, a follow-up on the Investor Day, you guys were talking about return of capital, and obviously with the third quarter results, these are the results that you'll put into your CCAR submission in 2015, with a very strong Tier 1 common ratio of over 10%. Two parts; one, what do you guys see in terms of how much maybe you'll ask for? Obviously, last year it was around 30%, if I recall. I would assume it would be something higher. And then, second, what's your comfort level on your Tier 1 Basel III common ratio? Where you think you could have that eventually get to? Kelly King : Well, Gerard, as you know, we've been cautious in terms of trying to establish absolute, because this is still a moving target. Although, I am very pleased that we're beginning to get some specificity, we still don't have the topline corporate unsecured debt requirement, that's not out there. We don't think it's been an issue for us, because we think we're already where everybody is glad to be, and we don't expect any substantial capital charge for us, because of the [ph] G50 charges. So if you assume that the Tier 1 common is around 7%, I would say generally we are comfortable in the 8.5% kind of range, but we would keep a cushion above that for various reasons. Today the cushion is because of waiting for things to settle on down a bit more. The global economic environment is pretty volatile, but there is opportunity there. Now, do we use that opportunity in terms of stronger organic growth, maybe so, but not highly likely to be honest, and we will have good growth, but then stocks will be enough to absorb capital. Well, we think in terms of dividend increase here, but not enough to really absorb the capital, so that gets you to M&A and buybacks. And so I would project or what I prefer would be able to absorb some of that through M&A activity. So if we can, for example, like you saw us do in Bank of Kentucky, if we can do 80-20, 70-30 kind of acquisition, where we can absorb capital that way and be a strategic attractive opportunity, it's just a win-win. Will we consider buybacks, yes. Now, I try to remind everybody that you got to remember, when you talk about buybacks, you got to look at absolute price and the internal rate of return on the investment. So we're not going to go out and buyback just to reduce capital, we'd rather hold on little excess capital and buy it on a dip. But, yes, I think there is some opportunity there. I'm hesitant to nail it down exactly whether it's 8.5% or 9.25%, it will not be that exact about it, because we're going to be flexible and always have opportunity to respond in current conditions. But I think in here, Gerard, and your basic question is, is there a meaningful opportunity for us to increase distributions to our shareholders through some combination, practically M&A and buybacks, and the answer would be, yes. Operator : We'll take our next question from Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets. Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets : On Slide 6, you showed a very good increasing average non-interest bearing deposits. Can you give us some color there, because that's some pretty substantial growth? And then with the two acquisitions, one in Texas and the one in Kentucky, I mean how much more can this grow when those other banks come underneath your ownership? Kelly King : So you're right, it is very strong. It's driven primarily by two general factors. One is, the community bank is doing a really good job in terms of growing non-interest deposits in its structure. Remember that the community bank, independent of the recent acquisition, has a lot of new markets, Florida, Atlanta; all of these are still relatively new for us, since every time we're growing in new commercial accounts, we are increasing DDA. And so we've got that, we've got the Texas situation, we described the Kentucky situation. So the community bank is going to be continuing to have accelerated non-interest bearing deposit growth because of the older, if you will, new markets, and then Texas and Kentucky. The other factor that is driving that is a very, very well executed national corporate banking capital market strategy. That strategy we put in place about four or five years ago. It is just being executed to precision. We've got to a guy named Rufus Yates is on our executive team. He is very experienced in that area, and he's doing a fantastic job, as are all of the members of that team. And so every time we go into Chicago or Cleveland or San Francisco or New York with our capital market structure, and this is people on ground now. You know, we're putting people on the ground, pursuing those corporate relationships, because as Clark continues to say, we are not going to just go out and buy participation, we're not going to out and initiate relationships out of market, where we don't have people on the ground. So I now define the corporate banking strategy market as a national market. But when we are out there picking up those relationships, that's adding on a very, very low base. And so the combination of the community bank excellent execution and the corporate bank excellent execution has given us really good non-interest bearing deposits growth. And I think that will continue for quite a long. Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets : And is there other services coming along, is other fee services coming along with these products? Kelly King : Yes, absolutely. Because one of the things, Paul, that happens in these is, it's not always, but almost always a credit requirement that go along with these and relatively thinly priced. But we are very diligent about our total return expectations. And we're fortunate that we have really, really good product offerings. We have, of course, all the treasury and all that that everybody else has, but we're unique in having really good insurance offerings. And so we do a really good job in terms of over a two to three-year period of time getting pretty good penetration of those large corporate clients. We often time start out with credit and insurance, and in a lot of cases we found we already have credit, and now I mean we already have insurance through our large national insurance deliverer, and we add credit and other things to it. So it's not easy, I'll say that, but we've been very successful at it. Operator : We'll take our next question from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities : I understand the drivers of the revised efficiency ratio and some of the challenges you're having in terms of expenses in the current environment. Just looking into 2015, Daryl, I know you've got some expenses related to some of the back office improvement that you're doing with some of the systems. Given some of the headline recently about cyber-security, is that an area where you could see some incremental increase in cost over the next year or two or is that largely embedded into your thinking with the newer systems? Kelly King : I'll answer that one for you. We are investing and we'll continue to incrementally increase our investment into overall cyber-security, information security space. I have been very active on a national level in terms of chairing the BITS, the Financial Services Roundtable, and have been really concerned and outspoken frankly about the need for all of us to invest more. So BB&T has been focused on this really for the last two or three years at a very intense level. But even so, just in the last six to eight months, Chris Henson and I did a deep dive in terms of our security procedures, and what we felt really good about what we were, we decided to enhance at a substantially increased level. So why we won't be doubling, for example, in a year or something like that, it will be one of the few expense categories that's given a pretty green light in terms of making investments necessary, because we are not going to take this risk. There is risk in that, I don't care what you do, but if there are known risk that we find that we can mitigate, we're going to do it. Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities : Daryl, a follow-up question for you. In terms of the loss sharing income with the change in or the expiration of the commercial loss sharing agreement at the beginning of this month. Should we see a ramp down in terms of that counter of fee revenue item going into 2015 or is that going to stay relatively elevated? Daryl Bible : You know, what I would say, Matt, is that fourth quarter numbers will start to come down, the negative loss share amount. As you get into '15, I would have it continuing come down every quarter thereafter. It won't be zero by the end of '15, but it will probably be half of what it is today, so that drag really starts to fade away as the pace of that falls off. Operator : Due to time restraints, we will turn the call back over to Alan Greer at this time. Alan Greer : Thank you, Tiffany, and thanks again to everyone for joining us today. This concludes our earnings call. Have a good day. Operator : And that concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.",

Thanks for your interest in our company. We really appreciate you joining our call. Overall, I'd say we had a very strong fourth quarter, frankly with almost every area being positive. Solid loan growth, strong non-interest -- deposit growth, really good fee income, very effective expense control, and frankly our overall diversification strategy is really kicking in and really making a difference. We had record earnings for the full year of 2014 and for the fourth quarter. Net income for the year was $2 billion at 28% over 2013. I remembered in 2013, we did have a significant tax adjustment. Fourth quarter earnings totaled $557 million, up 3.7% versus fourth quarter. So, diluted EPS totaled $0.76 for the fourth quarter, up 1.3%. Diluted EPS was $2.75 for the year versus $2.19, which was up 25.6%. Very strong ROA of 1.3% for the quarter, so we felt really good about that. Revenue, I was pleased with, was $2.4 billion, up 9.2% versus the third quarter. So, revenue increase was really due to higher mortgage banking income, seasonally stronger insurance, record quarter for investment banking and brokerage. Very pleased at our fee income ratio with a record 45.8%. In terms of lending, our average loans excluding residential mortgage grew 3.2% versus the third quarter. Growth was led by C&I, CRE, direct retail, and other lending, I'll have a few more comments about that in just a minute. We did announce an agreement to acquire Susquehanna Bancshares, as you probably know, we\u2019re very excited about this. It\u2019s a significant merger, $18.6 billion in assets, $13.6 billion in deposits for 245 retail branches. I've had the opportunity over the last several weeks to visit a lot of their branches, visit a lot of their clients, a lot of their community leaders. I'll tell you, it's a really great company, strong culture, strong community focus, looks just like BB&T. To be honest, I felt a lot better about the acquisition today than when we announced in November, and I felt really good then. This is a really good company and is going to work out to be a really, really important part of our franchise. Also, the Bank of Kentucky is proceeding very, very well. We're going to really enjoy that opportunity in Northern Kentucky and Cincinnati, great opportunity for us. Also a second group of Citi branches are moving right along in terms of the approval process. I'll point out that at this point we anticipate no problems in terms of the approvals. Sort of no guarantees in this world, but everything is tracking along very normally and we anticipate no difficulties in that area. With regard to the expenses, I\u2019d just point out that our adjusted non-interest expense was $1.38 billion, down 12.8% versus the third quarter. Our efficiency ratio was 56.7. I'd like to tell you I was traveling and when the numbers were coming in, Daryl sent me an email and said we will have 56 handle on our efficiency ratio, and I replied him back and said God is good. As you all know, we were working really, really hard to get a 56 handle and we did. So, ex-the unusual items, we were below our $1.4 billion target which we had indicated we thought we could do. So, I'm really pleased about where we are with regard to expense focus. We have a really healthy and intense focus on expenses. Getting much better at distinguishing between what I call routine expenses, which in today's environment you really have to manage very intensely, and expense investments, which support improved risk management revenue growth. So, we can talk about more of that in the Q&A, but I just would say that we are really, really maturing into an excellent expense management company. That hadn't always been our strong suit to be honest, but we're really, really getting to be very good about that today. If you follow along on the slides, look at slide four, I just want to emphasize a couple of special items for the quarter. We did have a mortgage reserve adjustment which we had mentioned earlier in the quarter. That settled down at $27 million pretax, so it was $0.02 negative impact to EPS. We did have a franchise tax benefit adjustment which was a positive $15 million pretax, which was $0.01. We did have an allowance release related to a loan sale. Recall, we sold about $140 million of mostly non-performing loans, which generated a pretax $24 million increase or gain, which was a positive $0.02, and then we did have some regular merger-related restructuring charges which were $18 million pretax and a negative $0.02 with regard to operating type of EPS. So, if you put all that together, it kind of washes out with a net of $0.01 negative to GAAP. In other words, GAAP would be $0.01 lower than what we would consider to be kind of ongoing types of earnings. If you look at page five, I want to spend a minute or two with you with regard to a little color on loans. So, in a loan growth area, we feel really good about our performance, particularly given the market conditions. It\u2019s a relatively slow economy out there, still. It's growing 2.5% to 3%, which is okay, better than a few years ago, but not robust. Competition is still tough, but we remain where we've been consistently through the whole cycle, focused on long-term profitable loan growth with good risk-adjusted returns. We're just not going to be changing quarter-to-quarter. You can probably listen to these calls going back over several years, and you\u2019d hear me and Clarke say the same thing. That's what you will continue to hear. And we're going to make our overall loan growth improvement through strategies and diversification versus changes in terms of underwriting, which to some degree is going on in the marketplace. So, if you look at some of the components, very pleased. Our C&I growth was 4.7%. That's been largely in large corporate, mortgage warehouse, mostly larger participations which of course are pretty competitive and pretty thinly priced, but still improving there for us. Our CRE income-producing was 3.2%. CRE construction, which we've been really forcing or pushing to try to improve, was up 15.2%, and I'm pleased that was very broad-based. Single-family vertical construction is beginning to move after being down flat for a long time; industrial, hospitality, retail really good. Multifamily was flat, which is think is probably an indication that the market is slowing a little bit in that area, which is good. It was getting a bit too heated. So, if you look at our overall commercial, it's 5% for the quarter. Direct retail is strong at 8.7%, and frankly, our momentum there is really, really good, led by HELOC and although wearing some other product focus areas in there. Rick and his team have done a fantastic job in developing some real strategies. We feel better about our retail execution in our branches than we felt in 10 years. So, that's going really, really well. Sales finance is down 2.5%, but that's just strictly seasonal. You'll notice the residential mortgage is down 11.8%. As we telegraphed before, we made a decision early in 2014 second quarter to start selling, basically, all of our conforming loan production and we had the impact of two mortgage sales. So, basically, mortgage activity is down about $1 billion for the year. So, that's a pretty big change. It's strategically exactly where we want to be and we feel good about that. But it does impact the total numbers; you just need to take that into account. So, if you look at our total growth, ex-covered, of course, which are running off, I try to look at kind of how we ought to think about kind of core run rate loan growth and so, if you take -- ex-mortgage, ex-covered and then if you simply take out the sales finance and after case, which are most seasonally affected in the fourth quarter categories, we would be growing about 6.2%. So, feel really good about that that level of core growth. Obviously, the total growth matters in terms of the income statement, but the core growth is what matters in terms of going forward and how we think about future earnings opportunities. So, I just wanted to point out that in our portfolio, there's a lot of questions today about oil and gas. We have a $1.4 billion oil and gas portfolio. I would point out that 78% of that is upstream, 89% of it is reserve base, 17% is midstream, and only 5% service -- oilfield services. And so, we viewed at the highest risk part of this businesses is an oilfield services, so we're in the least risky part of the business. We're lending on proven reserves. We stress tested our portfolio all the way down to $40 and have very little problems even at $40. So, we just don't think oil and gas is that issue for us, frankly, relative to our total portfolio. We do expect loan growth in the first quarter to be 5% to 7% excluding mortgage and frankly, that's because all of our key strategies are working. Corporate is up 23% this quarter. So, that's really got legs and has a good bit more potential as we go forward over the next two or three years. CRE is coming back at 5.6% and that has strong legs. Retail as I indicated is 8% and gaining momentum. Wealth is really, really strong being driven by a lot of support out of the community bank; specializing business is growing very, very well. We of seasonality there, but aside from seasonality, they are just doing really, really well across the Board. And plus add to that in terms of our diversification strategy, our insurance business is just doing fantastic as Daryl will cover it just a little bit. So, overall, I feel really good about our loan execution, particularly given the market. If the market gets better, then we will get better. If the rates go up, we'll get better spreads. That would be good. But for the time being, we're assuming that the year is going to be relatively challenging in the first half, probably get a little better in the second half. We think the Fed will raise rates about the middle of the year notwithstanding what's going on globally and we think there will be some positives kicked in oil prices pretty soon. And so we are thinking as we head into second half of the year that there will be some upward pressure on interest rates and that will serve us and the industry as well. But even if that doesn\u2019t happen we are hunkered down and assuming that it is relatively tough year and we are focusing on execution on our diversification strategies and their working.  If you look at page six just a brief comment, deposit growth continuing to work really, really well, non-interest bearing DDAs up 10.7%. Some good category performances, personnel business and public fund DDA growth was 11.8, 12.3 and 16 respectively versus the fourth quarter of 2013. So we feel good about that. I would point out that our non-interest bearing deposit mix is up to 30% from 21.1% and I think about five years ago it was about 15%. So we've made dramatic improvement in that area over the last several years.  Again, I\u2019d just point that out to illustrate that our diversification strategy is working on asset side and on the liability side. Importantly our cost and total deposits was 0.25% in the fourth versus 0.28% in the earlier period, and so we are continuing to bring our cost down, which we feel good about. So that\u2019s a little color with regard to loans and deposits. Let me turn it to Daryl now to give you some color on some of the key areas. Daryl Bible : Thank you, Kelly and good morning everyone. I'm going to talk about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, non-interest expense, capital and our segment results. Continuing on slide seven. We are pleased to report a very strong fourth quarter. This was partly driven by the improvement we saw in credit quality. Net charge-offs were better than expected coming in at 39 basis points, down 18%. Excluding Regional Acceptance, charge-offs were 21 basis points. Loans 30 to 89 and 90 days past due decreased, mostly due to loans acquired from the FDIC that were performing low. By the way the commercial loss sharing agreement expired last quarter so we don\u2019t refer to them as covered loans any more. However, we continue to have 654 million of mortgages covered under our consumer loss share agreement for the next five years. We expect net charge-offs to remain between 40 and 45 basis points next quarter assuming no material decline in the economy. NPAs declined 16.7% versus third quarter, primarily due to residential mortgage loan sale and a decrease in commercial NPLs of 10.1%. NPAs as a percentage of total assets remained at the lowest level since 2007 at 42 basis points.  We completed our second loan sell this quarter, selling 140 million of mostly non-performing mortgage loans. We received excellent pricing on the transaction. The sell also improve servicing efficiency going forward.  Turning to side eight. Our allowance coverage remains very strong, increasing to 3.2 times from 2.8 times last quarter. Let me highlight our core provision since we had some noise this quarter. We recorded provision of 84 million excluding loans acquired from the FDIC and the provision was reduced by a pre-tax 24 million from the loan sell. Our core provision was a $108 million compared to charge-offs of $102 million, a modest build. Going forward we continue to anticipate no reserve releases. Continuing on slide nine, net interest margin was 3.36% this quarter, down two basis points, a bit better than our expectations. Core margin was 3.20, stable compared to last quarter. The small decline in GAAP margin resulted from lower loan balances and lower yields on new loans, offset by stronger interest recoveries, lower funding cost and a change in a funding mix. Looking at next quarter, we expect GAAP margin to decline in the mid-single digits given that rates have fallen, plus continued runoff of loans acquired from the FDIC. Core margin should remain fairly stable in light of our ability to offset lower new loans yields with improved funding mix. We expect net interest income to be down a bit due to margin decline and two fewer days. We remain slightly asset sensitive and continue to be in a good position to benefit when interest rates start to rise. Turning to slide 10, we had a really strong quarter from a fee income produced in businesses. Our fee income ratio improved to a record 45.8% for the quarter. Total fee income exceeded $1 billion; a 29% annualized increase compared with last quarter. This performance was led by insurance, up $24 million, primarily due to seasonal strength in property and casualty commissions.  In addition, mortgage banking increased $21 million, driven by the revaluation of MSR, higher gain on sale spreads and stronger commercial mortgage volume. BB&T Capital Markets had a record quarter led by both equity and fixed income businesses, resulting from a $17 million increase in investment banking and brokerage fees and commissions. Turning to slide 11, our adjusted non-interest expense totaled $1.38 billion for the quarter, down 13% compared with adjusted expenses from last quarter. This excludes relevant items that Kelly discussed on page four of our presentation. Expenses benefited this quarter from lower insurance related costs, lower FTEs and a decrease in IT expenses. Combined with solid growth in revenues, we achieved our goal of efficiency ratio of 56.7% for the quarter. Looking at taxes, our effective tax rate was 27.9% and should increase to about 30% in the first quarter. This increase will be driven by the adoption of new tax credit accounting the first quarter, which will show higher non-interest income and income taxes. Looking forward, the first quarter is seasonally challenging, driven by two fewer days, higher fringe costs and higher pension cost due to lower interest rates.  Turning to slide 12. Capital ratios remained very strong with Tier 1 common at 10.6% and Tier 1 at 12.4%. Our estimated Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio was strong at 10.3%. Capital ratios were affected by the expiration of the commercial loss share agreement which increased the bank\u2019s risk weighted assets. Looking at liquidity, our LCR was very strong at 130%, substantially above the minimum requirement of 90% by 2016. And our liquid asset buffer at the end of the quarter was very healthy at 13.6%. Looking briefly at our segments. On slide 13, community bank had a very good quarter with segment net income up 10% compared with last quarter. Largely due to lower credit and personnel cost.  On slide 14, the mortgage segment performed better versus like and linked quarters, driven by improved gain on sale margins, better MSR performance and lower provision due to loan sales. On slide 15, the dealer financial services had a decline in segment income due to higher provision expenses driven by seasonally higher net charge-offs in Regional Acceptance. On slide 16, specialized lending was down versus linked quarter, driven by seasonality in Sheffield and premium finance. On slide 17, insurance had a strong quarter due to strong insurance commissions at Crump Life, at McGriff, Seibels & Williams, plus improved operating margins. On slide 18, financial services segment net income was up driven by BB&T Capital Partners and Investment Banking.  In summary, we had a really strong quarter driven by credit quality, fee income and lower expenses. We continue to make investments in systems and processes which will pay off in a long run. Now let me turn it back over to Kelly for his closing remarks and Q&A. Kelly King : Thanks Daryl. As you've heard it really was an excellent quarter, solid loan growth and very strong fee income. Very pleased about our expense control focus. All of our key strategies are working. We are very excited about our mergers. To be honest relative to the market I feel really good about our future performance and look forward to discussing that you as we go forward.  So I will turn it back to Alan for Q&A. Alan Greer : Thank you, Kelly. At this time we will begin our Q&A session. Kim, if you would come back on explain how our listeners can participate in this session. Operator : Absolutely. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from John McDonald of Sanford Bernstein. John McDonald : Yes, hi. Good morning. Wondering about the efficiency ratio, Daryl and Kelly, do you have a target for this year and kind of how you are thinking about the revenue to expense relationship for 2015? I know you said that first quarter, Daryl, you've got some seasonal pressure on the efficiency ratio. How are you thinking about it in terms of goals for the full year? Kelly King : So, John I want to give you -- and I appreciate that is the first question, because I wanted to kind of address that philosophically. To be honest, last year we spent a lot of time and focus on efficiency ratio because we had the unusual situation where our expenses had popped up at the end of 2013 and there was lot of concern that our efficiency ratios will go on to 59, 60, whatever. And we knew that was not going to happen and so we set a target of in the 56 range for the year and we ended up making it. But as you know, it was a little up and down, and this is, as you just pointed out, it\u2019s a tricky ratio because you can manage your expenses more carefully than you can manage revenues, and revenues vary a lot and that impact from a denominator point of view really makes thedifference.  So we\u2019re not going to set an efficiency ratio for this year, because I just don\u2019t want to spend that much energy worrying about exactly whether it\u2019s 56 or 57 or 58.1. I mean it\u2019s just too much energy on that.  But what I would say to you having said that is, our intensity focus on expenses will remain to the extent that revenues grow more rapidly and that will put downward pressure on the efficiency ratio to the extent that it doesn\u2019t put upward pressure on it.  What we are going to be focused on is absolute level of expenses. So we think expenses this quarter can be roughly flat. We've got a little challenge covering that $72 million, all of them in pension expense, but we\u2019re going to target to try to cover that, and so that would argue that we would have a relatively attractive efficiency ratio. Long-term, we still have a target. I will say that in the 55 range, I don\u2019t think at this year, it could be at that level. But, certainly, better than the 59, 60 kind of level, but probably in the middle area, but I'm not going to give a particular number. John McDonald : Okay. And just a quick follow-up to that, I guess, the other side of relationship. Just in terms of -- on the revenue side, what are your expectations for the ability to grow net interest income this year? And Daryl, are those helpful on the first quarter outlook for the margin? How do you think about margin for the full year? Daryl Bible : So, John, if you look at net interest income, rates have fallen in the last three to four weeks. I would tell you that net interest income, we\u2019re planning for it to be up slightly on a year-over-year basis a lot of it is really determined by what happens by the Fed.  The Fed impact will impact us more than what we are seeing on the long end of the curve. As Kelly said, we are still expecting the Fed to increase middle of the year. And if Fed with their announcement in March takes the word patience out, you\u2019re going to see LIBOR rates start to increase in the second quarter, which you\u2019re going to see that starting to flow through into the net interest income in the second quarter just by LIBOR rates increasing. As far as margin for next quarter, we expect it be down about three to five basis points, couple of basis points on purchase accounting, maybe one or two basis points on core, but thereafter what we think a relatively stable margin, maybe margin actually going up a little bit for quarters two, three, and four. John McDonald : Okay, great. Thanks guys. Operator : And we will take our next question from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Kelly King : Hi Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Clarification question, just all the guidance is based on BB&T today, not including any acquisitions? Kelly King : Correct. Betsy Graseck : Okay, can we talk a little bit about how you are thinking about how the acquisitions will impact? Big picture, we can -- if you don\u2019t want to get too much more detailed on that and how you are expecting, it\u2019s likely to drive the overall company as they get integrated? Daryl Bible : Yeah. So the first acquisition will be Citi, and hopefully that will close at the end of this quarter. That acquisition will basically increase our core deposits. We really won't have any impact on the size of the company. We\u2019re just going to pay off national market purchases from that perspective, but we will add to run rate, because their cost of funds is actually lower than our cost of funds. So that should start to help.  The Bank of Kentucky, we plan for that to close in the second quarter. That will be a good transaction. On a size basis it\u2019s a couple of billion dollars. But you will start to see a little bit impact, positive there, just because our earnings assets, balance sheet growth is a couple of billion dollars. And they have a lot of good momentum going on there, good market in Greater Cincinnati, so that should actually be a really strong transaction over time. And then Susquehanna, we are expecting that to close some time in the third quarter, and as that closes in the third quarter you\u2019re going to see a nice lift in net interest income, fee income from that acquisition. And then expenses will start to fade away over the next year or so. So I don\u2019t want to get any more definitive than that. But that\u2019s kind of the timing that we are looking at. Betsy Graseck : And so then the improved funding mix, Daryl, that you talked about in the prepared remarks, is that in part a function of the Citi closing or what else is there that you are thinking about? Daryl Bible : If you just look at what's happened, what Kelly talked about early in our remarks, we are really growing our core deposits from DDA and our non-maturity deposits and it\u2019s just outpacing all of our rather funding. And what Kelly said was exactly right. We've doubled our percentage of DDA in the last five years funding our company and we still expect to have strong momentum there. I mean, all the investments that we've made in wealth and corporate banking is really paying dividends and our company is really becoming advantaged from a funding perspective. Kelly King : And Betsy, I would add that, depending on how it goes my personal prediction is that, as I said earlier, I think rates will start rising, as I said, in June, and as Daryl alluded to LIBOR going up in advance of that.  And then I think you\u2019re going to see institutions lagging in terms of deposit cost increase going up just because of the narrow spreads we\u2019re already operating under. And so if all that happens then that will bode well for net interest margins as we get through the year. Betsy Graseck : Sure. Got it. Okay, thank you. Kelly King : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Kelly and good morning, Daryl. Kelly King : Good morning. Daryl Bible : Hey, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Kelly, when we look at your ROE this quarter it came in strong a 130 basis points. And when you go back to the pre-recession periods, you guys regularly reported 140, 150, I think one year even 170 plus basis points return on assets. Now, I recognize the efficiency ratios are higher today than where you were back then. But when you look out over the next couple of years, what do you think BB&T could get to on an ROA basis? What's something that you think comfortably you guys can report in terms of profitability in an normal interest rate environment? Kelly King : Yeah. We spend a lot of time thinking about that Gerard. And obviously, you well know the ROA depends a lot on what's our level of equity is. But, we cannot think given the projected levels of equity we've talked about that ROAs will be in the range of 130 to 150 and that will probably kick out ROEs of 13 to 15. I think that\u2019s kind of the way it would go. It depends a little bit how the mix works out in terms of equity levels in any given short term period of time. But -- so, I think you get back to kind of where we were on ROAs, but that\u2019s because the relatively stronger equity. This could be a little challenging to back to the kind of ROEs we had, because we just got a lot more equity.  Now, that argues well for multiples in my view with regard to the stock, because you've got a less risky and more conservative and more resilient type of forward looking earnings theme. And so -- but I think for us and for the industry, you think about good ROAs, more like the old days that we remember so fondly and ROE being somewhat less, but still 13 to 15 with a low risk kind of company. Relative to the other alternative investments, I think it\u2019s pretty attractive. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you. And Daryl, you mentioned your LCR ratio was about 130% in the quarter, obviously well above where it needs to be. Will you guys think you will manage to on that ratio? How much lower will it go, if it will go lower? And when do you think you will get there? Daryl Bible : So, we are still learning about the LCR ratio. Our daily reporting starts to go live later this quarter, and we are just going to see try and see how -- what it is. Our best guess is right now that we want to manage about 20 points over what our threshold is. So we have to be at 90 by the end of -- next year and then 100 following year after that. So I think long-term we should be in the 120 range give or take. We actually are continuing to buy Tier 2 securities. It\u2019s just our funding mix continues to improve which is helping from a liquidity perspective, that\u2019s offsetting that. So we've shifted away from our Tier 1 securities and are buying more your Fannie and Freddie now. But it\u2019s just that our funding mix is also moving to positive direction for us. So that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t see it really move a whole lot this quarter. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Daryl Bible : Okay. Operator : And we will take our next question from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hi, good morning guys. Just one follow-up on the expense cycle, your general context of trying to keep expenses flattish this year. Can you just clarify, you are talking about trying to manage that on an operating basis, on the way you would ex those couple of big items you had mid-year. And does it also contemplate the pension up increase and also the run off of the FDIC add back? Daryl Bible : Yeah, all of Kelly comments really incorporated all the pension impact. We are talking about a flattish non-interest expense number on a GAAP basis. If you back out some of the two large items that we had in 2014, specifically the FHA charge and the Federal Home Loan Bank unwind, we\u2019re probably up maybe 2% at most on a year-over-year basis. Still able to be little bit under the revenue growth that we are forecasting. Ken Usdin : Understood. Kelly King : But that doesn\u2019t take away that we are still talking about flattish this year, Daryl just making there clarifying point that if you adjust to more normalized level 13, we would have there. What I'm trying to focus, Ken, is flattish kind of expenses for this year. Because -- in terms of the expense management all you can really do is focus on what's happening in terms of absolute level of expenses. And so if we can do that, even though it\u2019s on adjusted 2% kind of increase over the no adjusted lower level of 13, I feel really, really good about that for 14. Ken Usdin : Understood. And my follow-up is just -- can you just talk about a couple of a bigger fee categories and what you are outlook is? Notably insurance and investment banking? Kelly King : Let me let Chris give some color on that, because it\u2019s very positive story. Christopher Henson : Yeah, I think insurance, we finished this year -- year-over-year about 8% or so. And I think we do have the end of the year pricing is beginning to -- it really flattened out than the last quarter. So you will see pricing down a little bit. You should see as economy continues to improve, a bounce in exposure and just new business. And so we would expect to probably be up in the six or so range, I would say, for next year.  And in terms of investment banking, I would say in the 5% to 6% kind of range is well. We had really good equity activity at the end and we see M&A pretty active right now. So I think we have good continued opportunities as we look forward. Ken Usdin : Okay, got it. Thanks guys. Operator : And we will take our next question from Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Good morning. Kelly King : Good morning. Daryl Bible : Good morning. Erika Najarian : Some of the investors with whom I've spoken recently have a less optimistic view on the trajectory of rates than you all do and I do quite frankly. So, I guess, the question is that, given how stable the core margin has been and is predicted to be, can you grow core NII in 2015 even if the Fed doesn\u2019t move this year? Daryl Bible : So, when you look at interest rates Erika, we\u2019re -- about half of our assets are floating rate and the other half is fixed rate. The fixed rate portion of our assets for the most part reprice for the yield curve five years and end.  So I know lot of people focus on a 10-year, but the 10-year really just impacts more the mortgage market little bit in prepayments from that perspective. When we ran our models, we basically used current rates and what was in the forward curve and all that, and I will say that net interest income will be challenging to grow. But I still think depending how we grow our loans and our funding mix continues to improve. I think we still have a good chance of actually growing NII little bit. Erika Najarian : Got it. And just -- the second follow-up question is -- thank you for the comments on charge-offs for next quarter. I was just wondering as you think about an improving U.S. economy, is 40 to 45 basis points a good bogey for the rest of the year for BB&T? Clarke Starnes : Erika this is Clarke, I think it is. Keep in mind Daryl\u2019s comments. We do have a large -- relatively large contribution losses from our non-prime auto business which is really well run. But it -- is producing a core level losses. So, we\u2019re not going to go dramatically lower. So I think in that 40, 45 basis points range is probably a good number as we look forward for the year. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Mike Mayo of CLSA Investment Bank. Mike Mayo : Hi. Daryl Bible : Hello. Mike Mayo : My question relates to efficiency, and Kelly, I guess, if I could get you to commit a little bit your efficiency ratio in 2011-2012 was around 55% and for the last years 2013 and 2014 it was around 59%, including a 59% in 2014. So could you guys at least the efficiency ratio below that 59% given that the ratio was 57% or even 56.7% in the fourth quarter. So doesn\u2019t seem to be a too big of a bar. And related to that, when is -- you moved to SAP, you started to move little bit ago and what is your schedule for the conversion of the general ledger. I thought that was going to be some time in the first half of this year and could that help control your expenses? Kelly King : So, Mike, I think your -- see your logical deduction around the math is reasonable. All I'm trying to do math -- and Mike you know, you've been around business long time and I just don\u2019t like to have so much attention focused to one number, because obviously there are times when your efficiency ratio going up is improving EPS and return to your shareholders. So you don\u2019t want to get the market too polarized and focus on that. But that having been said, I think your logical deduction between we were 55, we got it to 59, somewhere in the middle is probably reasonable phase to be. So I think in terms -- and Daryl can comment. But I think with regard to project one we feel really good about where we are on that. We are in parallel. Everything is balanced to penny of a day. So it\u2019s working really well. We are working on fine-tuning the processing times to get the efficiencies and so we\u2019re trying to decide right now to be honest how we go live in mid-February or maybe mid-April. But that\u2019s not about the quality of system, it\u2019s just we want to get the efficiencies of the system running. So that to your second point, when this system gets running and just to be efficient then we will ratcheting down the expenses that are running to parallel all the system and then over the next 12 to 18 months we will get efficiencies that this system is really designed for, which is to be able to go out and extract information from cost system on a much more efficient basis. Now, it\u2019s lot of work to make that happen, but we know that there are lot of system improvements and design of how we extract information of those is going to make a system much more efficient as we go forward. Mike Mayo : Okay. And I guess, having asked a question about the core efficiency ratio, I guess, in the end we on the outside won't really know because can we unscramble the egg, you have an acquisition. Seems like you have Citi in the first quarter and Bank of Kentucky in the second and Susquehanna in the third, so at the end of the year we won't really be able to unscramble that egg, I guess.  So how can we monitor your progress on a core basis this year? Kelly King : Well, we will unscramble it for you as we go along, Mike as best as we can. As you know it is a scrambled egg. But as -- you know the Citi and the Bank of Kentucky won't have material impacts, the big change will be Susquehanna, which will be in the third quarter. And so we will build it, pretty clearly identify for you then what the run rate for BB&T will be for the rest of the year and we will be able to be pretty clear about what the Susquehanna numbers will be. So, I don't think it will be as confusing as it may appear at this point. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Kelly King : You bet. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott : Thanks. I've a question on the LCR. What would that 130% look like once you cross the $250 billion asset threshold from being A, modified LCR back to a full strength LCR back? Daryl Bible : So, we're running actually both numbers right now, Geoffrey, and for us right now, it's about 40 points. So, 130% LCR for us, under $250 billion. Once we cross over $250 billion would be 90 from that perspective. So, we're managing, we're monitoring that in case we ever did get over $250 billion in the next couple of years. So, we won't be surprised or caught off guard. It's -- we're actually doing the calculations and monitoring it today. Geoffrey Elliott : And what calculations you have done on the impact of crossing the $250 billion, the LCR dipping down to 90%. You want to run with 120. So, 30 percentage point of LCR build, what would that do to your profitability? Daryl Bible : It really depends on how you get over the $250 million, Geoffrey and where you are in the environment. The acquisitions that we have this year, both Citi, the Bank of Kentucky, and Susquehanna, all should improve our LCR because of the core finding that these institutions bring to our company and how we plan to basically put the balance sheets together. So, it's hard to say today, what the financial impact is. Obviously, it won't be a positive impact, but how negative it will be, it really depends on how you get there. And as we continue to grow and our core funding continues to strengthen and get stronger, we may not have much of an impact at all. It really depends right now. Geoffrey Elliott : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : And our next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Good morning. Kelly King : Good morning. Daryl Bible : Good morning. John Pancari : I want to give a little bit more color on your loan growth expectation for the full year of 2015. I know you give us the link quarter expectation and it does imply a good amount of acceleration. And I want to get your thoughts on what that could mean for the full year growth on an organic basis, excluding the impact of Susquehanna. Clarke Starnes : Yeah John, this is Clarke. We think roughly total 4.5% to 6% in that range, that's including mortgage. So, ex-mortgage, maybe more than 6% to 7% range. John Pancari : Okay. And then, just the drivers of that. What would you say are going to be the strongest contributors? Should it remains C&I and large corporate like we've seen, or do expect steady pick-up in some of the other areas including commercial real estate? Kelly King : As we talked a little bit about earlier, it will be pretty broad-based, which is why I feel very confident about over the course of the year and our large corporate is growing at 23% growth rate. That will continue at a very nice double-digit type of growth rate, I think, certainly for this year. Our retail is coming on really strong at 8.7%. That momentum will continue and maybe even build as we go through the year. Small business has been the challenge, but, to be honest, I think that's the bright spot for BB&T as we go forward, because the guest effect across Main Street America is likely to be very positive and that will cause more economic activity in the smaller credit area, which will really work to our advantage because we have a huge market share out in that space. And so when you look at overall loan growth, it's pretty diversified especially lending businesses, all of that will be very, very positive. So, we feel very confident. John Pancari : Okay. And then on new production loan yields, just want to give some color and where you're bringing on new money, at this point. Either overall book or if you have the detail by C&I versus anything real estate oriented? Clarke Starnes : Yeah. John, this is Clarke, again. As far as our C&I spreads, a little pressure this quarter, but relatively flat, about 178 basis points on new production on C&I on the spread basis. Our CRE income property, 258, and then our construction development, about 340. So, a little bit of pressure, but I think given where we're holding on our risk tolerances, they held up relatively well for the quarter. John Pancari : Okay. And my last thing is just around energy. Did you allocate any additional reserves over to energy? And do you have what the reserve is for the energy book as of the end of the year? Thanks. Clarke Starnes : We don't disclose that level of segmentation. But I can tell you we have a robust overall methodology for our allowance and certainly the energy segments included in that analysis and we do believe that, at this point in time, for what we know, we've allocated appropriate reserves for that book. I will tell you just to explain what Kelly said, we've done very thorough sensitivity analysis on our book down as low as $40, looking at coverage on proven producing reserves-only, realize that we have other collateral and liquidity sources other than that and we're going on a name-by-name basis. So, I feel good about where we are. We don't anticipate even as we look forward to next quarter. So, any material increases in our reserved related to the energy book beyond what we've already done. John Pancari : Okay. Thank you. Clarke Starnes : Sure. Operator : (Operator Instructions) And we'll take our next question from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities. Matthew Burnell : Good morning folks. Just -- Daryl, I wanted to ask you about the loss share amounts that are included in fee income with the exit of the commercial loss share agreement. Should we expect that number to move lower over the course of 2015? Is that, potentially, they help to your total non-interest income? Daryl Bible : Yes, Matt. I think that's accurate. This past quarter we had a negative $84 million in our loss share account and fee income line item. I would expect that to trend down probably in the $10 million to $15 million range every quarter over 2015, probably ending around $40 million to $50 million negative. So, that should be lift. And if you couple that with the change in the tax credit accounting, you're really going to see really strong fee income numbers for us next quarter. Matthew Burnell : Okay. And then just on the loan sales, you've done a couple of those. I'm presuming that the environment for those sales is a little bit better than you saw maybe earlier in 2014. Are you planning, at this point, further mortgage sales? And Daryl, your comment about the servicing efficiency that might occur from the loan sales, is that something might actually be visible in the operating expenses next year? Or is it, at this point, too relatively small to matter? Clarke Starnes : Yeah, Matt, on the first point, the market is still very liquid and the pricing is very attractive. And so, we were opportunistic and felt like it was a great risk trade-off given the pricing. And Daryl's point about the efficiency, just to give you some context, I think between the two sales there were over 2,000 loans or so. So, those would be TDRs and non-performer, so those are very servicing-intent. I do think, over time, you will see that bleed out into some improvement in the cost structure down in our service and operation and that's really why we're doing it. Matthew Burnell : Okay. Thanks very much. Clarke Starnes : Sure. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Eric Wasserstrom of Guggenheim Securities. Eric Wasserstrom : Thank very much. Thank. I'm sorry. Can you hear me okay? Kelly King : Yeah. Eric Wasserstrom : All right. Thanks. Sorry about that. I just wanted to follow-up without asking any specific point about your CCAR submission. Can you kind of help us kind of think through your stance on capital return over this CCAR cycle, given obviously what's going on with your acquisition activity? Kelly King : Yes. Eric, we've said pretty consistently that when we think in terms of capital deployment, we're always focused on organic growth, first, because that's the most efficient utilization of capital. Dividends are a clear number two for us, and strategic opportunities are number three and buybacks our number four. And so, I think as we think about 2015, we clearly are going to be asking for an increased total payout. We expect to ask for a modest increase in our dividend. And so, you would expect to see a request in the neighborhood of 6% kind of range. We'd still be low compared to a lot of folks, but we're still very conservative and we just don't want to -- we just don't want to get ourselves strained at all on capital because you never know when opportunities are going to come along. So, we'll be relatively conservative, but still that will be a nice increase relative to 2014. Daryl Bible : Yeah. The only thing I would add to that, Eric is that we also incorporate the acquisition into the [inaudible] and the acquisitions to use up capital. So, it's really the acquisitions plus the 60% total range that Kelly talked about. Eric Wasserstrom : Great. Thanks. And just to follow-up on a comment from earlier, Kelly, when you referred to the benefits of some of the technology implementation that you've done in terms of extracting information more efficiently and that kind of thing, where do we see that evidenced in the income statement? Is it in lower technology headcount or where do we actually see the benefits of that? Kelly King : So, where you will see it, it will be hard for you to see, to be honest, Eric, because it's enterprise-wide. So, think about it this way. Our current systems have to go out and extract information from like 83 different places to pull together information on a monthly and quarterly basis and doing our CCAR preparations. And today, frankly, an awful lot of that is very manually extracted. And so, this system eliminates a lot of the manual extraction. It's automatic computer-to-computer extraction of information. And so in every line of business, you will see less staffing requirements because all of these data have to come out on these various lines of business, so loans and deposits and other areas across the bank. So, it will be very widespread, very hard for you to see, but it would be very easy for us to see in terms of the aggregate processing cost and as sort of will be as I said, a downward indicator with regard to overall efficiency ratio. Eric Wasserstrom : Good. Thanks very much. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Kevin Barker of Compass Point Trading and Research. Kevin Barker : Good morning. Could you talk about the adjustment you made on the MSR given most of your peers have been marking down their MSR significantly this quarter? And you already have a relatively low discount rate and low CPR rate compared to most, and thinking about your MSR valuation. Daryl Bible : Kevin, this is Daryl. Every quarter we go through and we look at our MSR valuations. We compare it against a couple of other services and peer information. And our MSR valuation has been trending lower than the others for the last several quarters. It's at a point now where it's so far under that we had to rebalance it up and when we did that, we adjusted our prepayment models, and the prepayment model changes, basically was a positive to the valuation. We are still well under our survey peers. We use a PWC survey, we use FDIC survey and Mountain View are the services we use. And we're still significantly under those from an MSR servicing perspective. Kevin Barker : So, are you assuming prepay speeds below 9% at this point? Daryl Bible : Well, I mean the adjustment we made to get the $11 million increase was really in the prepayment models. But there's a lot of assumptions that go in to how you come up with the total valuation. It's hard to say exactly which assumptions make us lower than all these other surveys because they are an average of a lot of other services combined together. But I think we feel very comfortable that our valuations are adequate and on the conservative side. Kevin Barker : Okay. And then overall mortgage banking, are you saying this is one of your bigger opportunities in 2015? Daryl Bible : If you look at mortgage volume, since rates have come down, our application volume is up. It's hard to know how far this is going to play out, but it's definitely a positive bent for income. I mean you're seeing refis now approaching two-thirds of our business right now, which is positive spreads widening out. So, that could continue into the year, really depends on what happens with the longer end of the curve. But it's definitely a positive event from the mortgage perspective. Kevin Barker : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we have time for one final question, which we'll take from Paul Miller of FBR. Paul Miller : Thank you very much. On the origination side, I think you made a comment in your commentary about you're seeing good loan growth out of HELOC portfolios. We -- just from a couple of other banks that they're getting some decent growth out of HELOC portfolios especially in some of the hardest hit states like Florida and Georgia. Are you saying the same thing? Is that were most of the HELOC growth is coming from? Ricky Brown : This is Ricky Brown, Paul. We're seeing HELOC growth kind of broadly applied across our footprint. We've done some programs and it's enabled us to not only get notional increases, but we're actually getting some nice fundings in those lines as well. And we feel really good about where we're getting the growth. As I said, it's broadly across all of our markets. In addition, Kelly mentioned earlier, we have developed a good auto program at our branches. We're going to introduce a very good unsecured program that allows us to get some good yields. We're working on a boat program. We've got our QM [ph] lending in the branches redefined and we think that a nice uptick for 2015. And then of course, our partnership with wealth continues to be outstanding. Last year, we made 25,000 referrals are one of our community bank into the wealth area, which is very significant both from a deposit, fee income, and loan perspective. So, we see it pretty broad-based right now, which is good. Paul Miller : And can you talk about, a little bit, what's your average balances? Are they mostly line of credits, or are they somebody adding additional bedroom to the house? Ricky Brown : What we're seeing is the HELOC is obviously lines of credit, but people are using that money, they're using it for a variety of reasons from building onto their homes, to paying educational expenses, to refinancing credit card debt, whatever it might be. So, it's a wide variety. But these aren't huge lines. They are -- I don't know the exact average line size. But, it would be probably less than $50,000. Paul Miller : Okay. Guys thank you very much. Ricky Brown : You bet. Kelly King : Thanks Paul. Operator : And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Alan Greer for any additional or closing remarks. Alan Greer : Okay. Thank you, Kim. And we appreciate everyone joining us today. If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to call Investor Relations. Thank you and have a good day. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for joining us.",

Currently all participates in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Alan Greer of Investor Relations for BB&T Corporation. Please go ahead, sir. Alan Greer : Thank you, Amber, and good morning everyone. Thanks to all of our listeners for joining us today. We have with us today Kelly King, our Chairman & CEO, and Daryl Bible, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review the results for the first quarter of 2015 and give you some thoughts about the second quarter. We also have other members of our executive management team who are with us to participate in the Q&A session, Chris Henson, our Chief Operating Officer; Ricky Brown, the President of Community Banking; and Clarke Starnes, our Chief Risk Officer. We will be referencing a slide presentation during our comments today. A copy of the presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the BB&T Web site. Before we begin let me remind you that BB&T does not provide public earnings predictions or forecasts, however, there may be statements made during the course of this call that express Management's intentions, beliefs or expectations. BB&T's actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by those forward-looking statements. I refer you to the forward-looking statement warnings in our presentation and our SEC filings. In addition, please note that our presentation includes certain non-GAAP disclosures. Please refer to page two in the appendix of our presentation for the appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. With that, I will turn it over to Kelly. Kelly King : Thank you, Alan, good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us on our call. I hope you are enjoying a nice spring day. While this first quarter is seasonally a challenge for us, as most of you know, I believe it is a very clean and solid quarter. And while the environment is challenging, we are really well-positioned for the rest of the year and for the long-term. The reason I say that is because we are building a business which has a very strong diversified and resilient balance sheet. It produces steady revenue, less volatile earnings and we believe long term, less volatile steady growth in shell [ph] as well. Relative to the world, we are really excited about the future and will explain to you why as the course of the conversation. If you're following along on deck 3, our net income totaled $488 million in the first quarter. Diluted EPS was 67. We did have a penny in MRC charges so we would say core at 68. Revenues totaled 2.3 billion which was up 1.5% compared to the first quarter of 14. Had a strong performance in fee businesses and particularly in insurance where we had a record quarter. Our fee income ratio is up to a very strong 45.8% versus 43.6% in the first quarter of 14. ROA was 1.18%, ROE was 9.05%, and important our return on tangible common was 14%. With regard to loans which I'll give you a little bit more detail on in just a moment, excluding residential mortgage they did grow 5.4% which is pretty good in this environment. It was led by C&I, direct retail and sales finance. If you look at slide four, we'll give you \u2013 in just a moment I'll come to slide 4. Let me stay with slide three for just a moment. On some strategic points we did announce an agreement to significantly increase our partnership interest in AmRisc which is MGU underwriting risk, not taking risk, and to sell American Coastal to the AmRisc management team. This is a de-risking transaction, no material impact on results, and it does eliminate some exposure we had to hurricane exposure there, so we feel really good about that. Successful completion of the Texas branch acquisition, just to remind you, we did an earlier tranche of about 21 branches a few months ago. We just a few weeks ago closed 41 branches. Our combination of that is over $3 billion in deposits. It's a really good way for us to expand our franchise on a cost effective basis in Texas, and when we started in 2009, we were 53rd in market share, and this moves us up to 12 in market share. So we still have a long way to get to number five \u2013 or top five, but we have come along way. So we feel really good about that. I mentioned I was in Dallas twice in the last few weeks in a meeting with our people and some community leaders, and I will just tell you the positive momentum of our people in that market and in Houston and the other parts of Texas is really fantastic. We are being very well received the Texas, and we are very thankful for that. We did have a successful conversion of our general ledger system which was a big deal. And now we're looking forward to benefits of the efficiency and flexibility of that new system. We continue to move down the path that would evolve to the mergers for Bank of Kentucky and Susquehanna moving through the approval process, moving as expected. We expect Bank of Kentucky to close in the second quarter and Susquehanna in the last half, likely in the third quarter. Both are going very, very well. We have huge opportunities there. Ricky and I spent a lot of time at both of them, and we can give you more color in Q&A if you would like. But I will just say that both opportunity are fantastic and at it this point we feel more excited about them than we did the day we announced it. With regard to expenses it was a good quarter for us, non-interest expense was $1.4 billion. We did say in our guidance that we would have seasonally higher expenses which we always do. The first quarter includes $18 million increase in pension, a $22 million increase for payroll taxes. And so our efficiency ratio was 58.5%, but it's important if you x out these two items, the pension and the payroll, our GAAP expenses were lower this quarter. That's the overall kind of summary, Now I will take it to slide four with a little color with regard to the lending area. In the C&I area, growth was strong. Average C&I was up $1 billion which was 10.7% annualized. That was led by corporate, mortgage warehouse and government finance. C&I I would tell you is mostly in large participations, but that's what you would expect given that we are still fairly new in that whole space. And so we are able to get good participations in old names that just have been out there for a long time, and we just haven't been a part of the lending group. So that is working very well for us. I will that it is very competitive out there. Spreads are tight. We have done well in terms of its impact on our spreads, because we are still pretty picky, but it is tough out there. We do expect C&I to grow in the second quarter. It would be modest \u2013 a little bit slower though because we will have less growth in mortgage warehouse, but that depends on rates, but that's right now what we'd do. CRE in construction and development declined $38 million down 5.6% annualized. That was due to several large payoffs primarily. We are seeing growth in single-family construction and modest growth in office and retail. Multifamily was down, but here again we are being careful in multifamily. We think it is kind of peaking, and so we are being careful in underwriting and certainly in some markets we have really curtailed lending, because we think it is overheated. We do expect CMD to be seasonally stronger in the second quarter. CRE income producing was flat. We have some production in multifamily, hospitality and industrial but again offset by a lot of large payoffs. I think everybody knows with these extremely low protected interest rates there are a lot of actors out there looking for assets with any kind of yield, and so we and I think for everybody in the industry are seeing abnormally high runoffs which will of course separate when rates adjust, but for right now we are seeing that happening. The market we think in multifamily is improving, but again, we think it's kind of at the top. So it's not a problem today, but we just think we need to be careful where we're going. We expect income producing to be seasonally stronger in the second which will be good. Average direct retail was a strong quarter increased $106 million or 5% annualized. It continues to perform really well. I've got good volume in HELOCs, direct auto, made out of the branches. Our wealth production is still very strong, record production every month. It just keeps building, and we do expect the direct retail to grow at a faster pace in the second, maybe in the double-digit period. Average sales finance, which is again as a reminder largely prime auto order for us grew $251 million almost 10%. That was our normal production and some acquired portfolios. We expect it to be a little slow in the second, as we're being careful about tight underwriting. We mentioned last time that this is an area also in prime auto where there's a lot of money chasing these assets and spreads are getting to be really, really tight, so we are just not willing to take growth at unacceptable spreads. And so we can expect that to be a little slower in the second. Average residential mortgage was down $619 million or 8% annualized. This is consistent with our strategy of selling off essentially all of our conforming mortgages and the impact of last year's quarters sale of $142 million of mostly non-performing mortgage loans. That whole portfolio is performing exactly the way we want it to. In terms of production we had $4 billion versus $3.9 billion in the fourth. I will tell you the applications were up substantially in the last quarter, and that should flow through as we head through and into the last year, and the application flow was stronger than any quarter last year. Of course rates were way down, but we will see what happens with rates as we go forward. I am pleased that the gain on sale margins were up at 1.54% versus 1.18% for the last quarter, so we are improving our margins and still getting pretty good applications, so that is pretty good. We do expect to some decline of residential mortgage based on the strategy, though, even though applications and productions are good. Other lending subs were down $33 million or 1.2% annualized. This is as you know a seasonally slower quarter, but we did have strong performance in equipment finance, Regional Acceptance and Grandbridge. The second quarter will be seasonally stronger for Sheffield and afrokeso [ph], so we can expect probably double-digit growth in this category in the second quarter. So overall ex mortgage as I said grew 5.4%. We think that is very good. With regard to the second quarter we'd expect loans to grow 3% to 5%, but if you ex mortgage, we would expect a pretty strong 7% to 9% which is a little increase in our guidance with regard to loan activities, so our strategies of very, very diversified are working very, very well. If you look at slide five, with regard to deposits there is another very good quarter in deposit performance. Our non-interest bearing deposits grew $571 million or 5.9% annualized. Interest checking was very strong, $1.3 billion up 27% annualized. The accounts we really wanted to grown were up 8.7% which we feel really good about. So total deposits were down 2.4%, but again that's because we are managing our mix and our costs, and we will continue to do that. I really am very pleased to say that our non-interest bearing deposit mix was 30.6% the first quarter of 2015, up 200 basis points from 28.2% in the first quarter of 2014. So making a lot of progress in that area in terms of mix and our costs continues to come down, 0.25% in the first quarter versus 0.27% in the first quarter of 2014. So it was a solid quarter and positions us very well in terms of this protracted low interest-rate environment. And again we think we look good going forward even though this is a tough environment, because our non-bank businesses generally aren't feeling the same kind of spread pressure the community bank is, and our mergers provide excellent opportunities for efficiency improvement as we go forward. While the market is challenging we feel relatively bullish. Let me turn it to Daryl now for some color in some additional areas. Daryl Bible : Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. This morning I'm going to talk to you about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, non-interest expense, capital and our segment results. Continuing on slide six. As Kelly stated a few moments ago we are pleased to report a solid first quarter. Our performance includes outstanding results in credit quality. Net charge-offs were better than expected coming in at 34 basis points, down 13% and well below our long-term normalized range. Excluding Regional Acceptance, charge-offs were 18 basis points. Loans past due decreased a combined 20% showing continued improvement in almost every lending category. Going forward we expect net charge-offs to remain below 35 and 40 basis points in the second quarter assuming no material decline in the economy. NPAs declined 2% compared with the fourth quarter. NPLs declined 8%. NPAs as a percentage of total assets remain at the lowest levels since 2007 at 40 basis points. We expect NPAs to remain stable for the foreseeable future. Turning to slide seven, our allowance coverage continues to remain very strong to 3.6 times from 3.2 times net charge-offs last quarter, grew quarter provision of $99 million for the quarter compared to net charge-offs of $101 million. During the quarter, we completed a full review of our energy-related credit portfolio. The allowance includes an adjustment related to this review. Even with this, our criticized and classified ratios declined this quarter. Going forward we continue to anticipate no reserve releases. Continuing on slide eight. Net interest margin was 3.33% this quarter, down three basis points and well within our expectations. Core margin was 3.18%, down two basis points compared to the last quarter. The small decline in GAAP margin resulted from lower yields on new loans, runoff of acquired assets, offset by improved funding mix. Looking forward to the second quarter, we expect GAAP margin to decline six to eight basis points driven by lower interest rates and runoff of acquired assets. Core margin will likely be down a couple of basis points mainly due to lower yields on loans and increased competition. We expect net interest income to be flat next quarter. We became a bit more asset sensitive in the fourth quarter due to funding mix changes. This positions us to benefit when interest rates begin to rise. Turning to slide nine. Effective January 1, we adopted new accounting guidance related to qualified affordable housing investments. So you will see some reclassifications in 2014 related to this new guidance as well as a couple other immaterial reclassifications to conform more closely with industry practice. We had a strong quarter from our fee income producing businesses. Our fee income ratio came in at a very healthy 45.8% for the quarter. Total fee income was $1 billion for the quarter down $25 million compared to the last quarter. The change in fee income was driven primarily by a decrease in mortgage banking income, mostly due to lower net MSR income, a decrease in investment banking and brokerage fees driven by a decrease in capital markets activities and lower service charges on deposits due to fewer days and higher compensating deposit balances. We did however experience seasonal growth and employee benefits commissions resulting in a record quarter for our insurance business. For the second quarter, we expect growth in all major fee categories. Turning to slide 10. As expected, our non interest expenses were up due to seasonal factors. Personnel expense increased $36 million. This was mostly due to a $22 million increase in payroll taxes and an $18 million in pension expense offset by a slight decline in FTDs. In non-interest expense, loan related expense decreased mostly due to a $27 million charge in the fourth quarter. Other expense increased $42 million due to prior period benefits for franchise taxes and insurance related expenses. And professional expenses declined $14 million due to lower legal fees and costs associated with strategic projects. Looking at taxes, our effective tax rate was 30.6% for the fourth quarter and should remain at a very similar level in the second quarter. Looking forward we expect second-quarter expenses to increase 2% to 4% driven by annual merit in increases, production related incentives, professional and IT services expenses and the impact of the Texas branches and the Bank of Kentucky. We expect to achieve positive operating leverage in the second quarter. Turning to slide 11. Capital ratios remained very strong with common equity tier one capital at 10.5%. Fully phased in common equity capital was 10.3%. Looking at liquidity our LCR remains very strong at 130%, and our liquid asset buffer at the end of the quarter was very healthy at 13.7%. We were very pleased to receive a non-objection to our capital plan. Later this month we plan to increase the quarterly dividend by $0.03 per share to $0.27, a 12.5% increase. Additionally we are approved for share buybacks of up to $820 million beginning in the third quarter of this year. Our capital plan also included the Texas branch acquisition, the Bank of Kentucky, Susquehanna and the AmRisc deal. Looking briefly at our segments, on slide 12 the Community Bank's net income was down $41 million compared with last quarter due to seasonally lower revenues. The segment had very good loan production. Compared with the same period last year, commercial loan production was up 5%, and direct retail lending was up 50% due to an increase in home equity lines of credit. Additionally, Bancorp production increased 9%. Non-interest expense decreased 3.1% compared to like quarter. The Community Bank successfully converted the branches in Texas. Finally we are preparing for the upcoming acquisition of the Bank of Kentucky planned for the second quarter and Susquehanna for the second half of 2015. Turning to slide 13. Residential mortgage banking net income declined $18 million. This was driven by the runoff of the mortgage loan balances and lower production volumes sold offset by higher gain on sales spreads. On slide 14 dealer financial services had net income of $43 million, an increase of $9 million compared to last quarter driven by lower provision expenses and continued strong loan growth. Asset quality indicators for regional acceptance continued to perform very well within our risk appetite. Turning to slide 15, our specialized lending net income declined $7 million to $57 million compared to last quarter due to seasonally lower loan production. Like quarter loan growth was up 19% due to Grandbridge, Sheffield and Commercial Finance. On slide 16, insurance had a strong quarter with segment net income of $72 million up $7 million linked quarter. Revenues were up 3% for retail, 2% for wholesale and 3% in total. Additionally, insurance enjoyed strong like quarter new business growth of 32% for retail and 23% for wholesale. Regarding the transaction with AmRisc and American Coastal, we expect to have a $30 million $40 million merger-related charge next quarter. Remember that this transaction eliminates our exposure to underwriting risk and enhances an investment in a high-growth business. And lastly, on slide 17, the financial services segment experienced excellent linked quarter loan and deposit growth driven by corporate banking. Wealth also had record lending production, an increase of 39% compared to the fourth quarter. In summary, we had a strong performance in a seasonally challenged quarter driven by excellent credit quality, record insurance income and controlled expenses. We have great momentum going into the second quarter with a stronger outlook for loan growth and fee income. We are excited about our two upcoming bank acquisitions, the Bank of Kentucky and Susquehanna. Now let me turn it back over to Kelly for closing remarks and Q&A. Kelly King : Thank you, Daryl. So overall again I think it was a very solid quarter. Relative to the market we had really good loan performance, excellent deposit growth, good fee income, record quarter for insurance, expenses were lower exile [ph] seasonal in pension expense. Most importantly we are well-positioned for the rest of the year and going forward. Our non-bank businesses have really given us diversified income which is less volatile. Efficiencies in M&A are really going to begin to pay off for us. In this environment it's really about consistent strategies and excellent execution. That is what BB&T is good about. Alan\u2026 Alan Greer : Thank you, Kelly. Amber, at this time if you would come back on the line explain how are participants can call in and ask a question. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Morning. Kelly King : Morning. Erika Najarian : My first question, Kelly, is on your updated outlook on the rate environment. I remember last earnings call you were optimistic about potential fed actions this year and I think investors in the market are a little less so, if you could give us an update on how you think rates are going to trend for the rest of the year? and then Daryl, maybe as a follow-up to that, if rates don't go up in 2015, what the trajectory is for BB&T's core name, both on the stand alone BB&T basis and then overlaying Susquehanna? Kelly King : Erika, that is obviously the question of the day I think for every. So, I tell you what I personally think. I think the Fed is going to raise short-term rates in the June to September time frame in spite of all their rhetoric about the recent changes and so forth. The reason is because I think they believe they need to get started on moving off the zero-based level. The economy is not great, but it's not bad. They really need to begin getting to psychology for a movement in rates, because at some point you've got to get rates up so when you go down you have some cushion. Now, having said that, I don't think you can expect a quarter every time they meet. And so, it is going to be a quarter that kind of signal's that its started and I think they're going to be very cautious about their wording and maybe even they'll say give you a quarter and kind of take it back, you know? Don't spend thins come right back. My point is they will start the process. So, I don't think over the next year and a half or so you should expect a material change in rates even though there will be a change in the direction. That means the rate environment will still be challenging for us and everybody else. And so, you know, our plans in general are we keep hoping and it would be nice if rates went up a lot. We're not counting on that. We're planning on running our business assuming that the environment about like it is, and we think we've got strategies to enable us to do that. Daryl Bible : Erika, on your second part of your question, the guidance that we gave for margin, even though Kelly believes the rates are going up, we always use the forward curve when we model our projections. And we ran our models this month, we basically had no rate increases for 2015. It was really the month of December which basically had no impact for our company and margin. So, to answer your question, you know, I would expect our core margin to probably drop about three basis points in the second quarter. From that standpoint you are assuming we are able to get our loan growth targets projecting for the next several quarters we expect core margin to be flat. GAAP margin will probably be about 10 basis points higher than that for the next couple of quarters. As Susquehanna comes online in the second half of the year, that will improve our GAAP margin probably in the neighborhood of 10 to 15 basis points potentially and as that gets closer we will probably give a little bit more color by then. Erika Najarian : Great. Just my follow-up question, you have been open in terms of potential consolidation activity going forward and we've seen in some of the small and midsize peers in your footprint we are starting to see credit trends create even outside of energy and I guess the question year is do you think the willingness to sell or least the willingness to negotiate a more reasonable price is sort of the issues in credit \u2013 is that going to change the tone of your conversations in 2015? Kelly King : I think, Erika, everybody is experiencing the same environment Eric the interest rate you just alluded to has challenges in terms of technological costs going up a lot. Regulatory costs are going up, and you can't beat that environment by making poor quality loans and low priced loans. It is a very challenging environment. In to be honest, in this kind of environment it is a cost control game. You can't do so much in \u2013 that looks like adding scale. Do as much as you can organically but you can't push that because you might get scale and expenses but you lose it on net income as a provision. Our answer is mergers make more sense for us. I do believe to your point, Erika, others are beginning to see the same thing and I don't think that's a sign of witness for them. I think it's just a sign of scale advantages in a tough environment that's going to persist for some time. I expect the conversations to be more kind of practical and realistic about M&A going forward because I think everybody is settling into the recognition that is going to be a protracted tough environment. Erika Najarian : Thank you. Operator : We will go next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you, good morning guys. Kelly, can you share with us, you were talking about some of the lending areas where the competition is really intensified and more actors have come into play here. Is a non-bank competitors you are seeing more of for more just traditional depositories? Could you compare to the last time you saw this type of competition? Was at 06 or 05 for that time period? Kelly King : Gerard, you have been watching us a long time Mike I have. This time it is tougher and the reason is because there are more actors out there. What we've got going on globally is obviously an extended period of really low interest rates and what's that is doing is causing assets all around the world to be chased by a lot of money. The U.S. has relatively higher yields anywhere except in China. Money from everywhere is \u2013 higher-yielding assets in the U.S. ensure enough in private equity funds and hedge funds and business development corporations, all kinds of factors out there competing with us \u2013 this environment is tougher than it was before. Bank to bank competition first time versus last time, it is probably a little tougher \u2013 this kind of long-term extended \u2013 I think everybody is reacting to a really tough environment. I think some frankly of getting a little overzealous in terms of trying to chase \u2013 and taking a look bit more risk than they ought to. Everybody says everybody else does it and we don't do it so I'm not trying to be critical. I'm saying it is a tough environment and everybody is trying to do the best that they can do. At least for us we have said consistently we are not going to chase loan volume and expense for quality. 'S loan volume as I tell our board is extraordinarily good relative to the environment we are experiencing. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Too follow-up, you guys have obviously converted over to a single general ledger. Maybe Daryl can you share with us how much further do you have to go for updating your systems and second, how big of that acquisition could you do at the systems with the systems that you adjust implemented? What's the capacity of those systems? Daryl Bible : Gerard, the system we went to is an SAT general ledger system. It is a very proven ledger system and the industry. Not as much in the U.S., but around the world in Europe and other countries. I think this is very scalable and easily double our size and maybe much more. One of the large competitors in the U.S., one of the top four banks also just converted to this general ledger system and they are a trillion plus company so I think it is very scalable. Kelly King : Gerard, to prove that point, Chris and I about three weeks ago went to Australia in Sydney and Melbourne and visited three banks using SAP and we got extremely confirming feedback in terms of quality \u2013 we could certainly double easily our size with this foundation. Gerard Cassidy : Kelly, are you looking to expand your footprint into Australia? Kelly King : I really like Sydney, Gerard, but it might be a few years before we get there. Gerard Cassidy : Okay, thank you. Operator : We will go next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. A couple of questions. One was on the expenses, you know you called out where we are expecting to see them go, one of the reasons it was acquisitions. I was wondering if you could give us some color as to which are thinking there especially with Susquehanna \u2013 and maybe if you could speak to acquisition impact on revenues in the various lineups you called out? Daryl Bible : So for the acquisitions and the second-quarter impact, B etsy, if you take the 2-4% increase I would attribute 1.5% of that to city and the bank of Kentucky. It is real there and it is mainly in line items and personnel and occupancy are the main drivers for that category. As you get into third quarter, Susquehanna will have a much more significant impact. If you look at their expense base today it is about $500 million on an annualized basis. In the \u2013 days we have phased in going over 12 to 18 months so it's going to have an impact initial on our run rate. I think it will update that a little bit better next quarter as we get closer to that acquisition closing, but you can kind of look at Susquehanna's numbers they released yesterday and use that as a gauge and layer in expenses. We say we get a 32% \u2013 we think that is definitely doable over a 12 to 18 month period peak. Betsy Graseck : On the revenue side \u2013 you didn't call out the acquisitions impacting revenue so just wondering if it just wasn't as big of a benefit that you see in Q2 and more of it Q3 event or two hard to parse it out? Daryl Bible : The city deal is one that is in for the second quarter for the whole amount and that is basically there is not a real difference between the revenue expense pretty much matching each other. I think over time is where we get the accretion. The loan growth and the headcount growth over time, that is how we get that accretion and we have been very successful. We expect this went to be on track so that is how that will be accretive. For bank of Kentucky we do get a loan portfolio of about $1.3 billion that were going to get towards the second quarter and that will have an impact on the first quarter from a revenue perspective. Kelly King : Betsy, remember file there is a little bit of a lag time, in all three of these cases we think the light will be shorter than typical. The reason is because in all three cases we are entering very large markets with very, very low market shares, with more products, more services, our strategies are very effective in this kind of market. Rick and his team think that, and I totally agree, that will would be able to ramp up the revenue side of all three of these acquisitions very quickly relative to other traditional mergers. Betsy Graseck : To get some positive operating leverage in the second quarter, but it should accelerate from there as the revenues come through from these deals Daryl Bible : That's right. Kelly King : I think, you know, these deals close, Betsy, and as we achieve cost saves, you know, positive operating leverage for the next six to eight quarters should be very achievable. Betsy Graseck : Okay, thanks. Operator : We will go next to Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Matt Burnell : Good morning folks, thanks for taking my call. Daryl, maybe just a question if you can sort of on a BB&T standalone basis, with the general ledger system now up and running, is there much in the way of cost benefits that you're getting from that conversion, or are you still running sort of dual systems at this point and you don't expect to see much in the way of savings in the next few quarters? Daryl Bible : We converted over Presidents' Day weekend in February. We ever really decommissioned the old system, that is going to take place later this quarter or into the third quarter. I think that will phase in over time. I would say the efficiency of the system plays out as we continue to automate and improve our manual processes to automated processes. It's going to take time for that to happen. The real benefit of these systems is there is any efficiency play for automation but it's really the more you can attach to the systems so now we have basically a work horse general ledger system. The key now is to try to get all of our other systems onto this system to get more efficiency to scale rather than have lots of other ancillary of the systems that support and convert more to the SAP environment so we have better control and more efficiencies and more automation. So that will play out over probably the next two to three years. Matt Burnell : And maybe a question for Clarke, in terms of the delinquencies, those were down quite nicely both in an early-stage and 90 plus basis yet you were still suggesting no additional reserve releases going forward. How are you thinking about the trend in delinquencies and criticized assets going forward? Clarke Starnes : Great question, Matt, and I think our view is that we're operating more or less at or below normalized levels in a very benign current performance environment. While we feel really good about that and that's an opportunity to outperform and hopefully have a lower provision if our losses are lower, at the same time we are growing our loan book nicely, particularly in large corporate and other areas and we want to make sure we are properly and adequately reserved so that is why we said we don't believe it's appropriate right now to be releasing but we still feel good about the opportunity to outperform on credit in the near-term here. Matt Burnell : Thank you very much. Operator : And we will go next to John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Good morning. Back to the margin Outlook, on the core margin, what gives you confidence that the core margin flattens out in the third quarter excluding rates and excluding deals following the compression you do expect in the second quarter and the compression we saw this quarter? Daryl Bible : John, we have talked about this before over the last year or two. For us too have our core margin flattens out, we are really hoping and getting \u2013 loan categories. We need to get to the loan growth in our specialized businesses and our CRE businesses and those businesses to actually outgrow. But we are slowing their growth \u2013 lowest spread businesses. We are slowing the growth in prime auto which is also a slower spread business. As we slow that growth down and increase the growth in the others it is really the asset mix that is really what is driving the quarter stabilize. On the liability side there really isn't a whole lot of room to come down. That is really what we need to have happen for the core margin to stabilize. John Pancari : And I can happen without commercial real estate really picking up all that much because buyer tone \u2013 Daryl Bible : We believe it is so with the forecast we have. John Pancari : Okay. Thanks for the color on the margin trajectory. I am wondering what is your margin guidance particularly with the back half of 15? What does that imply in terms of your spreading \u2013 expectations? Daryl Bible : If you just look at the core bank, we would expect \u2013 income to start to rise as our loan growth kicks in. As bank of Kentucky basically comes in towards the end of the second quarter and have the full effect in the third quarter, that would also be a benefit there. As Susquehanna closes sometime hopefully in the third quarter, that would also have a huge benefit. But just all core basis by itself, we believe and are I will start to grow from second to third to fourth. John Pancari : Okay, all right. Lastly, Daryl, based upon your earlier answer around \u2013 mortgage abatement, is it fair to assume the declines \u2013 portfolio should continue here? Daryl Bible : Yeah, we have projections \u2013 it came down a lot this past quarter about 8% but that was driven partially by the loan sales as well as the refi and everything. I think the pace of it coming down will be slower the next couple of quarters that it should also shrink. So you will see a pretty good Delta between the core portfolio as well as the portfolio excluding mortgage. So I would expect it to continue to shrink not as much. John Pancari : Okay, thank you. Operator : We will go next to John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. John McDonald : Hi, good morning. I just wanted to see if there's any more precise estimate of the timing of the Susquehanna close, Daryl? In terms of our modeling, should we think about that you're open to close right at the beginning of the third quarter or is it just still very uncertain? Kelly King : John, this is Kelly. You know, this environment is a different environment than any other we have played in. In the old days you could predict with a lot of positioned exactly when things could occur. It's really not that predictable today. As I said in the opening remarks we have a lot of confidence that will close in the second half. In all honestly at think it will close in the third quarter but I can't be precise enough whether it is July or August, I just can't be that precise. John McDonald : Okay. Maybe, Daryl, you could help us think a little bit now, I know you said you would be more details later about the initial impacts in the first quarter when you do close that deal. Is it dilutive upfront before you get these saves? Just any sense of the timing of these saves and also the merger charges, how should we think about those as the first close the deal? Thanks. Daryl Bible : The merger charges obviously will be pretty heavy in the first quarter two when we close it. I would say from an earnings per share basis in the first quarter it's probably not that accretive Tom a maybe a penny or two. Early on it is getting the cost saves and getting the businesses to perform and getting the growth engines and getting all of our products and the people in Susquehanna trained. When Ricky does his magic with the community bank, that really plays out but it doesn't happen in the first quarter. It takes a year or two. John McDonald : Okay, but it could be accretive by a penny or two \u2013 even in the first quarter or two? Daryl Bible : It's possible, yes. John McDonald : Okay and then one follow-up question on deposit service charges. What did you see this quarter in terms of seasonality pressure on that line and how much are you seeing in maybe behavioral changes with folks managing their balance is better and having less overdraft and fewer deposit service charges? Ricky Brown : This is Ricky, I think you answer your question. Obviously seasonality \u2013 but balances increasing or offsetting analysis service charges so they are using balances to pay for service challenges instead of hard fees. Certainly overdraft behaviors are becoming more managed by our people. I think a lot of that is the \u2013 benefit they are getting. They are using this savings to not necessarily spend more but manage opportunities in their existing lives so that not over drafting as much. Those impacts together had the decline you saw in service charges. We are still seeing great deposit growth. Balances are continuing to increase. That momentum continues and that could continue to put some pressure on service charge income as those behaviors continue. Certainly want to continue to try to grow accounts and with the increase in accounts you get the potential for more service charges based on volumes \u2013 as we go into the second, third and fourth quarters of the year. John McDonald : Okay, thank you. Operator : We will go next to Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets. Paul Miller : Thank you very much. On the mortgage banking side, you talk about this segment the mortgage income was down to to lower servicing costs, \u2013 I'm a little confused about why was down wax. Daryl Bible : In the fourth quarter, we had a reevaluation in our MSR assets see take that revaluation away, I would say mortgage banking was essentially flat which is actually pretty good because usually the first is a weaker quarter. It is really set up to have a pretty strong second quarter after good start so we have pretty good momentum in mortgage revenue right now. Paul Miller : And secondly, a couple of your competitors are saying the purchase market especially in Florida is doing very, very w ell, probably better than most people but given the purchase world was a disappointment a couple of years ago, I'm just wondering if you could \u2013 at any color to that? Ricky Brown : Paul, this is Ricky again. Paul, \u2013 we spent a lot of time down there the early part of the year visiting our regions there and in every market, we are seeing very strong active purchase activities spanning be price ranges from low to high. Another thing we will see \u2013 would heard a lot about the weather in the Northeast causing people to say I'm coming to Florida and I'm going to be there. That impact is probably anecdotal but I think it shows you that Florida is back and people are again moving to Florida. They are buying homes \u2013 particularly in South Florida with \u2013 coming in buying condos. We see Florida just as you describe it, a much bigger more robust purchase market. Paul Miller : Thank you very much guys. Operator : We will go next to Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott : The context of assets you're looking at essentially buying, how do you think about the assets of the businesses, the GE capital selling \u2013 BB&T ? Kelly King : Jeff, we think the asset sales \u2013 are frankly going content in your especially \u2013 optimize the use of capital. We think that is a good thing for banks like us because as we talked about organic growth on a good quality basis is challenging so we're looking at everything that's available out there in the marketplace. Obviously we would be interested in any huge megadeals like Wells Fargo as has been talked about but we look at deals that make sense for us. We are fairly positive that some of those acquisition opportunities will come to fruition. Geoffrey Elliott : And then just shifting a little bit on expenses, I'm kind of curious in the divergence between personal expense up 6% year on year and full-time employees down 20%. I understand \u2013 with all of this, if you could just explain why those trends are so different? Kelly King : Besides pension, we had an increase on \u2013 quarter pension and seasonal factors but on a like quarter basis, it is mainly the \u2013 is the main increase or decrease. We also and strong insurance revenue which tends to payout higher incentives so it's probably Ward incented related and pension related. We maybe had an uptick probably in health expenses and flex benefits from that perspective that would probably be the other driver. Geoffrey Elliott : Thank you. Operator : We will go next to Nancy Bush with NAB research. Nancy Bush : Good morning. Two questions here. Could you expand a little bigger discussion of the am risk transaction? I think you said you significantly \u2013 and significantly increased your partnership interest at the same time the got rid of a lot of risk so assorted missing a piece here. Could you just explain that? And also if you could repeat the merger charges that will accompany that? Chris Henson : Nancy, this is Chris Henson. We owned a portion of am risk. Am risk is the underwriter that underwrites wind catastrophe coverage. That gets place with many underwriters throughout the world, one of which was our own America coastal which we owned 100% of. What they did was underwrite condominiums in the state of Florida. We took real underwriting risk in America coastal. Both of these businesses were started up back in the 2006-2007 timeframe. Am risk as a general underwriter \u2013 both have performed exceptionally well. \u2013 has risen to the third largest in the U.S. High margins and a very high growth business and we just thought prior to what I call sort sword of the New World being and underwriter might've been okay. Sort of in the world operate today \u2013 being in the underwriting business is probably not a place for us to be long-term. It might've been okay for our performance but probably not the best place for us. More importantly, and risk is really key to our franchise. If you think about it, we have the second largest wholesale \u2013 business in the country. What they really focus on is placing hard to place coverages. One Kigo to partner in this is am risk in this whole underwriting wind cap coverage. What am risk really brings us is higher-margin high-growth no risk of loss and it behaves within the wholesale segment as an underwriter almost because it's really about large underwriters outsourcing \u2013 so it is a bit of a hedge in the wholesale business. It is key to franchise long-term and we thought it made much more sense to increase our interest there. It is the same management team run the \u2013 the one that has been running America coastal. Kelly King : This is Kelly, \u2013 as Chris said we did the American coastal thing about nine or so years a go. We did it at a time if you recall that most of the underwriters had left Florida and we were doing Florida and we want to show market support so without there was an opportunity to provide a bit of capital in that market and we have these really good underwriters in am risk that new that market extremely well but we only put $50 million in it. \u2013 we actually made a lot over the last seven or eight years and we frankly redeployed that into the \u2013 unit Chris described. We made some good money and decided not to be grieving took it off the table and we put it into the core part of our business that does not take risks.. Clarke Starnes : I would think other really as a trade. \u2013 into more of a broker. Nancy Bush : Okay, so are you a minority partner in am risk, if I could get you to discuss your partnership interest? Kelly King : Absolutely. We are majority holder of am risk, a clear majority. I call it a significant partnership interest. In terms that you ask about the balance sheets, we really experienced again on the transaction. It is just from a goodwill impairment perspective, we have to look at it from the context of the entire wholesale segment. When you take that into account we had a small impairment. Nancy Bush : But I think Daryl had said something, can you tell me what you said the charge was going to be in the second quarter? Daryl Bible : The goodwill impairment is probably going to be between \u2013 call it $35 million give or take. Kelly King : And it's all good well. Unidentified Analyst : It's a non-cash charge. Kelly King : No, we had a positive economic gain because the overall proportion of that business in the overall insurance business. We have 90% ownership in am risk and that is a really good position for us because it is a very good business. Nancy Bush : Okay. My follow-up question, I think you cited a 1.5 per% gain on sale and the mortgage business is quarter. That's a bit behind some of your competitors which I think are reporting in excess of 2% gain on sales. Is a mixed issue for you guys? What do you expect that 1.5% to go in the second quarter? Daryl Bible : It is really a mixed issue. If you look at the pieces, retail spread was 3.62 and correspondence spreads were 36. Correspondence was about two thirds of the business which is really why it was down lower. We expect going in this next quarter to have stronger purchase activity and stronger retail so it should move into the other direction this next quarter. Nancy Bush : Thank you. Operator : We will go next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Good morning guys. You alluded a little bit to the Ricky Brown magic in retail but I'm \u2013 on the Susquehanna side. You mentioned 10 to 15 basis points a potential increased to the \u2013 post- close. They had a \u2013 when I look at the numbers. I know you're going to give us more detail later on but can you help us understand what you were saying that would be incrementally beneficial because that implies maybe a four-port 5% \u2013 is it residual lease accounting or just where rates are relative to announcement? Any color there would be helpful. Thanks. Daryl Bible : Typically what we do an acquisition \u2013 what we always do is we basically taken all the client activity so we taken the client owns inclined deposits. We were very hard to X out any non- claim borrowings \u2013 and other opportunities there. And in the investment portfolio decision is really a decision on whether we need they liquidity or not. If you don't need securities or liquidity and also helps razor margin. There are a lot of things you were to optimize the overall piece so it fits into your total organization but we will give you more color next quarter on that. Ken Usdin : I guess if that math is right the type of earnings accretion you could get relative to that 3% indicated could be decently larger? Daryl Bible : It's going to be off a smaller base because you have smaller earning assets\u2026 Ken Usdin : That's a fair point. Okay. Secondly on the insurance business. You guys have been talking about 6% \u2013 organic growth and you had some \u2013 I was wondering if you could just elaborate, there were some changes in the seasonality. Could you talk about this organic opportunity and if we should see a better year over year trajectory from your? Chris Henson : It's Chris again. If you look on a same-store sales basis it would be about 3% quarter over quarter kind of common view. What we expect is a better second quarter than we had first. Generally this is busy the second quarter is going to be the strongest followed by the first followed by the fourth and the third. What you are referring to is most of the EB business as Daryl alluded to earlier hits in the first quarter. We still believe to the balance of the year we're going to have enough strength out of the business to \u2013 five to 6% core growth year over year. So we feel very good about that. What you're seeing right now because we haven't had large loss periods, the retail businesses are sore \u2013 we are seeing very strong strength in the retail business. As Kelly alluded to, retails new retailers new business growth was 32%, wholesale was 23. The new business growth was about 26%. Ken Usdin : Okay, thanks guys. Operator : We will go next to Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim securities. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much. Just a couple of questions. Versus the foreclosure inventory on the legacy portfolio, excluding the FDIC sales, it's the members but it's ticked up pretty consistently over the past few quarters. Can you indicate what's driving that trend? Clarke Starnes : Eric, this is Clarke. That is mostly in our prejudicial mortgage in some of the \u2013 and getting the foreclosure is done and also we had some delays and closings frankly in the first quarter because of the weather but we feel really good but we look out on the pipeline. I believe you will see that stabilize to strike him down a bit so were not concerned about it. It's mostly working for residential stuff but we feel good about it. Eric Wasserstrom : Great, thank you. And/or brokerage commissions line item was down a bit in the period which is a little bit different from peers. Were using just a different trend activity than the broader markets? Daryl Bible : We just had really strong equity deals in the fourth-quarter that in fact strongest in our history. We had the biggest \u2013 so we are just bouncing back from that. If you look at the core business it is still doing very well. \u2013 the retail broker commissions have grown about 9% so it's really nothing more and we have a strong fourth-quarter. Eric Wasserstrom : Got it. Lastly, as I think about your common equity Tier 1, it seems like there are several puts and takes. There is an issue is coming and also some buyback on the numerator and the denominator you've got assets coming on potentially some relating as those assets move to the fully phased-in basis which may be Susquehanna is it may be doing today and all that kind of thing. Net of all of that, which be our expectation about your resulting common equity tier one add year and your and versus where it is today? Is that higher or lower? Daryl Bible : For the \u2013 if you looked look at the dividend request that we had and the buyback and the four acquisitions we had embedded in there, we have well over 100% use of our retained earnings over this five quarter period. So if you look at our common equity tier one call it 10 and a half now transition basis it's probably going to end up a little better 10, call it 9.8 give or take 10 basis points so we'll probably going to use 60 basis points of capital over the next five quarters. Eric Wasserstrom : Excellent, thanks very much. Operator : We'll go next to Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks Marty Mosby : Daryl, I went to ask you a little bit more and maybe even challenge on the sale of the mortgage residential and running that portfolio down. If you look, the use our three to 3.5% on new originations and if you get rid of that the only thing you can put it into is securities. Kelly didn't think rates were going up that quickly so I'm just curious what's driving the overall thought process here? Daryl Bible : I know Marty you are an old CFO finance guys so you understand all this stuff, but if you look our match funded basis and you look at these assets, these assets have a credit spread we are putting on the books well north of 100 basis points if you actually try to fund these assets call it 80 basis points. The negative complexity you have an rates eventually do go up these assets will really start to extend out and it's just a really tough asset to fund properly over the long term. I think selling as much as we can out and getting the revenue that we can is the right thing for our company right now. All about overload businesses are growing really well. We are growing even with this running off so I think that's positive. We are stabilizing core margin with basically flat interest rates which is really pretty good in this environment. Kelly King : Marty, you have to keep in mind, our primary driver in this is diversification. Even if it's \u2013 were just not \u2013 not consistent with our long-term diversification strategy. We wanted to bring it down some. It's not dramatic but we wanted to bring it down some to get it in line with our justification plan. Marty Mosby : Daryl, just pulling that altogether, what you are substituting out is the extension risk for shorter securities which is that is really what is making more asset sensitive so when you're looking at that each quarter, asset sensitivity getting a little bit stronger, is that what is driving that needle there? Daryl Bible : Is one part of it but the other piece is really the unbelievable strong growth we have gotten in core deposits. Core deposits, they are strong for the industry. Our core deposits growth and community bank and corporate banking has been phenomenal. If you go back six or seven years ago, the percentage of DDA to our funding was in the midteens. We are now over 30% DDA funded. That is just a completely different BB&T. Marty Mosby : And then just lastly, Kelly, you talked a lot about the pricing pressure on loans. As we do see rates starting to move up slowly, can you envision with all the liquidity which is driving like you were saying be chasing of assets maybe being the opposite and allowing a little bit more room once you get some relief with rates moving even modestly higher to be up to re-create some deposit spreads? Kelly King : Absolutely. I think that's an area that will create the training of the deposits in the system. I think it will create an opportunity for this asset investors to \u2013 and all of that will create asset pricing increase with the banking segment. Marty Mosby : What about deposit spreads? Kelly King : The deposit spreads \u2013 but I personally think is \u2013 simply because we have given up a lot of deposit you are things like NSF's and other actors over the last two or three years. I think all of that will be Incorporated into decision-making which will cause a lag on the deposit pricing as we go up. Marty Mosby : Thanks. Operator : We will go next to Chris Distacio with KBW. Chris Distacio : Good morning Kelly and Daryl, how are you? Kelly King : Good morning. Chris Distacio : Most of my questions have been answered but I wanted to go over the accounting change in the quarter. That improves are operating leverage overnight, correct? \u2013 the offset is not an expense \u2013 Daryl Bible : That's correct. We basically move a negative income item out inputted in the \u2013 item. We also restated 2014 financials so if you go back and compare numbers versus last quarter you're going to see the 2014 change. This is proportional accounting we had to do for our tax credit businesses. Chris Distacio : Okay, I appreciate the color on page 18 of the supplement in terms of what it would have been in the past. If I were to average those numbers both on the other income impact and the tax impact that would be roughly the same for the quarter? In other words you would've benefited from the change \u2013 injured taxes would've been up by about $40 million on the accounting change? Daryl Bible : That's right, Chris. Operator : That concludes today's question and answer session. I would turn the conference back over to Alan Greer for additional or closing remarks. Alan Greer : Thanks, Amber. Thanks would joining us today. This concludes our call.",

So, we had a really solid quarter frankly with excellent start, [ph] strategic results, revenues were up linked and like quarters, and I might add in a relatively tough revenue environment, excellent credit quality, capital and liquidity, so overall a very solid quarter. Net income was $454 million in the second quarter; diluted EPS totaled $0.62 but if you exclude the non-cash loss on American Coastal and merger related charges, it was $0.69. Fee income ratio continued to improve to a very nice level of 46.3% versus 45.8% in the first quarter \u201815 and if you ex the American Coastal non-cash loss and the AmRisc, [ph] our ROA 1.17 ROE was 9.06 and importantly our return on tangible common equity is 14.05. From revenue point of view, we were very pleased. Our revenue totaled $2.4 billion up $23 million or 3.9% annualized; revenue increased 1.3% versus second quarter of \u201814, kind of lot of fee income positive is particularly in mortgage banking and investment banking. Our fee income ratio continued to be strong, as I said and we think that is a continuing positive for our company. In the lending area, our average loans grew 3.9% versus first quarter but if you exclude our planned residential mortgage run off, it was 7.8%, which was very good in this environment. That area was led by C&I, Direct Retail, Sheffield and Regional Acceptance. As I said, we had some very strong strategic developments during the quarter. We did complete the sale of American Coastal and significantly increased our ownership in AmRisc but it basically, in concept it eliminates the small underwriting risk that we had in American Coastal. We reinvested that in AmRisc which increases our ownership in a really solid fee-income business, so some net real positive from a quality point of view. We successfully closed and converted the Bank of Kentucky on June 19th. It\u2019s going great. I was out there last week for a visit with the groups and a whole day with them, had breakfast with a group of tellers and associates. And they were very excited to have meeting with the senior leadership team and then had a meeting with all of their officers and Board members. And I\u2019ll say, although very early, it\u2019s off to an extremely positive start and Northern Kentucky, Greater Cincinnati market is really fantastic for us. Very excited about the fact we\u2019ve got approval for Susquehanna with a planned August 1st acquisition and a conversion later in the fourth quarter. This whole process is going very- very smoothly. The receptivity in the markets has been great. I was up in Lancaster last week, Susquehanna was a key sponsor in the LPGA, a golf tournament and so had a chance to meet a lot of clients, a lot of associates and attitudes were extremely positive. This is a great company. You may have noticed, they got number one in client service quality by J.D. Power in the Mid-Atlantic region recently. By the way BB&T was the best, number one of large banks in that period. It\u2019s a huge opportunity for us in really good markets. These markets are a lot like a rest of our footprint, kind of a combination of some good solid rural and mid part of the state, good medium sized cities just like we\u2019ve always operated in, excellent large market in Philadelphia, excellent wealth opportunity, really strong core banking opportunity. So, it\u2019s going be really, really good for us. And don\u2019t forget, this is a really big scale opportunity for us with regard to expenses. If you are following along on the deck, look at slide four. We always like to point out a few selected items that affect earnings. So, we did have a positive income tax adjustment of $0.15 on an after-tax basis. So we did extinguish about a $1 billion of federal home loan bank debt, which had $0.15 negative EPS impact. So they are just kind of washed out. We did have a non-cash loss on sale of American Coastal of $0.05 and we had $0.02 in merger-related restructuring charges. So, the way I look at it that was about $0.07 negative impact to recurring earnings. If you follow along on slide five, I\u2019ll give you a little more commentary with regard to the lending business. Our C&I loan growth was very strong. Average C&I loans were up $1.1 billion or 10.6% annualized. We had strong growth in corporate lending, mortgage warehouse lending and government finance. I will tell you, the C&I lending is currently mostly in larger participations and it\u2019s very competitive, so spreads are very tight, although I\u2019m proud of the fact that our spreads were basically flat compared to the first quarter, which is a big achievement given the environment. We do currently expect C&I to continue to grow in the low double-digit range in the second quarter if you exclude our pending acquisition of Susquehanna and after you\u2019d include Susquehanna, C&I will likely see 30% annualized. CRE in the construction and development area increased $33 million or about 4.8% annualized and the period balances were up more than $200 million but about 40% of that was from acquisition of Bank of Kentucky. Organic growth was strong based on a very positive change and then we had a material decrease in pay-off activity that we saw last quarter. We are seeing strong growth in fundings of multifamily construction and hospitality projects. Spreads on C&I lending in this case actually improved during the second quarter and our expectation is that C&I growth to be a bit stronger in the third quarter. CRE income producing increased $50 million or 1.9%. This was strong growth in industrial, retail property segments. And the period balance was up almost $400 million but most of that most due to the Bank of Kentucky. Market fundamentals generally continue to improve. This is a really good market now. Spreads continue to tighten but on a net adjusted basis, risk adjusted basis, they\u2019re still very solid. So, looking next quarter, we expect C&I TP [ph] to show strong growth due to continued organic success and the impact of full quarter of Bank of Kentucky and remember, we\u2019ll have a partial quarter of Susquehanna. If you look at average direct retail lending, it\u2019s a really, really strong story for us. A lot of work has been done on that last year and a half and it\u2019s really beginning to pay-off. We\u2019ve increased $258 million, almost 13% annualized, primarily due to HELOCs and direct auto lending in the branches. This is the sea change from the last 25 or 30 years, they are really beginning to make a lot of good auto loans in the branches, which is outstanding. Wealth\u2019s contribution to the direct retail lending continued here at record levels on market [ph] basis, really good production from the community banks. So, the wealth strategy just continues to be an outstanding success, which continued to have significant momentum in direct retail lending in the third quarter and we expect direct retail to grow at a faster pace, part of that\u2019s due to full quarter impact of Bank of Kentucky but most of that strategy is really working. And average sales finance, which is largely prime auto lending for us, we grew modestly in the second quarter slow and significantly from the first quarter. We\u2019re trying to be really careful with regard to frankly pricing in that market is extraordinarily competitive and the prime space, spreads are really, really thin. It\u2019s our lowest yielding asset. And we\u2019re really just kind of turning it back in terms of our volume expectations. So unless the spread opportunities change, you would expect to see that decline for us. But on the risk adjusted, capital adjusted basis that\u2019s a net positive change. Average residential mortgage loans were down $565 million, 7.4%. Remember this is our plan of letting that run-off because we\u2019re essentially selling all conforming production. Our positive retail originations into the quarter were 5.5 billion, up from 4 billion in the first quarter. They were modestly versus last quarter, but stronger than the second quarter of last year. Gain on sales declined due to slight -- our correspondent channel mix. So looking ahead, we continue to expect contraction in our resi portfolio; we hope to continue that strategy and we think we will for some period of time. So in the third quarter, absent the impact of Susquehanna, that will continue to decline. If you include Susquehanna the residential mortgage will likely grow. But remember, that\u2019s not a change strategy, that\u2019s just bringing on the Susquehanna balances. And other lending subsidiaries grew $383 million or 13.6%. This was a strong seasonal quarter for us. Strongest components were Sheffield, Grandbridge, AFCO/CAFO, it\u2019s called our insurance premium finance business and Regional Acceptance. Third quarter also reasonably strong; that will drop-off some in the fourth quarter, but we do expect third quarter to have double-digit growth in this category. So to sum up, we expect average total loans from investments held to be an annualized 3% to 5% in the third quarter on organic basis; excluding residential mortgage, we expect it to be 6% to 8%. Obviously if you include all the deals, we\u2019ll have growth that will be probably in the 30% range. And we would expect at the end of the third quarter, end of period loans to be $135 billion. So, if you will turn to the next slide, we\u2019ll give you just a little bit of commentary with regard to deposits. That story just continues to be outstanding, excellent deposit growth, really continued to improve deposit mix. Overall, our non-interest bearing DDA grew 18.2%; if you exclude acquisitions, it\u2019s still a very strong 13.7%. Personal, business and public funds all grew 12.8%, 15.3%, 8.8% respectively versus second quarter \u201814. DDA deposit mix was the strong 31.5% versus 28.3% in the second quarter \u201814. And our cost of interest-bearing deposits continues to come down steadily to 0.24%. So, we made excellent progress over last couple of years in that area. So it\u2019s a solid quarter, as you can see. We\u2019re very excited about the growth opportunities and the efficiency gains that we\u2019re going to experience heading into the next year. Before I turn it to Daryl, I just want to emphasize, we are really focused on efficiencies. The market is good; we think it\u2019s growing at a solid 2 to 2.5 growth rate which is better than most of the world, but it\u2019s not a really robust growth rate. And so, we believe in that environment that experienced management continues to be extremely important. We have laser focus on organic expense management and we will absolutely gain efficiencies and expense management through the combination of Bank of Kentucky and Susquehanna. Let me turn it to Daryl now to give you some more color on some other areas. Daryl Bible : Thank you, Kelly and good morning everyone. This morning I am going to talk about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, non-interest expense, capital, our segment results, and the impact of acquisitions on our results continuing on slide seven. As Kelly said a few moments ago, we are very pleased to report a solid second quarter. Credit quality was excellent; net charge-offs were 33 basis points, down 3%, bit better than we expected. Excluding Regional Acceptance, net charge-offs were only 20 basis points. Loans past due increased 4% due to seasonality in Regional Acceptance. Going forward, we expect net charge-offs including Susquehanna to be between 35 and 45 basis points in the third quarter, assuming no material decline in the economy. NPAs declined 5% and commercial NPLs declined 12% from last quarter. We expect NPA levels to remain stable including acquisitions. Turning to slide eight, our allowance coverage remains very strong, increasing to 3.7 times from 3.6 times net charge-offs last quarter. The allowance includes the impact from the recent SNC exam. [Ph] We recorded a provision of 97 million for the quarter compared to net charge-offs of 98 million. Going forward, our provision will likely be driven by actual losses incurred and loan growth. We currently expect third quarter for provision to increase 15 million to 30 million to allow for the impact of the acquired portfolios and retail loan seasonality. The fourth quarter provision is expected to be 25 million to 40 million greater than the second quarter. Continuing on slide nine. Net interest margin was 3.27%, down 6 basis points and within guidance we provided you, last quarter. The decline resulted from runoff of acquired assets and lower yields on new loans and securities, offset by funding mix improvement. Core margin was 3.16, down 2 basis points. Looking forward, including Susquehanna, we expect GAAP margin to increase about 4 to 6 basis points in both third and fourth quarters, resulting in a GAAP margin in the mid 3.30s by year-end. We expect core margin to remain relatively flat in the third and fourth quarters unless interest rates start to rise. Looking at our sensitivity table, we became slightly less asset sensitive in the second quarter, mostly due to the Federal Home Loan Bank terminations and investment and deposits funding mix changes. However, we will definitely benefit when the Fed starts to raise interest rates. Turning to slide 10, our fee income producing businesses had a strong quarter. With fee income ratio increasing to 46.3%, total fee income was $1 billion, up $22 million compared to last quarter. The change in fee income was mostly driven by these factors : First, mortgage banking increased $20 million, mostly reflecting higher net MSR related income and higher commercial mortgage volume. Second, investment banking and brokerage fees increased $14 million, mostly driven by higher capital markets activity. This growth was offset by $18 million decline in insurance income mostly due to the sale of American Coastal and a seasonal decline in employee benefit related revenues. Finally, other income decreased $25 million due to the loss on sale of American Coastal. Looking forward, we will have a seasonal decline in insurance revenues in the third quarter, plus softer mortgage revenue. We will gain a partial quarter benefit of $25 million to $30 million from Susquehanna. But overall, fee income for the third quarter is expected to be flat to down 2%. In the fourth quarter, fee income is expected to increase 3% to 5% both versus second quarter. Turning to slide 11. Non-interest expenses increased consistent with our guidance. Personnel expense increased due to higher production related incentives, acquisitions, annual merit increases and higher equity-based compensation for retirement eligible associates. FTEs were up 489, mostly due to acquisitions. Excluding the loss on debt restructuring and merger charges, expenses were up $47 million, driven by personnel related costs, which include new Texas and Kentucky branches. Looking at Texas, our effective tax rate was 13.8%, due to the STARS recovery. The adjusted tax rate was 32.2%. Going forward, we expect our effective tax rate to be around 30%. Excluding the loss on debt restructure and merger charges, we expect non-interest expense to increase 3% to 5% due to the upcoming Susquehanna acquisition. In the fourth quarter, we expect 6% to 8% increase versus second quarter in non-interest expense due to the full quarter impact of Susquehanna. Excluding merger related costs, our fourth quarter core expenses are expected to be approximately 1,550 million. We also expect 60 million to 80 million in merger charges for both third and fourth quarters. We are very confident we will improve our efficiency and reduce these expenses. We are already on our way to achieve our targeted savings for Susquehanna by the end of 2016. At least 32% of their expense based will be driven out of the run rate. Turning to slide 12 capital ratios remain very strong with Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital at 10.4%. Bank of Kentucky and AmRisc transactions use 18 basis points of our common equity Tier 1 capital. Looking at liquidity, our LCR declined to 118% due to increases in interest rates affecting mark to market on securities, non-operating deposits at wholesale funding. Our LCR was well above the minimum required 90% which starts in 2016 and our liquid asset buffer at the end of the quarter was strong at 13.3%. Looking briefly at our segments, starting on slide 13. Community bank\u2019s net income was up $24 million from last quarter, driven by deposit growth and higher funding spreads on deposits, partially offset by lower interest rates on new loans. Loan production was very good, commercial was up 10%; direct retail was up 35% and revolving credit was up 22%. The conversion of Bank of Kentucky was a big success and we are preparing for third quarter closing and fourth quarter conversion of Susquehanna. Turning to slide 14. Residential mortgage net income totaled $72 million, up $8 million from the first quarter. This is driven by higher loan production and an increase in net MSR income. And credit quality continues to remain strong. Turning to slide 15. Dealer financial services continues to generate strong loan growth with average loans up 6% for dealer finance excluding wholesale and 10% for regional acceptance. Dealer finance launched a flat-fee dealer compensation program on July 1st. This approach eliminates pricing discretion in a consumer transaction. Asset quality indicators for dealer finance and regional acceptance continue to perform well within our risk appetite. Regional Acceptance opened a new office in Kansas City and additional office in Northern Virginia is planned for later this year. Turning to slide 16. Specialized lending net income totaled $70 million up $13 million from last quarter. Drivers include strong loan production for commercial mortgage income, solid loan growth in small ticket and consumer loans from Sheffield, and strong production from mortgage warehouse. Credit metrics remain strong with charge-offs at 16 basis points. Moving to slide 17. Insurance services net income total $53 million down $19 million from last quarter, mostly driven by a seasonal decrease in employing benefit insurance commissions and the sale of America Coastal. Year to date new business growth was very healthy at 14% for retail and 17% for wholesale. Same-store sales achieved growth of 2%. As a reminder, the AmRisc transaction eliminates our exposure to underwriting risk and enhances our investment in high growth business. Insurance services acquired NAPCO, a wholesale broker with commercial property catastrophe insurance coverage. On slide 18, since last quarter financial services generated significant corporate loan growth of 17% and wealth experienced 13% loan growth. June was a record month for wealth lending in both, dollars as well as units. And corporate banking\u2019s average deposits grew 38% on an annualized basis. Turning to slide 19. Let me recap the impact of our acquisitions. Including Susquehanna, we expect total loans of approximately $135 billion and securities of approximately $43 billion at the end of the quarter. In terms of credit, we expect third quarter provision increase of $15 million to $30 million and a fourth quarter provision increase of $25 million to $40 million. These estimates are both compared to this quarter and depend on loan losses and loan growth. We will update these numbers post acquisition at our next investor conference. Looking at net interest margin, we expect Susquehanna to result in an increase in GAAP margin of about 4 to 6 basis points in both third and fourth quarters. Fee income is expected to be flat to down 2% in the third quarter. And the fourth quarter fee income is expected to increase 3% to 5% versus second quarter \u201815. The impact of the AmRisc investment will reduce controlling -- will reduce non-controlling interest expense in the range of $5 million to $15 million per quarter depending on seasonality. Finally, looking at non-interest expense, excluding the loss on debt restructuring and merger charges, expenses are expected to increase 3% to 5% in the third quarter and 6% to 8% in the fourth, both off of second quarter \u201815. We are on our way to achieving targeted savings for Susquehanna by the end of 2015. At least 32% of their expense base will be driven out of the runway. In summary, we produced a solid quarter including very strong loan growth, revenue growth and excellent credit quality. We look forward to executing the opportunities of our merger partners in the coming quarters. Now, let me turn it back over to Kelly for closing remarks and Q&A. Kelly King : Thanks Daryl. So, just to hit a couple of points that Daryl made and sum it. I think it was a really solid performance organically. As I said, we had excellent strategic execution, outstanding credit quality, capital and liquidity, positive revenue forecast, expense efficiency opportunity. And it\u2019s a tough environment, but overall for BB&T actually we\u2019re pretty excited about the future. So let\u2019s go Alan to Q&A. Alan Greer : Thank you, Kelly. Tracy, at this time if you would come back on the call and explain how our participants can participate in the Q&A session? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go first to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Two questions on the acquisition; one is -- and first of all, thanks for all the details, very helpful, on slide 19. The question is just on the timing of the cost saves -- I think on the merger and integration charges, you are pretty clear that there\u2019s going to be peak in 4Q \u201815. How do you see the timing of the cost saves over the course of -- starting in a couple of quarters to the 4Q \u201816? Kelly King : So Betsy, the cost saves goes essentially here up [ph] in fourth quarter look what we had though, but I\u2019d say that the cost saves will start occurring immediately and will be pretty basically completed by the end of \u201816. Betsy Graseck : Okay. But that should be like linear or there is going be a bump\u2026 Kelly King : It will be a negative curve linear. [Ph] I mean it will come off fast early on and then slower as you go towards the end of the year. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then pulling it altogether the accretion you\u2019re looking for from the deal, is it still in that 2% to 3% range? Daryl Bible : Yes. We\u2019re still targeting 3% what we originally said and we\u2019ll just see once we close on Susquehanna and see how we go forward and see how the loan portfolio performs and how we can efficiently find ways to run the company at future points. Kelly King : Absolutely. Betsy, based on what we know now versus what we knew when we announced that thing and having spent a lot of time out there, I\u2019d be marginally more positive than I was to start with. This is just a -- it\u2019s a really good company and the great markets, the receptivity of that company has been outstanding. Cultural integration is really smooth. So, it will be a great merger. Betsy Graseck : Alright, so it sounds like 3% plus. Okay, thank you. Kelly King : Yes. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Thanks a lot. Daryl, just one follow-up on the balance sheet. Thank you for giving us the period ends on the loans and the securities. And I\u2019m just wondering is there any other mix shift changes that we should consider when we\u2019re thinking about the size, the total size of the balance sheet going forward. Are you mixing out of cash or any other assets or is that going to be a pretty good read on where the earning assets should be? Daryl Bible : I think the earning assets should pretty much be what we told you. On the liability side, we are extinguishing the Federal home loan bank advances and you\u2019ll see us starting to call some of their trust preferred and other sub debt obligations as we\u2019re allowed to get those calls. So those will come off the balance sheet to help with run-rate. Ken Usdin : So, does that kind of get us in the 180 range on earning assets? Daryl Bible : Yes, that would be correct. I mean that\u2019s right. Ken Usdin : Second question, just on fee income, there is always a couple of moving parts and especially this quarter with insurance side. So, can you just give us an update on how much that\u2019s influencing the fee guide here in terms of the seasonality, the loss of the -- absence of the sold revenues and what you\u2019re looking for in that part of the business looking ahead? Chris Henson : This is Chris Henson, I\u2019d be happy to do that. It is a bit confusing. Last time I think mentioned we would be up about 3.3%; we did not at that time have approval to move forward American Coastal. So that happened subsequent to that guidance. So in fact what happened, what you should kind of look forward in third quarter is you would see fee income insurance drop in the 13%, 14% range, about 10% of that would be tagged to the loss of American Coastal, the balance would be seasonal. And then from there, you should see fourth quarter sort of moving up in 7.5% to 8.5% range to finish off the year. So, you have overall loss of revenue due to American Coastal in 2015 would be in the 90 million 92 million kind of range. So what you ended up with is seasonality. Those introduced just a bit more seasonality into the picture. On a go forward basis, if you were to kind of rerun this over \u201815 numbers and assuming the deal happened first quarter comparing with the deal, without a deal, look at pure seasonality. First and second quarter are going to be relatively flat, maybe a 1% or so different. In a typical seasonality on a go forward basis, you\u2019re going to be down in the third -- in the 8.5% kind of range and you should be up in the 4%, 5.5%, 6.5% kind of range, something like that. So, seasonality in insurance will be relatively flat with first a little stronger, first and second, then it falls in the third and then fourth quarter will be back up. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Kelly, can you really give us some thoughts on your outlook? Obviously you have two successful deals here, particularly the Susquehanna deal which is a good size win. What your view is on M&A for maybe next year, especially in light of the fact that some of your bigger competitors seem to be getting their internal systems upto a level that I think is acceptable to the regulators to maybe allow them to start to do bigger deals in the second half of next year and into \u201817. So, maybe give us how you see the landscape developing over the next 12 to 18 months? Kelly King : Gerard, we\u2019ve said for some time now that of course our M&A strategy is a supplement to our organic growth strategy and it remains so. I consistently say we would like to do 5% to 10% of our asset size in good quality acquisitions; we did that this year with Bank of Kentucky and Susquehanna. So that\u2019s $10 billion to $20 billion in a year, I feel confident in that same category range for next year. There are a number of institutions, let\u2019s just say in the $5 billion to $20 billion the range that I think are considering their strategic opportunities and may present some availabilities. The fact that there may be some other competitors out there to me is not something I have spent a lot of time worrying about. The partners that we talk to are ones that we\u2019ve known a long time and our cultures are very, very similar, our strategies are similar. And so I think that -- I mean there are some great other competitors out there in terms of acquiring companies and we won\u2019t get them all; we don\u2019t want them all. So, I think there\u2019s a very high probability that\u2019s going be what we like to do. Gerard Cassidy : As a follow-up Daryl, any commentary on -- you\u2019ve obviously converted to single general ledger. Did you -- I know Bank of Kentucky was a small deal; Susquehanna will be a better test for you folks on the integration. Is there a possibility you could get better expense savings because of better execution due to the newer systems you have? Daryl Bible : I would say that the newer systems down the road could give us some expense savings. We\u2019re still trying to get all the general ledger to be connected to the SAP system, there are other pieces that we\u2019re adding on to it this year and into next year. I would say that just -- opportunities that will walk you [ph] right away. Kelly King : So, Gerard, the way this works, it won\u2019t be specifically around acquisitions. The efficiencies in the system, currencies, [ph] when you really put all the technical out of the GO [ph] out through all, they have disparate systems and when you\u2019re drawing information in to the GO CCAR purposes and other management purposes, the host of information becomes much more seamless and efficient. So, it\u2019s not specific but it doesn\u2019t mean when you do an acquisition, you are more efficient. But as Daryl said, we\u2019ll continue to peel that out and it will take a little while before we get to the optimum state. But it is definitely a long-term efficiency improvement. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from John Pancari from Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Regarding a margin outlook, I know you have indicated stable for the core margin in third quarter. That implies I guess that Susquehanna has no real benefit to the margin despite having a somewhat higher margin I guess. So, is that the case or is there any other factor impacting that? Daryl Bible : John, when we bring Susquehanna in, we\u2019re going basically mark-to-market the balance sheet. So, in essence, their loans and their deposits come over to our company. Our best guess is core remains stable and then when interest rates start to rise, when the Fed starts raising and our core gets some expansion. We do get GAAP accretion on purchase accounting with Susquehanna, that\u2019s in the neighborhood of over two quarters; that will be 8 to 12 basis points. John Pancari : Right, okay. But the core doesn\u2019t benefit much? Daryl Bible : Not until really the Fed starts raising rates. John Pancari : And then separately, also on Susquehanna, can you just give us your updated thoughts on the plans for the Hann auto lease subsidiary? I know that was kind of on the table but what you do with that? And then secondly on Susquehanna, I just wonder if you could talk a little about revenue enhancement opportunity, not that we\u2019re out here trying to model that out, but it just seems like given their product breadth versus what BBT brings that there could really be opportunity to drive upside to that 3% accretion from the revenue side? Clarke Starnes : John, this is Clarke Starnes. I\u2019ll take the Hann question. We\u2019re working very closely with our partners at Susquehanna to evaluate how we integrate that platform and how we think about it going forward. We\u2019re fairly large in the sales finance business, so we believe the merger gives us an excellent opportunity in the Northeast and Pennsylvania and New Jersey markets. And so certainly Hann and the platform they have there around sales finance will be a benefit for us, but we\u2019re still evaluating what our appetite is for the leasing -- the consumer leasing component of that and we\u2019ll make those plans as soon as we can subsequent to the purchase. Kelly King : John, just one point John and then Chris can take a point. On revenue, they have a really good start retail strategy. So, we won\u2019t change that dramatically frankly. But the two big areas are going to be huge left, one is in corporate where we have a broader range of products and larger size, these two larger deals that they couldn\u2019t do, and then others as well, which Chris will talk about. Chris Henson : John, there is two I\u2019ll focus on, insurance and wealth. They have a retail insurance franchise called Addis Insurance and so we\u2019ll be converting that over in early fall. And that will give us a good beachhead start. And we typically don\u2019t get in these type acquisitions. And then we will look to acquire our way in and around their footprint. So we clearly have upside revenue there; timing is uncertain. We\u2019re already beginning to talk to potential opportunities over there. Secondly, we have a really nice opportunity in wealth. They had two subs, ones is Valley Forge that will plug into our wealth insurance business and we\u2019ll bring all of our products to them, to be able to deliver to the client, which I think is really helpful. And then they have a business called Stratton Management, this is asset management. We will plug that into our serving capital business. And we think a lot of opportunity again to provide more distribution to our company to help them move more far. So there are couple of additional good opportunities we believe. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Stephen Scouten with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Stephen Scouten : Question for you about the insurance fees and just the guidance moving forward there specifically with the American Coastal and AmRisc. If I\u2019m understanding the guidance there about the loss of revenues and the potential benefit, is that like a net negative to overall insurance for overall revenues by about 60 million a year? Kelly King : Well, it\u2019s actually going to be -- it actually could be a bit more than it. let me if I could just step back again and sort of read to the concept of why we did this because I think it\u2019s pretty important. We had two businesses, one American Coastal which we disposed off, we owned 100% of and then AmRisc which is a faster growing business, we own just a little less than half but have control. So, given we have control, we already have consolidated 100% of their numbers into ours. So, you won\u2019t see a move up at the top line from AmRisc, what you will see, to Daryl\u2019s earlier point, is you\u2019ll see a reduction in controlling interest which thereby means we will report more profitability out of that business by like amount. So, don\u2019t expect to see any improvement or increase in revenues as a result of AmRisc, although it is a higher margin business and is a faster growing business, and it is critical to the long-term piece of our enterprise because it interacts directly with our wholesale business and we\u2019re the second largest wholesaler in the country. So, it was integral to the long term franchise to repayment. Unlike an underwriting business that frankly is not to have but it presented risk. Then actually the benefit of moving Am Coastal out is it reduces risk. So to answer your question, it\u2019s actually about 140 million revenue company that would come out in terms of Am Coastal. And all I was saying earlier is that in last quarter\u2019s guidance, we did not know when it was going to close. So, we actually closed it June 1st. And so we have about 11 million in revenue this quarter and then it will drop in the third quarter we think about total revenue about 13% or so percent. And about 10% of that would be Am Coastal. Thereafter fourth quarter we bought [ph] back up in the 7.5% we 8.5% range. Daryl Bible : The other thing to remember is that the whole business is gone. So, it\u2019s not just revenue that correlates, it\u2019s expenses; it\u2019s earnings. So, I think in short term, it be might dilutive a penny or so but long term, AmRisc was growing a lot faster, American Coastal was more of a stable cash cow company. So, we think over the next couple of year, we\u2019ll actually turn from being slightly dilutive to being accretive. Kelly King : So, how we see it -- that is exactly right, we see it being sort of a dilutive, penny year one; roughly flattish year two and then growing thereafter. Because keep in mind, it\u2019s directly tied to the second largest wholesaler in the country, so very critical long-term. Stephen Scouten : And then one other question about the capital deployment timeline; are there any changes to that or you still expecting to start implementing the buyback in 3Q or would there be changes to that still with the potential announcement of incremental MK&A there? Kelly King : So Stephen remember that we\u2019ve said consistently that our strategy with regard to capital deployment is our organic growth, dividends, M&A and then adjusted forward buyback. We did have request and was approved for about $820 million or so of buyback and/or alternative uses of capital in our CCAR plan. We did recently have the board approve 50 million shares of that so we have functionally approved. But we actually consider what we do buyback on a day to day kind of basis based on our projection of acquisition opportunities. And frankly, the price of our stock and return in terms of applying stock backs. So, we can\u2019t tell you what that decision will be, the decision we will be making on a real time basis based on opportunities as they present themselves. Stephen Scouten : So the implication there would be if you\u2019re not buying back stock aggressively towards that 820 million in say 3Q then the likelihood of M&A is probably higher. Is that fair assessment? Kelly King : That would be a rush on induction. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous. Geoffrey Elliott : I\u2019ve got a question on the expense side. Could you give a bit more color on the 7% increase in personnel expense year-on-year, just how we reconcile that with the overall decline in average employees over the period? Daryl Bible : So, I mean if you look at the expenses, we noted in our deck that expenses were up due to our higher key businesses which tend to pay out higher incentives, so that would be in mortgage, Grandbridge and investment banking. So, that\u2019s a big driver. On a year-over-year basis AmRisc kind of washes other out. we did have higher cost in our healthcare oriented. And if you look at pension on a year-over-year basis, that\u2019s higher. So those are probably the main drivers. We also have Citi and Bank of Kentucky that came in. Those actually are adding not just FTEs there but they do have other run rate expenses. When I look at the delta, I look at more on a linked quarter than on a year-over-year quarter but on a linked quarter it\u2019s about 9 million higher but absolutely in the second quarter it\u2019s about 12 million just Bank of Kentucky and Citi so far and cost us more expenses in the second quarter before we start getting cost savings from Bank of Kentucky. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets. Paul Miller : On the federal loan bank borrowing extinguishment, does that clear at all your federal loan bank borrowings? Is there other opportunities to lower your borrowing costs by getting really some more other stuff down the road? Daryl Bible : Paul, we still have a little over $2 billion of what I would call long-term federal home bank advances that have average cost of over 4.5%. Right now the plan is to keep those on the books unless we have other opportunities to offset that. I think you saw us do a debt issuance as well. So, we\u2019re still keeping long fixed rate but we re-price the long-term debt down well over to 200 basis points. Paul Miller : And then the other question. You talked about this in your opening comments about the competitiveness of lending out there or what not. And we\u2019ve seen some of your competitors talk about the middle market commercial businesses are being really overbanked out there. Can you add some color? You\u2019ve seen the same stuff in the middle market and how do you define middle market at BB&T? Clarke Starnes : We define middle market generally companies with revenues up to about a $0.5 billion or so; everyone has a different view. So we probably own more. The lower end of the middle market is where we play those prominently and certainly in that space as well as the larger in shared credit space is extremely competitive. My personal opinion is some of the leverage lending guidance and push down around or limits around that is pushing the whole market more towards the middle market space and there is even more effort to bank those clients. And I think it\u2019s highly competitive. And as Kelly said though, we\u2019re doing really well there and we\u2019ve done excellent job, particularly in the last quarter or two in maintaining our spreads in a very, very difficult environment. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go next to Vivek Juneja from JP Morgan. Vivek Juneja : Hi, couple of questions, one is I want to confirm the 3% accretion from Susquehanna that already includes some revenue enhancement, right? Daryl Bible : I would say it was really driven more by cost saves. We do have fee income increasing over a five year time period but I would say the accretion out of the blocks in the first year or two is really more driven by cost saves, Vivek. And that over time is [indiscernible] thing and community bank and for us to get it perform the BB&T standards and we really get higher lift in lending as well as in our fee income areas. Vivek Juneja : Second thing : The efficiency ratio. Can you talk a little bit about why it\u2019s up linked quarter? And when I look at the efficiency ratio, this is where it was in the fourth quarter, it\u2019s been a bit jump; it\u2019s up I think looking at your own calculations of adjusted for non-recurring, it\u2019s up 300-400 basis points. That\u2019s a big change. Can you walk through why it\u2019s gone up this quarter, linked quarter and what\u2019s the plan for that? Kelly King : We said at the beginning of the year that we are not going to be spending as much time talking about efficiency ratio, just probably as you pointed out, it\u2019s [indiscernible] kind of question. And when you get so tightly focused on that one number, it gets to be misleading often times because it moves up or down based on what happens to the expenses and/or the revenues. So generally, right now though what\u2019s happening to us is that our expenses are elevated as we talked about all along in terms of our systems investments, risk management investments and some pre-investments with regard to some of the M&A activity. So all of that\u2019s kind of driving some of your expenses up. And so what we think now in terms of the general level of efficiency ratio given what I said in terms of the -- and ability to be real precise about it is that it\u2019s kind of peaked. And we think as we hit through next year, it will be slowly coming down. We still have an intermediate term target of 55% and we feel confident we\u2019ll be move ahead in that direction as we heads towards the end of next year. Vivek Juneja : And one last thing, so going back to acquisitions versus buybacks, it sounds like you are ready to do -- look at further deals, Kelly, right away. Is that -- is there a plan to just -- if you have to hold-off buybacks sort of quarter or two till you figure that out or is that -- is the approval based on a per quarter basis what you\u2019re supposed to get done? Kelly King : Well, the approval is basically based on kind of how you earn the capital. So, we -- those spread on a linear basis over the course of the year. But we have availability in the current quarter to do buybacks if we choose to. And as I said earlier, it\u2019s a function of our expectations around investment opportunities and our evaluation of our price relative to return in terms of acquiring our own stock. So, you\u2019re not going to be able to judge precisely exactly what we\u2019ll be able to do with that because we\u2019re not going to tell you exactly. We don\u2019t know exactly, it moves along. So what we really have to do is to judge the probabilities of investment opportunities and that\u2019s not a science; this is more of an art. And I\u2019m optimistic over the next 12 months or so we\u2019ll do -- have additional investment opportunities. Whether or not they coincide in a timeframe such that it would preclude us doing buybacks or not is we\u2019re unable to tell at this point. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Terry McEvoy from Stephens Inc. Terry McEvoy : Daryl, I was wondering if you could talk about your thoughts on purchase accounting accretion in 2016, specifically when does it peak; is it earlier in the year? And then what type of run-off or decline are you thinking about as the year progresses? Daryl Bible : For Susquehanna -- Bank of Kentucky really doesn\u2019t have a huge amount of purchase accounting. So I\u2019ll just deal with mainly Susquehanna. I would say that with the credit mark that we have which is about 4.5%, there will be approximately little under $600 million of accretable purchase accounting income that basically goes through net interest income over the life of the assets. At the same time though, we will have more loans that we take losses on and those loans will increase provision. And the timing won\u2019t necessarily match up. It\u2019s too early to say what the losses will be in the Susquehanna portfolio but know that we pretty much locked down the $580 million over life of the assets to call it five plus years. But it would be more earlier on and then it would tell off towards the end of the five-year period. And the losses could be sporadic over that same time period. The other thing to note is the portfolio of Susquehanna has to put it on the book; doesn\u2019t have an allowance to it. As new volume comes on from Susquehanna we have to provide for an allowance there. That\u2019s why we are talking about potential growth impact also of that portfolio on the provision. Terry McEvoy : Thanks and then as a follow-up, service charge is down 2.5% year-over-year. How much of that is a function of consumer behavior versus any specific actions you\u2019ve taken internally? And as you look ahead, anything to make you optimistic that that line of business will stabilize? And as it relates to Susquehanna, are there practices as it relates to these types of fees consistent with BB&T\u2019s? Chris Henson : I think it is largely consumer behavior. I mean clients have more access to information technologically and their overgrowing list and\u2026 Daryl Bible : We have higher deposit balances, so our clients are carrying larger balances now on hand, which seems they pay less in fees and just more with compensating balances. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Nancy Bush from NAB Research. Nancy Bush : We\u2019ve had some kind of mix commentary on economic outlook in the past couple of days. Richard Davis has been kind of bear on the economy came out and made some very strongly positive statements yesterday. But we\u2019ve had some other companies that were a little bit more subdued. Could you just give us your outlook and particularly with regard to the Southeast? Kelly King : Yes, Nancy, I suppose between some of the commentary you heard, I would be -- where I have been which kind of in the middle of the road, nothing -- economy has done a really solid 2% to 5% -- I mean, 2% to 2.5% real GDP growth. I see very little risk of any downside on that. I see very little opportunity, it could be substantially better than that until we get closer to election math, you get some real positive leadership information out of DC and there is some upside opportunity. But for the next 12 months, I think you will be pretty solidly focused on 2% to 2.5%, which is actually pretty good for you. This is nominal at about 4.5% to 5%, in terms of motion as a whole. I think [indiscernible] Nancy can probably beat that a bit because you\u2019re not talking about every year, this actually clearly took it on the chin. And everything go devalued but it has been -- values have been reset; activity slows and Florida back to grow and 800 people a day, including Texas, 1,000 people a day, but Atlanta\u2019s [ph] turned finally and the coastal markets of Carolina have tuned. So, I\u2019d say the Southeast will be net positive to the national growth rate, not dramatically but if the national is 2.5%, I wouldn\u2019t be a bit surprised to see the Southeast has 3.5%. Nancy Bush : And sort of ancillary to that, the outlook for the mortgage business, how do you see your mortgage banking activities proceeding over time here? Are we in sort of last -- great wave of purchase activity or how do you see BB&T proceeding in that business over the next couple of years? Kelly King : I think it will be steady to slightly up. The refinance, it is kind of last of that, I think, that\u2019s on dramatic international events. But look, purchase activity is really picking up; new home construction is up substantially and new home purchases is up; we\u2019re seeing a shift toward high percentage of purchases versus refis. So I think, you can think about it in terms of the steady to up, not dramatic up, steady to up. Operator : We are out of time for questions. So, this concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Alan Greer for any closing or additional remarks. Alan Greer : Okay. Thank you, Tracy. And thanks again everybody for joining us today. If you have further questions, feel free to contact Tamera or myself in Investor Relations. Thank you and we hope you have a great day. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation.",

And now I will turn it over to Kelly. Kelly King : Thanks, Alan. Good morning, everybody. And thanks for joining our call. We always appreciate your interest in our company. I\u2019d say overall, we had a strong quarter with higher revenues, improved net interest margin, continued excellent asset quality, very strong capital and liquidity and importantly we had three significant strategic developments which I will discuss. Net income was $490 million, up 8.4% versus last quarter on a GAAP basis. Our diluted EPS totaled $0.64, up an annualized 12.8% versus second quarter of 2015 and 3.2% versus last quarter. Excluding $77 million of pretax merger-related and restructuring charges, our adjusted diluted EPS totaled $0.70, up an annualized 5.7% versus second quarter 2015.  And importantly, our adjusted ROA was 1.13% and adjusted ROTCE was 14.4%. So we feel very good about that. In terms of revenues, revenues totaled $2.5 billion, up $122 million, largely due to Susquehanna which we closed on August 1, that is an annualized 20.4%. If you exclude the acquisition, revenues were lower due mainly to insurance seasonality, soft insurance pricing in that market and the sale of American Coastal which I\u2019ll remind you was in connection with our substantial increase in our ownership of AmRisc which is a really steady and promising fee income business. Our fee income ratio was 42.1% versus 44.3% for the last third quarter. Net interest margin did increased eight basis points to 3.35 primarily due to purchase accounting.  In the expense control area, if you exclude the impact of acquisitions, non-interest expenses are modestly lower for the quarter versus the second quarter. I will point out though that the environment remains very challenging and we remain very tightly focused on expense control.  I am very pleased that we have the opportunity to rationalize the expense basis from the Bank of Kentucky and Susquehanna acquisition. This is an important part of our expense strategy and gives us the real lever that would be available if we were not in the acquisition business.  In terms of the lending area, just a couple of highlights and then I\u2019ll give you a little bit more deep dive. Loans and leases held for investment totaled $130.5 billion, third quarter versus $120 billion into second and if you exclude acquisitions, average loans grew 3.2% annualized versus second quarter or 6.7% excluding residential, which is really kind of the run rate that you can \u2013 I want to think about because we are consciously running down our resi portfolio. Organic loan growth was really kind of focused on the C&I, CRE, Direct Retail, Sheffield and Grandbridge. So you can see it was very broad based.  We had three, what I consider to be significant strategic developments during the course of the quarter. We did successfully closed Susquehanna on August the 1st. I would just tell you that the merger is going great. We expect the conversion in November. Rick and I have now visited all of the four regions that come through Susquehanna, three in Pennsylvania and then our expanded Maryland branch. The client reaction has been fantastic. We often times get clients just really excited because, a lot of these folks have winter homes in Florida and they really like being able to get in down and not having to change the banks and so that\u2019s been a real positive hits for the clients. So it\u2019s been real, real positive. Associate engagement is superb. They really like our culture and they embraced it really, really quickly.  I will imagine Susquehanna had the best client service quality in their market and so it\u2019s a really high quality plan and service quality for a company just like ours is. I will just say overall, this is just going to be a fantastic merger.  We did also announce agreement to acquire National Penn Bancshares. Just as a reminder it\u2019s $9.6 billion in assets, $6.7 billion in deposits, 124 branches. It\u2019s a really good institution. It has deep relationships with its clients. It also has very good client service quality, very community-oriented. If you combine these two together, we will move up quickly to a number four market share in Pennsylvania, which is a really big market to have a number four market share in a short period of time. And not only the market share, but we have excellent efficiencies coming out of the combination of these two institutions in that marketplace and more importantly, we have outstanding market potential going forward. So, it\u2019s a great place to be where you already have big market share with lot of efficiencies and you have huge opportunities in places like Philadelphia and really throughout the entire mid Pennsylvania area.  So, we are really, really excited about Pennsylvania. It\u2019s a good market, it has got a lot of wealth and it offers us a huge amount of potential in all aspects, but I would particularly call out insurance and wealth management.  And finally, we are very excited about the fact we introduced U to the marketplace. This is our new digital platform. It is innovative. We think it\u2019s the best in the marketplace. The two big cornerstones of U and we use that is the letter U to represent the fact that we are focusing on the client is that it is an integrated platform which allows the clients to bring together easily all the information in BB&T and other information from other financial intermediaries and they can customize the offering on their device.  And they have single list of consistent information across all devices. And so we would say it\u2019s really uniquely different. I\u2019d recommend you try it. It\u2019s really good offering in the marketplace. Now, a little bit of a deeper dive into lending. C&I loan growth was strong in the quarter. Average core C&I loans were up $715 million, which was 6.7% annualized. This was led by large corporate lending, but solid production in the branch network as well. I will point out the C&I lending still is significantly in larger participation and that market is still very competitive. Spreads are very tight. So we\u2019re being cautious even though we are growing it. We currently expect C&I to grow in the fourth quarter but more modestly when you exclude acquisitions. I just want to point out again that our oil and gas portfolio reserve base lending is small at $1.1 billion, less than 1% of our outstandings. It\u2019s very conservative, 90% upstream, 10% mid to midstream, practically no exposure in service and supply. And I would just point out that we did review our portfolio in the last quarter and we currently have absolutely no non-accruals in this portfolio.  So, it\u2019s really, really good portfolio. We\u2019ve been conservative. We are been conservative and we feel good about it from a long-term point of view. In CRE construction and development, it includes $128 million or 18.4% annualized if you exclude acquisitions and the period was a little bit slower but organic growth has driven the single-family construction, hospital projects. So pretty diversified. Our expectation now is that C&D growth be a little seasonally softer in the fourth quarter which you would expect. CRE income producing increased to $127 million or 4.7% annualized this quarter, again if you exclude acquisitions. In this portfolio, growth was broad based and included increases in multi-family, office, hospitality, industrial. The fundamentals in all of those businesses in the marketplace continue to improve, but I would tell you that the spreads in the marketplace continue to tighten. I keep asking our lending folks when is it going to get better and they say, well, as of yesterday it hadn\u2019t gotten better. So, it\u2019s still a tough marketplace out there. And again, we are being careful because we don\u2019t want assets that don\u2019t produce good risk-adjusted returns on capital. So we expect core C&I IPP to slow and be about flat for the fourth quarter.  Direct Retail Lending is having a really good movement in our company today. It\u2019s performing very well. Increased $253 million or on the 12% annualized. Lot of growth in HELOCs home equity lines and direct auto lending in branches has got really strong momentum at this point. Wealth continues to really move market share for us to make some major contribution hitting new records every month.  And the community bank is really growing this direct retail book. So, we have great momentum in the direct retail lending heading into fourth quarter and we currently expect the direct retail lending to continue to grow, be a little bit of seasonal slowdown, but still good growth in that market in the fourth quarter and if you exclude acquisitions and sales finance, which is, I\u2019ll remind you largely prime auto lending for us, it declined $278 million or 11.6% in the quarter for two reasons; one is we continue to be very careful in these tighter spread paper offerings with unacceptable terms that we are seeing that marketplace.  It\u2019s just not \u2013 it just didn\u2019t give you a decent risk-adjusted return on capital. And so, we are being very, very careful on that and related to that is we did transition to a flat rate compensation model for our dealers. We think this is a better program for our dealers long-term.  The overall feedback from our dealers is they like it. There is little confusion because it\u2019s new but, the more time we have to get out and explain it to our dealers, we think it will settle in to a very profitable level. It maybe a lower volume level, but it be a more profitable level, which is what we are really focusing on. So we would just say this area to see a similar decline in the fourth quarter.  In residential mortgages, recall, we allow in our portfolio to runoff, so they were down $548 million or 7.3% linked-quarter annualized. That includes the sale of all of \u2013 essentially all of our conforming production. In terms of production originations in the quarter were $5 billion which was 8% lower than the second quarter and applications were down, but higher than the third quarter of last year. So, it\u2019s kind of stable in terms of applications and production today. Gains on margins were about flat.  So looking forward in this business, we expect contraction in the resi portfolio by design absent the impact of Susquehanna, although it might be a little slower next quarter. In the other lending subsidiaries, good quarter. We grew $609 million and 20.6% annualized.  As you know, this is always a seasonally stronger quarter for us, strong performance in Sheffield, Grandbridge. Our insurance premium finance businesses in AFCO / CAFO and Prime Rate, Regional Acceptance had another very strong quarter. Remember the fourth quarter is seasonally slower in these businesses and so we\u2019d expect growth to be slower next quarter. So to sum up, in total, we expect average loans held for investment to be essentially flat on a core basis excluding acquisitions given the seasonal decline that we always experienced in the quarter for us. So there is nothing new about that if you - excluding mortgage, less modest if you include.  Including all the deals, obviously our growth rate will be significantly higher and annualized loan growth is expected to be in the low double-digits including acquisitions. I will point out to you that while we try to, when we can point out the difference between GAAP and adjusting for acquisitions, the fact is, we are acquiring assets that are income producing and takes a lot of work to \u2013 these loans on the books.  So, from myself, it is real growth and so we try to make sure you understand both that we are very excited about these new assets and think that be really productive for us as we go forward.  Taking a look at deposits on Slide 5, it\u2019s just another really strong deposit performance quarter. Non-interest bearing deposits or DDA was up 6.9% on a linked-quarter adjusted and so we feel really good about that. Third to second, annualized it\u2019s actually 25%. If you look at the total deposits on third quarter to second quarter 2015, that\u2019s 3.6% and so the deposit portfolio is performing well. Our costs are remaining low at 0.24% on the total deposits and excluding acquisitions, our average non-interest bearing deposit mix was 31.7% in the third quarter versus 31.5% in the second quarter. So, modest improvement there, but at a very, very high level for us.  So let me turn it over to Daryl now for some more color in a lot of detail areas. Daryl Bible : Thank you, Kelly and good morning everyone. Today I am going to talk to you about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, non-interest expense, capital, and our segment results.  Continuing on Slide 6. As Kelly said, we are very pleased to report a strong third quarter. We met much of the guidance from last quarter and the closing of Susquehanna has gone very well. Credit quality remains excellent; net charge-offs were 32 basis points, down 1 basis point. Excluding Regional Acceptance, net charge-offs were only 15 basis points. Loans past due 90 days or more were higher due to the acquisition. Excluding Susquehanna, loans 90 days past due decreased 10.5%. Loans 30 to 89 days past due increased 9% due to the acquisition and seasonality.  Going forward, we expect net charge-offs including Susquehanna to be between 35 and 45 basis points in the fourth quarter, assuming no material decline in the economy. NPAs increased 2.1% in total and 0.5% excluding Susquehanna. Looking forward, we continue to expect NPA levels to remain in a similar range.  Looking on Slide 7, our allowance coverage ratios remains strong at 3.44 times for net charge-offs and 2.49 times per NPLs. The total allowance to loans ratio was 1.08 on a GAAP basis, which includes $12.8 billion of acquired loans, marked at 4.45% with no related allowance.  Excluding Susquehanna, the allowance as a percentage of loans remained at 1.19%. We recorded a provision of $103 million for the quarter compared to net charge-offs of $107 million.  Looking ahead, we expect fourth quarter provision to be based on charge-offs and new loan growth in Susquehanna regions.  Continuing on Slide eight. Net interest margin was 3.35%, up 8 basis points on the impact of purchase accounting and better than our guidance. Core margin was 3.15%, down 1 basis points. In the fourth quarter, we expect GAAP and core margin to be relatively flat compared with third quarter assuming no Fed rate hikes. We continue to be slightly more asset-sensitive this quarter mostly due to acquisitions that drove favorable changes in net free funds and deposit mix. We will definitely benefit should the fed begin to raise interest rates.  Turning to Slide 9. We experienced a seasonal decline in insurance and mortgage banking income offset by higher service charges on deposits and other income. The fee income ratio declined to 42.1% reflecting that these declines and the impact of Susquehanna on our revenue mix.  Remember, Susquehanna\u2019s fee income ratio was only 20%. A bit more on that detail. First, insurance income declined $68 million compared to the second quarter due to more seasonality and the sale of American Coastal. Additionally, the insurance market has experienced pricing softness which slowed our light quarter same-store sales growth to about 2%. Second, mortgage banking income decreased $19 million reflecting lower net mortgage servicing rates income and a decrease in commercial mortgage volume offset by an increase in residential income.  Third, service charges on deposits increased $13 million driven by new accounts and increased activity. And finally, other income increased $27 million due to higher income on private equity investments of $22 million partially offset by $19 million of lower income related to assets for certain post-employment benefit expense and pre-tax loss in the second quarter due to the sale of American Coastal. Looking on Slide 10, non-interest expenses totaled $1.6 billion in the third quarter. Expenses excluding merger-related charges and last quarter\u2019s loss on the early extinguishment of debt increased 4.2% including Susquehanna, which is consistent with our guidance. If you exclude the impact of Susquehanna on our total non-interest expenses, we were down slightly. So we are doing a good job of controlling core expenses.  The primary contributors to the change in non-interest expenses were personnel expense increased $18 million due to Susquehanna related personnel cost of $37 million, offset by lower post-employment benefit expense of $19 million. FTEs were up 2400 excluding acquisition, FTEs remained almost flat. Occupancy and equipment expense increased $17 million mostly due to acquisitions. Merger-related and restructuring charges totaled $77 million. Susquehanna and the Bank of Kentucky totaled $69 million and $5 million respectively. Our effective tax rate was 29.4% and we expect the effective tax rate of about 30% in the fourth quarter. We expect merger-related charges to again to be in the $60 million to $80 million range in the fourth quarter. We remain confident in achieving our targeted cost savings from our announced acquisitions and we will improve our efficiency throughout 2016. Turning to Slide 11. Capital ratios remain very strong with Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital at 10.1%. The acquisition of Susquehanna used 60 basis of common equity Tier 1 capital. Fully phased-in common equity Tier-1 capital was 9.8% Looking at liquidity, our LCR increased to 136% due to the Susquehanna acquisition causing a decrease in wholesale funding and increases in high quality securities. Also our liquid asset buffer at the end of the quarter was strong at 13.3%. If we begin to look at our segment results on Slide 12, please note that these results exclude Susquehanna. Once we complete the system conversion in November, we will incorporate these results. Susquehanna results from the first two months show we are off to a good start and are exceeding expectations from an earnings perspective.  The community bank\u2019s net income was up $30 million from last quarter, driven by growth in commercial lending, retail lending and deposits, as well as higher funding spreads partially offset by lower rates on commercial production. Loan production continues to be very good, with total commercial loans up 13% and Direct Retail up almost 17% linked-quarter. Turning to Slide 13. Residential mortgage banking income totaled $60 million, down $12 million from last quarter. This was driven by a decrease in net MSR income and it\u2019s partially offset by mortgage loan production. Production mix in the quarter was two-thirds purchase, one-third refi.  Turning to Slide 14. Dealer financial services income totaled $43 million down $6 million from last quarter due to higher provision. Asset quality indicators for dealer finance are performing very well. Regional Acceptance continues to perform within our risk appetite.  Turning to slide 15. Specialized lending net income totaled $62 million, down $8 million from last quarter driven by lower commercial mortgage income, and lower gains on finance leases. Sheffield, which finances equipment for consumers and small businesses experienced solid loan growth up 28.5% linked-quarter. Credit metrics experienced some normal seasonality with charge-offs at 27 basis points. Looking at Slide 16. Insurance services net income totaled $21 million down $32 million from last quarter, mostly driven by a seasonal decrease in commercial property and casualty insurance and lower insurance premiums due to the sale of American Coastal in the second quarter. Like quarter same-store sales achieved 1.4% growth as the market for insurance pricing is softer. Turning to Slide 17. Financial services segment had $83 million in income, up $15 million from last quarter. Corporate banking generated significant loan growth of 26% and deposit growth of 32%, wealth experienced 28% loan growth. Non-interest income increased $15 million linked-quarter due to higher SBIC partnership income and investment advisory fees.  In summary, we produced a strong quarter including very strong broad based loan growth, revenue growth due to Susquehanna acquisition and excellent credit quality. We look forward to executing opportunities with our merger partners in the coming quarters. Now, let me turn it back over to Kelly for closing remarks and Q&A. Kelly King : Thanks Daryl. So, again just to reinforce a couple of points, it was a strong quarter, higher revenues, increased margin, excellent asset quality, strong capital and liquidity, focused expense management, three really important strategic developments. Really great opportunities in several large markets, particularly including Texas and Pennsylvania. So I would say, overall, given that it is a challenging environment out there, we remain very optimistic about our future at BB&T. Alan, I will turn it back over to you for Q&A. Alan Greer : Okay. Thank you, Kelly. Eric, at this time if you would come back on the line and explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go first to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Daryl Bible : Good morning. Kelly King : Hey Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Two questions, one on the loan growth. I realize there is a lot of puts and takes with the acquisition, but it does seem relatively strong especially compared to what we are seeing from other institutions and what we are hearing about in the headlines with regard to investment activity. So, and I also realize that the third quarter is a seasonally strong quarter for the specialized lending group, but could you just give us a sense as to whether or not you feel that this is a one-off or if the underlying demand for borrowing is actually stronger than what we are seeing from other folks because your region? Kelly King : Betsy, I\u2019ll give you a general comment then Clarke can add some color. So, clearly as you pointed out, we did had seasonal positive impact in the third, but remember that we do have these diversified businesses that are really helping us in terms of ongoing growth while they are seasonally stronger in the third, they don\u2019t go away completely into fourth. So that\u2019s just our ongoing strategic advantage we have. We have lots of these new markets where we have tiny market shares. So, while the markets may not be growing very fast, we are able to get some real tractions and turn some market share movement. So, the challenge for us is that, there is a lot of opportunity for us, because we are in a lot of new markets. But we are very careful and conservative in terms of underwriting and pricing and so we could be growing a lot faster, not because of markets growing that fast but because we have some tine market shares in these new markets. But I don\u2019t expect us to grow tremendously faster than we are growing now because we remain very disciplined but, Clarke you may want to add more color to that? Clarke Starnes : Yes, I\u2019d just echo what Kelly said, a big driver of the third quarter always is the seasonality in our subsidiary businesses. So I wouldn\u2019t say that demand was materially higher, it was just a typical seasonality we see on \u2013 particularly on the C&I side. I would just remind you Betsy, that we are still relatively under penetrated in the larger middle market area in our corporate lending group. And so, again, we are just moving up to our reasonable share of the market there. So I think that necessarily new demand in the overall market is just our penetration there, but I think one bright spot for the quarter that was unique is we had the strongest growth in C&I and our community bank portfolio than we\u2019ve seen in a long time. So, Ricky, you might want to comment. Ricky Brown : Yes, thank you, Clarke, we did. We had a very good quarter production, linked-quarter was up in C&I, well it went almost 20% and that was really strong for us. We had growth in C&I for the quarter linked, which was solid, it bucked the trend of what we've been seeing because of this Main Street Wall Street kind of dilemma, where Main Street has been very slow. I don\u2019t think it really sends a message that things are significantly different. I think it just sends a message that we\u2019ve been working really hard as Kelly said, our opportunities in Texas and South Florida and Washington DC and Atlanta are all giving us good opportunities. And in fact, that\u2019s where the most of our growth did occur in the larger regions in Texas and Florida and DC and Atlanta. We continue to be in pretty good shape with our pipelines. They are holding up fairly well. Our CRE business had a good production quarter as well. Growth was not quite as robust, part of that was just we had some paydowns with some construction projects, but good activity. So we look at the third quarter of this year as one of our very, very best quarters, but I think it is not necessarily market, it\u2019s just the fact we\u2019ve been working really, really hard. Betsy Graseck : Okay, some market share gain, that\u2019s really helpful. The follow-up is, a little bit of an unusual question, but it has to do with U mobile app kind of that you mentioned you launched. One of the questions I get from investors is, how do you measure the ROIC on things like this and it feels like the mobile app that you have critical for gaining new customers in millennial et cetera. I am just wondering how do you determine the value and how do you measure its success over time? Ricky Brown : Betsy, this is Ricky. Thank you for that question. What we think is that this really has three prongs that we hope to be able to exploit. First is that we think it can be a real driver for new household acquisition, and particularly in the Millennial space, it should really be attractive for Millennials and the early returns they really, really like it. Secondly, we see this as a big opportunity to reduce attrition. So if we can get our existing clients to put more of their financial lives on our application integrate with more products, we get them to be stickier and attrition goes down. And then thirdly, we hope to be able to launch more cross-sell activities, because they are going to be able to see things more clearly, be able to use their products more effectively and the good news about this platform as Kelly said is, it\u2019s integrated, it\u2019s not built at a private that has an in lock that it will iterate over time or be able to add new products to it. Clients will be able to choose what they want, they\u2019ll be customizing the look that they want for themselves. So we think it\u2019s pretty, pretty unique and we feel really, really good about it. We are about one month into all regions having access to the product in terms of clients. All of our new clients that we are signing up for our online services are going through our U platform. We are beginning the process of converting existing clients through an up-sale and or a request process. So far we\u2019ve got approximately 70,000 users on the platform and that\u2019s only in about a three or four week timeframe. So we think it\u2019s really being adopted very well and the response to the application has been exceptional, that\u2019s what we are getting from our people in the field that what our people are driving this program getting feedback is it\u2019s been very, very good. As we said, it iterates and we hope that through our next release, we will be able to have the ability for folks to have stock reports on their application. They will be able to get weather and news and we also are very hopeful that we\u2019ll have a FICO score that would be refreshed every quarter for our clients to be able to see. So that we think that\u2019s the important for them to understand credit and financial literacy and that\u2019s a way we can help do that. So, we are very excited about the platform and we hope we will continue to get good growth. Kelly King : And Betsy, one final point. With regard to the analytical part of your question on the ROIC, as you alluded to, it is really hard to measure the specific ROIC on any individual products particularly in the case of the SORC platform because what will happen here is to return on capital will bleed over into all of the areas. So your deposit profitability will go up because you have higher acquisition and lower attrition and so forth. So, it\u2019s practically impossible to measure it, but I would point out that on a product like this, because in terms of putting it up, it\u2019s actually a very people-sensitive strategy. It didn\u2019t take a huge amount of actual capital in terms of equipment et cetera to put it out. So it\u2019s not a huge investment of capital. I am quite confident long-term to implicit total return is outstanding but I\u2019d be really, really be hard pressed to try to prove it exactly. Betsy Graseck : Okay, now that\u2019s helpful and the point about attrition is importance of being a first mover is critical in the space. So I appreciate them. Kelly King : Right. Betsy Graseck : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Good morning. Daryl Bible : Good morning. John Pancari : Wanted to see if you go \u2013 on the loan growth front, I appreciate the color you gave on the seasonality and then the outlook for next quarter. But I wanted to see if we can get a little bit more color on \u2013 into the 2016 outlook. Kelly, I think you had indicated that that 3% annualized level that we saw this quarter maybe a fair way to think about it. So, is that how we should be thinking about 16 that it could be at the lower end of that 3% to 5% range? Daryl Bible : Hey, John, this is Daryl. We are right in the midst of our planning period right now and we typically update everybody on 2016 what\u2019s going to happen in our January earnings call. So we are kind of lay low on any 2016 guidance right now. John Pancari : Okay and I guess then if we could kind of talk a little bit more about the components. If you can give a little bit more detail on your strategy around mortgage, I know you have indicated that you are pairing that back and letting some of that run-off, what is the strategy there, as we move through the next couple of quarters and the rationale behind it. Is it more at a rate-sensitivity? Clarke Starnes : John, this is Clarke and Daryl could kick in on the rate-sensitivity I think for us. We just think those were very low margin assets for us with long duration and so we are \u2013 we would prefer to focus on being an originator and creating in the mortgage making income and just not use our balance sheet so extensively there. So we are very focused on volumes and originations but it\u2019s more in a form of producing the fee income. Daryl Bible : Yes, John, this is Daryl. If you look at the credit spread that we make on mortgages, if we put it on balance sheet because of the long tale in a negative convexity that mortgages have \u2013 you are less than a 100 basis points, about 85 basis point credit spread. So it\u2019s really hard to get any good long predictable returns in that business and we\u2019ve been doing this strategy now for several quarters and what we are seeing in our balance sheet is that we are basically originating less fixed rate and more floating rate which is what you would say more about 50-50 mix now. So it\u2019s been significant move on our sensitivity to a little bit asset-sensitive, less tail risks, but we really are capturing all the revenue and volume because we are originating everything we can do on our markets, which is choose to securitize and all the conforming products. So it\u2019s not going on balance sheet. Kelly King : And then finally, John, I would just point out that we and I suspect everybody today are looking much more carefully at the components of our balance sheet in terms of risk-adjusted returns. Remember that there\u2019s been a dramatic increase in capital and liquidity in the banking business today, certainly true for us. We believe that\u2019s going to remain to be true and so historically, you kind of look to the bank and have strong loan growth kind of feels good about that. It\u2019s not quite that clear today. Strong loan growth does not inherently means improvement in shareholder returns and so, if you can grow loans that have good asset quality and have really good returns relative to the rates you can get, that\u2019s a good deal, but if you originate narrow spread loans that have a low return on equity, you either need to build originating sale or you shouldn\u2019t be in that business. So you will see us like in dealer finance and in mortgage today you\u2019ve seen us tweaking our strategies and you may see more of that as we go forward. John Pancari : Okay, that's helpful Kelly. That leads me to my very last thing for you is that, you kind of alluded to that same theme on C&I to a degree, you indicated that you are seeing spreads continue to tighten. Is there a bit more cautiousness that you are dialing into your C&I production as well? Kelly King : Yes, absolutely. I mean that market, I keep waiting for it to turn because, as I just alluded to, everybody has got some capital out there and so at some point the industry really had to turn on this, but it hasn\u2019t turned yet and so this \u2013 I think what\u2019s happening, John, is that, everybody is struggling with the fact that the economy is growing slowly, expenses are going up, and you naturally think that growing loans is the way out of that trap, But, we\u2019ve kind of concluded that that growing loans just by growing loans is not a good strategy and so, yes, we will be very careful in that marketplace and based on today\u2019s pricing, you would not expect to see that grow at a very fast pace. John Pancari : Okay, thanks, Kelly. Kelly King : Yes. Operator : The next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Hi Darryl, hi Kelly. Kelly King : Hey, Gerard, how are you doing? Gerard Cassidy : Good. Kelly, can you give us some thoughts on acquisitions? I think in your prepared remarks you used the expression you are in the acquisition business and you have already come out and said that your deals are currently underway will prevent you or you have chosen not to do any more deals until possibly late next year or 2017. Can you give us some thoughts on when a large deal could be considered and what the ramifications would be going over $250 billion in assets in the change in the regulatory complexity for your organization? Kelly King : Yes, Gerard, what we said is that, we are really happy about the deals that we have underway. But because, for us, our M&A has a very long-term strategy, it\u2019s been very successful for us. It has been very successful for us because we measure our sales and we do what we do well. And so, after we announced National Penn we simply say we are going to take a pause and we are going to make sure we do everything while having to reservation about that except this being sure that we stay focused and so, we are tightly focused on executing on these now and as I said, they are going very, very well. Long-term, our acquisition strategy has not changed. We think we still like to grow 5% to 10% of our assets in new deals each year, but I think sometimes when we are talking about this, people expect that will turn into a lot of \u2013 so that\u2019s like $10 billion to $20 billion, so you might see us do more than $10 billion in assets in a particular year which is pretty immaterial. To be honest, Gerard, I don\u2019t think there is much activity and large deals today depending on how you define large. Our focus is in that ideally in the $10 billion to $25 billion range. So if you think in large, it\u2019s above that. We are not in that game today. So, I think there has been a lot of talk historically about that, but as far as I can see today, BB&T doing anything larger than 25 is virtually unlikely. Therefore, with regard to the $250 billion level, we could do another one or two smaller ones over the next couple of years and still not be over depending on how organic growth is going. You say that we are measuring our organic growth, so as we are able to see acquisition opportunities, at reasonable prices, we can tailor back more organic growth, keep our balance sheet under $250 billion and improve our overall return on capital pretty dramatically. Nonetheless, from a long-term point of view, I fully expect us to go past $250 billion, but as I said at one point, you wouldn\u2019t expect us to be at $249 billion and do a $2 billion to go to $251 billion. I don\u2019t think that would be very rational. And so, as we approach that $250 billion level, we will just have to be pretty clear that we\u2019ve got lined up opportunities that will get us pretty meaningfully over that in the not too distant future. So, Gerard, if the $250 billion is not as big a deal as lot of people think it is, it does have OCI implication, it does have some advanced approaches implications. But other than that, we are already being regulated that if we were over $250 billion. So, it\u2019s under the guides of our good practices and so we are making all the efforts to methodically move to be prepared from a regulatory perspective to go past $250 billion. We are not in a rush to do it. We are tightly focused right now Gerard on shareholder returns. And so, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see us being little slower in acquisitions than people expect because we did a lot. We did over $30 billion in the last year and that\u2019s a lot and particularly in a slow growth environment, we are really so tightly focused on returns and let the shareholders benefit from what we\u2018ve done already. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. And then as a follow-up question, staying on this theme of acquisitions, with the announcement of the new digital channel U, how do you think that's going to factor into your guys thinking on a go-forward basis of branches of potential targets if U turns out to be as good as Ricky just described, will branches be as important to you on a go-forward basis and acquisitions as maybe three, four, five years ago? Ricky Brown : Gerard, this is Ricky. Thank you for the question. We see branches continuing to be a very important part of our delivery channels to our clients. Still from data we can see clients do want to have a branch. They see that as the real tangible evidence of their money and they like to be able to get to it if they got a problem they will be able to walk in and see somebody face to face and clients still see, I think financial institutions as a people business. And yes, we are getting more mobile and more digital when things like U and other types of digital offerings are there. But we still see branches important. We will be very judicious in terms of expansion of branches and I think we got to be very careful about acquisitions to ensure that what we do acquire would fit in the distribution system that makes sense and over the long haul, we will clearly try to rationalize the number of branches that we\u2019ve got. We\u2019ve been doing that year after year after year. We will be doing that with National Penn and Susquehanna. We have already announced that we were closing 22. We think there is some more that we will be evaluating when they will happen. But clearly, rationalization of your branching network is the direction that we are going to continue to go in. We think that with the advent of digital and things like U, that we\u2019ll be able to go into markets where we\u2019ve gotten great distribution, great coverage, great brand and perhaps be able to take branches out that you wouldn\u2019t ordinarily think that you would be able to take out because you can absorb them into your digital space into your overall branch distribution. We are doing a few experiments on that as we speak so far successfully. We think there are other opportunities. So, we think that long-term branches play a big part. We think that you got to do things like U. You got to have a good ATM system. You got to have a good call center system. You got to have 24/7 access that\u2019s absolutely consistent with our point of client experience. But long-term you got to figure out how to have the interplay between all of these channels so the client gets the access to BB&T, but clearly our most expensive channel is the branch. We will be rationalizing over time and we will be building smaller branches when we do build them reducing cost in that network is important. Kelly King : So, just a final overall conceptual perspective with regard to M&A and this issue, historically, you thought about M&A as you are acquiring loans and deposits and a bunch of branches, and that\u2019s why some people asking today why would you do it, because you have all those branches and branches are going away, that\u2019s not really looking into the essence of what you really do when you are acquiring it. You\u2019ve gotten this issue, you are acquiring relationships with clients which has created these relationships of the associates and the clients. So, we go in and we do rationalize the loan structure. We do go in and rationalize the deposit structure, but now, you do go in and rationalize the branch structure. But just because you go in and close branches, if you are \u2013 for example, it\u2019s more effective which we think it will be, you go in and close more branches, that\u2019s just one more really good opportunity to reduce the expenses. Eliminating a branch doesn\u2019t mean you eliminate the client. In fact, by having a really well developed integrated platform like U, it gives you more opportunities, Rick alluded to, to be a little more aggressive on the branch side. So it\u2019s not a negative, it\u2019s just a more of a positive than it has been in the past. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Operator : We will go next to Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets Paul Miller : Yes, a follow-up on Gerard's question, on acquisitions, what about - like you guys have been active in the insurance space and leasing space and what not. Could we see some small fill-in acquisitions over the next year? Chris Henson : Yes, Paul, this is Chris Henson. We definitely could, I think, specifically on the areas of Texas and Pennsylvania, we will need to build up those markets. And that\u2019s why I think you had the key, I think likely to be small fill-in where we don\u2019t represent the branching network currently. We really don\u2019t have to have anything else with respect to products. We have all the product coverage so it be small fill-in. Paul Miller : And then on the mortgage question, I thought you guys did a pretty good job talking about why you don't want conforming stuff, but you are seeing a move in some institutions, especially to drive some private wealth is the booking jumbo loans. Have you even thought about - or are you doing it on the jumbo side putting those on your balance sheet? Clarke Starnes : Paul, this is Clarke. Absolutely, as Chris mentioned in some his comments, we had a really strong growth rate in our merging wealth model and a big part of that is home mortgage finance and so we are very active on jumbos and construction and perm loans for those clients and we do a whole those on the balance sheet and feel really good about that. So I think you would see that as a growth area and it\u2019s a focal point for us in the future. Chris Henson : We even have a specific program that\u2019s really more sort of a white \u2013 approach to the wealth side as you mentioned. Paul Miller : And did you guys disclose what - how much jumbos you do out of the $5 billion that you did this quarter? Daryl Bible : We didn\u2019t cover that, Paul, we can get it for you real quickly. Paul Miller : You can just follow \u2013 I mean, just follow-up later on, that's okay. Daryl Bible : Follow-up \u2013 call Alan or Tamera. They will get you that number. Paul Miller : Okay. Daryl Bible : One of the other benefits, Paul, is, jumbos tend to be more shorter duration. You basically don\u2019t stay in the houses as long so it\u2019s a shorter asset for our balance sheet as well. Paul Miller : Yes, okay. Hey guys, thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from Michael Rose with Raymond James. Michael Rose : Hey, good morning guys. How are you? Daryl Bible : Great, good morning. Michael Rose : Hey, Kelly just wanted to maybe get a sense for your outlook for the insurance business. We are running mid-teens in terms of percentage of revenue. Where can we expect that to shake out over the next couple of years and obviously you've done some stuff there. Just wanted to get your general outlook for insurance? Kelly King : So, we said, Michael that, clearly, insurance is our best and most significant non-spread business. Last quarter it was about 18% of revenue. To be honest, some people want us to grow really, really fast and we could be growing much faster. But, the overarching strategy for us is diversification. So it\u2019s good as insurance is, we are not going to grow it so fast as a percentage of our business because there could be scenario where insurance gets really bad. In fact, it\u2019s not as good today as it was ten years ago at certain points because of little bit softer market and we think that will be changing going forward. So, actually as we do things like Susquehanna and all those, where we build a revenue stream we can grow insurance faster. So, we wouldn\u2019t want to think about insurance as revenue getting materially over, say 20% of revenues and \u2013 but what we think will happen is the rest of the bank will grow and we will be able to grow insurance and hang around in that 15% to 20%. Every time we do another deal there is likely a person here, another bank deal he can go do more insurance sales and so it\u2019s a really good long-term strategy, but we are not going to grow it so fast and it get downsize relative to our diversification strategy. Michael Rose : Okay, that's helpful and then as my follow-up, just going back to energy, I know it's a small piece of the portfolio and you mentioned there is no non-accruals this quarter, but did you have any negative migration and then do you have any second-lien exposure and if you do, can you quantify? Thanks. Clarke Starnes : Mike, this is Clarke. We don\u2019t have any second-lien exposure. And as Kelly said, the vast majority of what we have is senior secured reserve based credits. Very modest midstream and almost no oilfield services which is the policy exception for us. So what we did do in both the first quarter and now in the third quarter we actually did a very comprehensive stress test and looked at significant stress and prices well below where they are today. We looked at the results from the SNIK exam and the agent re-determination process and we re-graded the entire portfolio again in the third quarter. We did see a few credits go over the lots list based on that very conservative process, but, again to Kelly\u2019s point, no non-accruals at all. We feel really good about where we are and all of that\u2019s baked in to our allocated reserves and our allowance. Michael Rose : Great, I appreciate the color. Thanks for taking my questions. Clarke Starnes : No problem. Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Dan Werner with Morningstar. Dan Werner : Good morning. Could you provide some color on the percentage of cost saves that you have realized so far in the Bank of Kentucky and Susquehanna acquisitions and how we should think about that going into 2016? Daryl Bible : Yes, so, for Bank of Kentucky, we closed on that transaction in June and integration happened the same time that we closed and for the most part, all the cost have been taken out and we are pretty much what we thought we would be from that. That\u2019s pretty small a transaction. As far as Susquehanna goes, there are some cost cuts that have come out, but for the most part, you won\u2019t see big drops in their expense base until you get into the first quarter. Remember that the conversion is in November. You have to give a 60-day notice period whenever you are going to have ref individuals. So, you basically won\u2019t get big drops in FTEs until you start to see first quarter and then by second quarter of 2016, we will probably fully effected phased into 2016. So that\u2019s when you will start to see the efficiency ratio possibly impacted by those cost cuts. Dan Werner : Okay, thanks. And then as a follow-up, I know you discussed some of the opportunities with insurance. Could you discuss the opportunity relative to the National Penn acquisition? Clarke Starnes : Yes, I think, we picked up a small agency with both Susquehanna and National Penn which is unusual. We typically don\u2019t get those. So we have a real good opportunity to build around and National Penn provides us a real opportunity we think to build out of Philadelphia which would be really key to supplement our C&I business. So I think, it clearly has opportunity and we\u2019ve already had some lines in the water, but it takes time to sort of work through those opportunities. Dan Werner : Okay, thank you. Operator : The next question is from Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Nancy Bush : Good morning. Another question on insurance, Kelly, I mean, you referenced the pricing softness in the market right now several times. Can you just give us some color on that and whether you expect that this is going to persist into the fourth quarter which is a seasonally strong insurance quarter for you? Chris Henson : Nancy, this is Chris. In the US market, it is generally down about 1%. We are little heavier in property, especially with AmRisc which is CAT property. So we probably are filling it a little more along the lines of say, 2% to 3%. On the other hand, the way to outrun that is do new business production. So our new business on average is up in the \u2013 call it, 8% to 10% range. So, we actually, as Daryl commented are growing on a same-store sales basis, about 2% and in the fourth quarter, it will persist, but with the new business production and the bounce back of the seasonality we\u2019ll expect fourth quarter to pop back up 10% to 12% range over the third quarter. So we will recover the seasonality and hopefully outrun the price challenges through new production. Nancy Bush : But you see the pricing environment persisting for sometime at this point? Chris Henson : I think so. I mean, we saw in 2012 and 2013, price improvements of about 4% that built 1% to 2% last year and we are kind of that in that flat to down 1% nationally. Property seems to be catching little bit more brown over at the moment. So I think it could continue through next year. But we have in our business a couple organic opportunities that are unique in the sense of Trump Life where we actually are building a cross-sell life insurance within all the points within the bank well P&C insurance, C&I businesses. So we have really a model with a focused effort as well as through the branches. And then we have a state-of-the-art EV platform, we bought a company called Preset bank in 2012. We build what we think is state-of-the-art platform nationally and that really got up and running mid last year and we had really good momentum. So those two areas provide us a bit of a offset to the pricing as well. Kelly King : But, Nancy, one other thing to think about and I am sure you know this, but, with regard to the insurance companies which of course drives the pricing, they are very competitive like banks are in terms of pricing and all, but in my view, when this thing pivots, this is going to pivot sharply for two reasons, one is, these companies have been accreting capital but they\u2019ve also been having reductions in yields on securities. And so they are very yield-dependent on securities and so they have second win on their securities portfolio and so, pretty soon they will be pressured to get their rates up to get some decent turn on capital. And then the other thing is, they are doing what I call the insurance version of reserve releasing and they have not had any losses for a long time and so they are having reasonably good profitability because of the no losses. So you combine the fact that insurance, the yields on the securities are going down and then any kind of losses flowing because of catastrophes you are going to see them jack rates up really fast. So, what we are trying to do and Chris is doing a great job of is basically building that annuity and so we are really good at acquiring and retaining. We have one of the best native retention ratios in the business today. So actually, it didn\u2019t hit us much in the short-term. Our long-term point of view, this is a good scenario for us because rates are down, demand gets really elastic. We are able to go out and acquire more, because people are more willing to compare their services and then we are really going to keep them. So, when it does pivot, you are going to see BB&T be in a really good place. Chris Henson : And Nancy, a point I would make is, what really drives pricing is, catastrophe in the market and what we just experienced while \u2013 it\u2019s been terrible for many people in the south it will begin to turn the market. So it was directly related to what type of weather events we have in catastrophe events we have in the country. But I do think we have some organic engines, some opportunity to actually outpace and if it\u2019s down nationally 1% today we are growing 2% we are outpacing the industry by about 3%. And we think potentially as we get these organic kind of run up, we got actually some upside. Nancy Bush : And if I may just ask a quick follow-up on credit quality, Kelly, before the quarter, there were some speculation in the press that this is going to be the inflection quarter in credit quality that banks would have to begin to build reserves et cetera and we really haven\u2019t seen that in any great way. Could you just pine on your opinion on credit quality right now and when you see the turn coming? Kelly King : Nancy, I think the \u2013 I think, we have seen the bottom with regard to credit quality. We are at the bottom while some may or may not started building yet - I think in the next quarter or so you will see that, because I think, the building actually occurs as a function of when you think you are at the bottom and where they are in terms of asset ratios. But we are at the bottom, you see a little bouncing around probably in my view over the next few quarters. I don\u2019t expect quality to deteriorate substantially over the next several quarters. But, just the mathematics is that, with the bottoming, people are going to have to transition from releasing to building for growth. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have to see a lot of building for deterioration in credit quality for the next several quarters, but you will have to be because of growth. Nancy Bush : Do you guys, Kelly, see any particular importance at the 1% ratio? I mean, you are slightly above that now adjusted, but I mean, is there sort of a sacred do not break 1% that\u2019s out there with the regulators or with your own thinking? Kelly King : Well, over my career, Nancy, there was this classical sacred 1%. Of course, as you know now, we can\u2019t go into any type of order in the pre-determined idea. So we know I have no pre-determined idea of about 1% just for the record. But, it is a very mathematically driven analysis, very, very thorough \u2013 that drives every quarter. It is a practical matter whether you call it 1% or whether you call it around that area. I think you kind of can think about a floor there in my personal opinion. Clarke, would you agree with that? Clarke Starnes : I agree with that. Nancy Bush : All right, thank you. Clarke Starnes : Thanks. Operator : It appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Greer, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Alan Greer : Okay, thank you, Eric and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. This concludes our call. We hope you have a great day. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation.",

Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Alan Greer of Investor Relations for BB&T Corporation. Alan Greer : Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. Thanks to all of our listeners for joining us today. We have with us Kelly King our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Daryl Bible, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review the results for the fourth quarter. We also have other members of our executive management team who are with us to participate in the Q&A session. Chris Henson, our Chief Operating Officer; Clarke Starnes, our Chief Risk Officer; and Ricky Brown, our Community Banking President. We will be referencing a slide presentation during our comments. A copy of the presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the BB&T website. Before we begin, let me remind you that BB&T does not provide public earnings predictions or forecasts. However, there may be statements made during the course of this call that express management's intentions, beliefs or expectations. BB&T's actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the forward-looking statements in our presentation and our SEC filings. In addition, please note that our presentation includes certain non-GAAP disclosures. Please refer to page 2 in the appendix of our presentation for the appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. And now I'll turn it over to Kelly. Kelly King : Thanks, Alan. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for your interest in BB&T and as always thanks for joining our call. So, I think the fourth quarter overall for us was a very solid quarter, particularly given the challenging environment we have out there that [indiscernible] organic performance and really was a great year from a strategic point of view. So our core loan and deposit growth numbers are bit better than we expected, GAAP growth numbers included the impact of the acquisition as you all know. We grew revenues and held the net interest margin stable, which was a very comforting trend. Also, we have a very strong level of capital and liquidity. And so, overall, we continue to be a very strong company. If you focus on the quarter in terms of earnings, we made $502 million or diluted EPS of $0.64, which was flat with last quarter and we did have $50 million in pretax merger-related restructuring charges. So if you ex that we had what I call operating or core earnings of $0.68 per share excluding merger charges. If you look at GAAP ROA, it was 1.03%, return on tangible common was 13.37%, but if you adjust for the merger and restructuring charges, ROA was 1.09%, and return on tangible was 14.19%. Revenue totaled $2.6 billion, up $164 million versus the fourth quarter. That was primarily due to Susquehanna and revenue was annualized 10.8% compared to the third. So we did have strong revenue growth. Now, that did include acquisition but that's part of our business. So that's real revenue increase. For full year, we totaled $9.8 billion, including acquisitions was up 4.1% and we did have record fee income for the year. Our net interest margin, as I indicated, was stable at 3.35%, which is an important consideration. Efficiency did improve to 58.8%, as we achieved positive operating leverage. I would point out to you that we are really focused on expense management. We're working through the Susquehanna and we'll be working through the National Penn conversions, which really gives us an excellent opportunity to become more efficient, which we're absolutely committed to do. Average loans and leases held for investment totaled at $134.8 billion fourth quarter versus $130.5 billion in the third quarter. Excluding acquisitions, our average loans are a little better than we expected, growing approximately 2% annualized versus the third. Now if you take out residential mortgage, which you'll recall we are intentionally running down and continue to do that, it's up 4.5%. So pretty good loan growth quarter. Organic growth was very strong in C&I, direct, retail and equipment finance. From a strategic point of view, we're very happy that we did receive formal approval from all of regulators on National Penn and now expect to move that closing up to April 1 and we still plan to do the conversion about mid-July and so the cost saves from National Penn will still be back second half loaded because you don't really get the cost saves until the conversion. You could argue why we do merger conversion, but if you know we've done a lot of mergers for a long time and it's best to take your time and do it right rather than get in a hurry and do it wrong. So we'll get the savings by the end of the year, but it will take our time doing it. Susquehanna's going great. We did that conversion in mid-November. I will point out this is the largest conversion ever based on loan and deposit accounts. So we had 144,000 loan accounts, 790,000 deposit accounts, so it was a big deal. It's going extraordinary well. All the regions are running really, really smoothly and an early look by Ricky and his people at the combination of National Penn and Susquehanna looks really great. I mean it's frankly better than we anticipated when we announced the combination. So if you're following along on the slide, if you look at Slide 5, I'll give you a little more detail with regard to our loan growth, which, as I said, was 4.5% ex-acquisitions and ex-residential mortgage. C&I loan growth was strong, estimated core C&I loan growth was up $848 million or 7.8% annualized. That was largely layered by corporate lending and production in the branch network. C&I lending was mostly in large participations as it was in previous quarters, so it's very competitive, spreads are tight, but the spreads are flattening out. So that's a good sign. End of period balances increased $335 million, again led by large corporate. So right now looking forward for the next quarter, we expect C&I to continue to grow. It could be a little slower depending on strengthened manufacture. I want to particularly point out to you that our oil and gas portfolio is not large for our company. It's $1.4 billion outstanding, which is about 1% of our portfolio. It's very conservative portfolio, 67% is upstream, 30% is midstream and we only have about 3% in support services. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had no delinquencies, no losses, and we have no energy loans or non-accrual. So, I know there's been a lot written and talked about energy, but energy is just not a negative story for us. It's a good, solid story. And we don't anticipate any major problems in that area. Obviously, if oil goes to extreme lows, we'll have some challenges, but because of the absolute size of this business is small, we just do not anticipate that to be a big issue for BB&T. End of day, we still have an area with a very strong quarter, up $108 million, about 40% annualized. That's really being driven by new markets that we're adding, some new lines we're offering and we expect it to continue to grow, although probably not at quite that pace. In CRE construction and development, we increased 1.6% annualized in the quarter. Excluding acquisitions, end of period balances did decline a bit. We expect C&D growth to become seasonally soft until the spring. CRE income producing increased 2.5% annualized, excluding acquisitions. That was mostly broad-based, office, hospitality, industrial. The market fundamentals in those spaces continues to improve, although spreads continue to tighten. And so looking at next quarter, we expect core IPP to slow and to really be about flat, mostly because of the competitive pricing and we're just not -- we'll just not try to book loan just to -- book loan into prices that's not acceptable, we just rather not have them. Average direct retail lending is a really good story for us, increasing $237 million, almost 11% annualized due to our HELOC portfolio, direct lending, auto lending in the branches. Our wealth division is doing great, producing about 30% of our retail volume. It's just a really good story. We have really good momentum heading into the first quarter. Might be a little bit slow just because it's seasonal, but underlying strategic direction in that portfolio has strong momentum as we look forward. And if you look at sales finance on the other hand, it did decline $406 million or 17.5%. That was very consistent with our strategies. We simply are unwilling to participate in the tighter spread market that exists in that space. With increased capital that is required today just simply does not make sense to book loans where there's not a reasonable risk adjusted return on capital. So we've been very careful and judicious in looking at the kind of assets we're willing to book, and right now sales finance is just not a particularly profitable area. That doesn't mean we're getting out of the business. We are restructuring the business, however, you heard us say it recently. We've now implemented a flat rate compensation program for our dealers and we're watching the spreads carefully. I would point out that we did pick up a portfolio called the Hahn Auto Leasing business from Susquehanna, which we are exiting as we don't choose to do auto leasing. And so that will be winding down. That will be a little bit of a negative impact, but it won't affect our fundamental strategies. Average residential mortgage that like you've been hearing from everybody was down 5.9% linked quarter annualized. We are selling all of our conforming production and originations were 30% lower than the third quarter, of course that was largely seasonal. So we expect to see applications continuing to be soft as we head through the winter months. Gain on sales was down about 5%. Our correspondent channel lately shifted to 55%. So there's lot of moving parts in the mortgage business today. The whole [indiscernible] disclosure program is definitely slowing down production and booking of transactions. It's hard to know what the underlying issues are in terms of consumer preferences, in terms of millennials, et cetera, choosing to own homes or not. Personally, I think, it's a little bit early to call all of that. What we do know right now though is that mortgage production is down and part of that is substantially because of the mortgage disclosures that takes just a long, long time. I would point out on a very positive note that overall the community bank loan production is really accelerating, it's the best it's been in years. Our commercial production's up 16.7%, retail's up 44% compared to the last fourth quarter and that momentum will continue as we head into the first and second quarters. Other lending subsidiaries grew $227 million or 7.3%. That's a good number. It's actually a little seasonally weaker though because of seasonality [indiscernible]. Strongest ones in this area was Grandbridge, equipment finance and Regional Acceptance. With respect to the first quarter, again seasonally slower, but good in terms of the long-term strategies in those portfolios. So to sum up, we expect average loans held for investment to be up modestly, about 1% in the first quarter with continued pressure given seasonality in our seasonal portfolios. Just a comment with regard to the overall economy, because that obviously impacts the loan production. There's been a lot written and said over the last few weeks about the issues in the stock market. We believe there's a lot of overreaction going on. It's like you woke up January 2nd, all of a sudden everybody decided the world's falling apart and we reject that. We don't see any fundamental structural changes between the first part of December and the first part of January. The world just doesn't happen that fast. Obviously a huge confluence of negative psychology going on, but we're trying to look past that. So what we focus on is the fact that yes, oil is down and that is a factor in terms of the oil space, but oil is overall really stimulative. It's stimulative to consumers. It's stimulative to businesses. It's stimulative to airlines. Oil is stimulative. The strong dollar has other implications, but in terms of consumer purchases it's stimulative because obviously imports are a lot cheaper. And so what we would say is that it's not a bullish environment it's no different from what we talked about the last two, three quarters. The economy's growing at 2%, 2.25% kind of growth rate, which is not great but it's not falling. I would say for all of those pundits that are saying the sky is falling we would respectfully disagree with that. So, if you look at our Slide 6, just a comment or two on deposits, continues to be a good story for us. Our non-interest deposits increased $1.7 billion or 15% annualized. That doesn't include acquisitions. If you take out acquisitions, total deposits were about flat by design, but non-interest bearing deposits grew 7.5%, which was very good. So, we're doing a really good job in improving our mix and reducing our cost. Ex Susquehanna our non-interest bearing deposit. Costs remain low at 24 basis points. I will point now on a very bright note that we introduced in the fourth quarter our new U digital mobile online platform. It is doing extraordinarily well. We now have over 650,000 users and it is gaining momentum as we go forward. We believe it is the best integrated platform in the business today and is certainly a big driver of our new account production today. So, overall, we feel really great about our deposit performance. We feel really good about our digital strategy and while there's plenty to do we believe we will stand out as a real positive performer in the whole digital space as we go forward. So, now with that I'll ask Daryl to give you some more detail and then I'll summarize after that. Daryl Bible : Thank you, Kelly and good morning everyone. Today I'm going to talk about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, non-interest expense, capital and our segment results. Turning to Slide 7. Our credit quality remains very strong. Loans 90 days or more past due declined $69 million, mostly driven by loans acquired from the FDIC and impaired loans. Loans 30 to 89 past due increased 13%, mostly because we conformed Susquehanna's delinquencies to our more conservative methodology. We also had some seasonal growth, which is typical for the fourth quarter. NPAs declined 4.3%, mostly because of the sale of non-performing residential mortgage loans. This was offset by a more conservative approach for determining non-accrual status for mortgage loans in HELOCs. Excluding the loan sale, NPAs were essentially flat compared to last quarter. Net charge-offs increased slightly to 38 basis points in the quarter, led by higher charge-offs at regional acceptance. The increase at regional was due to seasonality, declining small car values and regional's Texas exposure. Regional accounted for about half of the total charge-offs. Overall, we are very pleased with credit quality. Looking forward, we expect NPAs to remain in a similar range in the first quarter next year. We expect charge-offs to be in the range of 35 basis points to 45 basis points. Continuing on Slide 8. Our allowance coverage ratios remain strong at 2.83 times for charge-offs and 2.53 times for NPLs. The allowance to loan ratios was 1.07%, compared to 1.08% last quarter. Remember, all of our acquired loans have a combined mark of about $750 million from all of our acquisitions. So the effective allowance coverage is significantly higher. We recorded a provision of $129 million for the quarter compared to net charge-offs of $130 million. As Kelly mentioned earlier, we have a very clean and conservative energy portfolio that's about 1% of our loan portfolio or $1.4 billion. The allowance coverage for these loans is approximately 5% given the stress in the sector. Turning to Slide 9. Net interest margin was 3.35%, flat compared to third quarter and in line with our guidance. Core margin was 3.12%, down 3 basis points. Both GAAP and core margin were impacted by larger balances at the Fed for the majority of the quarter and lower loan yields. We expect GAAP and core margin to increase modestly in the first quarter, due to higher rates on earning assets, driven by recent rate increase, lower Fed balances, and the ability to lag deposit rates. We became slightly less asset sensitive this quarter, mostly due to investment and funding mix changes. As you can see, we will continue to benefit from additional rate hikes. Continuing on Slide 10. Fee income for the year was a new record. Our fee income ratio was 41.8% for the quarter. Looking at a few components of fee income. Insurance income increased $26 million for 29% annualized, mostly due to seasonal factors. Investment banking and brokerage experienced a decline of $14 million, mostly due to higher capital markets activity last quarter. Mortgage banking income decreased $7 million, mostly due to lower gain on sale of loans and lower saleable production offset by better commercial mortgage income. Other income increased $15 million, due to $25 million higher income related to assets of certain post employment benefits and $12 million in the client derivative income, offset by a $20 million decrease in partnership and other investment income. Non-interest income should increase modestly next quarter. This will be led by stronger insurance and investment banking revenues with lower mortgage and service charge income. Turning to Slide 11. Non-interest expenses totaled $1.6 billion, essentially flat from last quarter. Personnel expense increased $11 million, driven by higher salary expenses from Susquehanna. In addition, we had some offsetting expenses with higher post employment benefit expense and lower medical and retirement cost. Average FTEs were up just a bit over 1,000 due to Susquehanna. Excluding acquisitions, FTEs remained flat. Occupancy and equipment expense increased $9 million, mostly due to acquisitions.  Merger related and restructuring charges totaled $50 million. We do not expect a material amount of merger related costs next quarter. Our effective tax rate was 31.7% and we expect a similar rate next quarter. Non-interest expense should be flat on a GAAP basis next quarter, as we lower our merger related charges will be offset by seasonally higher FICA and employee. We are confident we will achieve the cost saves from our acquisitions. We also expect to improve of efficiency throughout 2016 with fourth quarter efficiency ratio around 56% to 57%. Turning to Slide 12. Capital ratios remain very strong with Common Equity Tier 1 of 10.2%. Fully phased in Common Equity Tier 1 increased to 10%. Our LCR decreased to 130 and our asset liquid buffer at the end of the quarter was very strong at 13.5%. Let's look at some segment results, beginning on Slide 13. Community Bank's net income was up $9 million from last quarter and up $22 million from the fourth quarter of last year. This was driven by commercial lending, retail lending and deposits, as well as higher funding spreads on deposits, partially offset by lower rates on new commercial loans. Net interest income increased $87 million with about half of that driven by Susquehanna. Finally, with all the regulatory approvals we received for the planned acquisition of national Penn, we expect to close on April 1st with a third quarter systems conversion. Turning to Slide 14. Residential mortgage banking net income totaled $49 million, down $10 million from after quarter, driven by lower gain on mortgage loan production, partially offset by increasing net servicing income. Gain on sale spreads dropped slightly to 103 and 58% of our production mix was purchase. Looking at Slide 15. Dealer Financial Services income totaled $42 million, down $2 million from last quarter. The provision was up due to higher charge-offs in dealer finance and regional acceptance. Turning to Slide 16. Specialized lending net income totaled $71 million, up $2 million from last quarter, driven by higher commercial mortgage income and leasing income. Looking at Slide 17. Insurance services net income totaled $36 million, up $15 million from last quarter, mostly driven by a seasonal increase in commercial property and casualty insurance and higher life commissions, due to seasonality and improved production. Year-to-date same store sales achieved about 1% growth as the market for insurance pricing is softer.  Turning to Slide 18. Financial services segment had $103 million in net income, up $21 million from last quarter. Corporate banking generated significant loan growth of 30%. Wealth experienced 16% loan growth and 21% growth in transaction deposits. Non-interest income decreased $10 million linked quarter due to lower SBIC partnership income and investment advisory fees. In summary, we achieved broad-based loan growth and revenue growth due to Susquehanna, continued excellent credit quality and positive operating leverage. We look forward to executing on the opportunities with our merger partners in the coming quarters. Now let me turn it back over to Kelly for closing remarks and Q&A. Kelly King : Thank you, Daryl. So in summarizing, again, we did have a solid quarter, good loan and deposit growth, real momentum in the Community Bank, stable margins as Daryl described, excellent credit quality, strong capital, strong liquidity, acquisitions give us a real opportunity in terms of cost saves and revenue enhancement as we go forward, and while we don't think the economy's tanking, we don't think it's going to be super robust either. It's kind of a slow, steady as you go activity. But even so we have huge opportunities in new markets, in new product penetrations, though. Overall, a good quarter and we think we have a decent momentum as we head forward into the first. So, with that we'll turn it over to Alan for Q&A. Alan Greer : Thank you, Kelly. Robert, if you would come back on the line now and explain how our listeners may participate in the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Kelly King : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : I just had a question on loan growth and on reserves. On loan growth, I saw your commentary on the outlook for 1Q, but maybe you could give us a sense as to how you're thinking about the loan book over the course of the year, given the fact that you just made one acquisition or are about to make another one, wanted to get your sense of how you're planning on driving loan growth on a core level, as well as through the acquisitions. Kelly King : Thanks, Betsy. I'll give you and then ask Rick to comment on this. I feel relative to the economy, I feel pretty good. This combination of Susquehanna and National Penn giving us the number four market share in Pennsylvania is a real opportunity for us. We are further along in those two mergers than we've been in any mergers we\u2019ve ever done that I can recall. And Pennsylvania is a really good market, a nice, diversified market between Philadelphia and the Lancaster area. So, it's our kind of area. So, we feel good about that. Florida is doing really, really well now. Texas is having a little bit of a dampening effect because of energy. But you know energy is only about 10% of the overall impact. So, I tell people, you say Texas was increasing by 1,000 people a day, so now maybe it's down to 850. Texas is still doing really well. And we have such tiny shareholder, whilst I think it's going to be relative to the economy a pretty good loan year for us. Ricky would you comment on that. Ricky Brown : Yeah Kelly, I would say that we are pretty well positioned in Pennsylvania. We think that will be an opportunity. Obviously in new markets you've got to stabilize, build your brand, get your sales culture in place, but we feel very positive about that. From a core perspective we're seeing really strong growth in Texas. I would support that Texas is not just all oil. To be sure, but there's a lot of other things. We've been pleased with our loan growth in the Texas market. Florida across the whole state has rebounded. We've seen really solid growth in the state of Florida. We've got opportunities to grow our ABL business. We're looking really closely at how we make that more effective. We're pleased with growth in small commercial and small business with the strategies that we've been employed. We'll be careful with CRE. You\u2019ve heard Kelly talk about that and we've got to be careful with pricing. We've got to be careful with risk. But, the last two quarters in the third and the fourth, Community Bank growth on a linked basis has been the best it's been in probably five, six or seven years. Production as Kelly said is up. Our activity levels are good. I would not say that means that we think the economy's doing outstandingly well. We just are grinding it out, finding opportunities. Our guys are working really, really hard and I feel good about where we are and as we go into 2016 I feel as good about making our loan growth goals in the Community Bank in terms of where we've been over the last several years than any of those years many I feel really good about where we are. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks for the color. Just wanted to have the follow-up on the allowance. Daryl, in the past I think you've mentioned wanted to make sure the ALR ratio doesn't go below 1% and I know you called out the marks that you've got. So, are you thinking about the ALR as the 107 print or are you embedding in your thoughts the marks that you've got? Daryl Bible : It really includes both. When we go through the model, Betsy, every quarter we go through an analysis that look at how the loans are rated and how they're going to perform and what the embedded losses are and the marks are part of the embedded losses and what's on balance sheet. So, I think we feel very good about our current allowance level. As we said in the last couple quarters, as we grow our balance sheet we're going to continue to have to provide for loan growth, which means we're going to have to get paid for incremental growth from that perspective. So, I would expect the provision unless something changes materially to be basically charge-offs, plus also coverage for loan growth going forward. Betsy Graseck : Okay. So some reserve build related to loan growth. Daryl Bible : Correct. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning, Kelly, good morning, Daryl. Kelly King : Good morning. Daryl Bible : Hey, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Coming back to the commercial real estate comments that you guys just made, can you share with us some of the underwriting concerns that you have? And can you relate that at all to what the regulators came out with recently about their concerns about underwriting standards in commercial real estate? Daryl Bible : I'll make a comment, Gerard, then let Clark give you much more color. We've said for several quarters as you know that the competition in the whole at CRE space has been very difficult. And that's been really low cap rates being used and high advance rates. And so we've maintained our steady conservative underwriting. For example, everybody's underwriting on these low cap rates. We underwrite on long term expected normal cap rates and that makes a big difference, how much you advance. So, we look at a lot of deals, we don't get them, but we're fine with that. We're just not going to violate our risk appetite to get volume in that space. But Clarke you could add some color on to that. Clarke Starnes : Yeah Gerard, you've seen recently the regulators sent back out all the historical interagency guidance around CRE, which is clearly a signal that they think that it's moving a little too fast right you now. We see and hear most about multifamily concern about just the sheer number of continued starts or units in pipeline. At some point that's going to outstrip certainly the [indiscernible] markets in balance today and fundamentals look really good. We are seeing some markets where rents are as high as home ownership. You're seeing some of that again, but we're seeing underwriting things like lenders underwriting off these low cap rates looking at pro forma trended rents that are above market, really low vacancy, et cetera, et cetera, and certainly the regulators are just asking everyone to go back to the fundamentals in which Kelly described well for us, which we look very much at the cash flow and not so much just the low cap rate environment that we've been in the last few years. Gerard Cassidy : Can you guys give us a flavor on the cap rates that you both addressed, what you're using versus what you're seeing in the marketplace? Kelly King : So for example, probably the most aggressive - you're seeing cap rates in the multifamily space in the 4 to 5.5 range rate properties, office would be in the 5.75 to 7.75 retail, down as low with 6, industrials low as 550, hospitality down to 6. And so again, we don't underwrite merely on the cap rate. We're going to look at a stressed cash flow coverage and we're going to look at existing market rents and we're not going to look at those pro forma escalations and we're going to look at stress exits. So, a lot of lenders are lending against that really low cap rate. So, it looks like you've got a lot of equity in the deal, but it's really probably over-financed. So, our loans would typically have less proceeds, given our approach. Gerard Cassidy : Great. And Kelly, to come back to your comments about your digital channel, that as rolled out successfully. Can you give us some color if you look at it over the next two to three years, is this going to impact the number of branches that you need. Do you see your branch count falling or shrinking in size, the individual branches? And then second, do you have any metrics on the cost savings that if you steer somebody into this digital channel rather than using a teller for a transaction, what kind of cost savings you guys are seeing? Kelly King : Let me give you an overview. Gerard and Ricky can give you more detail. [indiscernible] What we've said, even though U is extremely successful and that will be true for the industry. We're clearly seeing transactions slowly, methodically reducing in the branches. And at the same time though when you talk to Xers and Yers and the lineal\u2019s they will still tell you that one of the top two preference items in terms of selecting a bank is the convenience of a branch. Fact is, people still want to be able to go into a branch and see somebody to have a complex product or have a problem and there is a little bit of just pure psychology that we\u2019re eyed by the branch and that\u2019s where are money is and it makes me feel good. SO, you are not going to see a dramatic change in the number of branch, but you will see an increasing focus on the size of the branches, the structures, the staffing in the branches and all of that will help to relatively reduce our cost as we shift more into the digital platform. But Ricky, you could give a bit more color on that. Ricky Brown : Yeah. So, let me just talk about the branches just a little bit. We've been on a very methodical long-term pruning of our branch system. We've not had any real major branch reductions other than one time several years ago, but we constantly look at our branches, we look at underperforming branches. We look at opportunities to consolidate branches. So, we're all over that. Secondly, we've been on a pretty steady path of reducing headcount in our branches in response to less transactions in the branches. So, we are already running pretty all gone lean in our branches today. We're also believing that the folks in the branches need to know more, do more, so this sort of universal concept, something we're embracing and moving forward on so that lesser people, better people, better enabled people can do more for our clients. And what we're finding is our associates like it because they feel better armed to take care of client needs and it also creates savings for us. So this is an evolutionary process. I don't view it as a revolutionary process. We have to continue to bon top of it. We are seeing clearly reduction of branch transactions, it\u2019s steady. It continues to be. It's not gone over a cliff. Branches still are important. They're part of our branding. They're part of the convenience that we have to have. They're part of the omnichannel development. So it's about having you, but it is also about having good branches. It's about having great ATMs. It's about having a great call center, it is about having a great experience 24 hours a day, seven days a week and that's what we're trying to put together at BB&T. A lot of focus on digital and the U platform is we think unique and different and it's got lots of accolades. Kelly mentioned over 650,000 users, the last number that just came out yesterday was over 700,000 users. The positive impact from our associates, the feedback from our clients is all very, very good. Now, to get to the cost of transactions, we have not really done that to say what if a transaction's done in U, what did it say? There's no question, self service would save money, no doubt about that. But overall, what we find is we can get somebody to do U, we think they're going to do more at the branch. We think they're going to do more at call center, they are going to do more across all of our platforms and so at the end of the day that gives us a better chance to have a bigger share of wallet, better referrals from them and ultimately drive the revenue, while overall aspects around cost reduction, ultimately leads to positive operating leverage in the branch that's what we're trying to achieve. Kelly King : I know it sounds comical, this is a very important question for us and others. So, if you take a portfolio of clients as those clients move to more mobile digital technology and as Ricky continues to downsize to 5 and the number of staff in the branches. There is no question in my mind than to aggregate net cost to that portfolio of clients goes down. That's a big deal for the industry. [indiscernible] 10 years or 15 years for it to phase out, but it is a big positive trend for our industry. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : And we will take our next question from Paul Miller with FBR Capital. Paul Miller : Yeah, thank you very much, guys. On the insurance line, I know you sold some \u2013 it looks like we were a little bit overestimating that insurance. I don't think we were completely factoring in some of the insurance sales. How should we look at that going forward? Is this a good run rate on a seasonality basis, what you guys did in the third and fourth quarter? Chris Henson : Well, this is Chris. We were a little lighter in the fourth quarter, primarily because we've got really, we got a soft market, really cranked up in the fall. So, average P&C prices today are down about 4%. We might be a little heavier in that us because we're heavier in property. But our new business growth has been, given the market, really good, up north of say 3% to 4%. So, on average, if you kind of look at like, look at same store sales when you pull out acquisitions, et cetera, we're up about 1.5% or so. We think this next year with sort of run rate and growth, we think potential acquisitions, we think we could be up in say the 3%, 4% kind of range. Next quarter, probably up in the 10% sort of range. And there's less volatility. We still have volatility from quarter-to-quarter, but there's becoming less volatility. We think first quarter's certainly become one of our stronger quarters, first and second, second could be a little stronger than first quarter, but pretty much similar run rates I would say. Paul Miller : And can you just add real quick color on why pricing was soft in the second half of the year? Chris Henson : Yeah, what you've got in the general market is a lot of overcapacity. We just have not had huge catastrophes to sort of eat up the capital. So, you've got retailers which the standard underwriters are just sort of bidding each other up for price and they're trying to take deals from the next guy. So you got pricing on the retail side falling rather substantially. We're the second largest wholesaler. We try to keep about half of our business in retail, half in wholesale for this he very reason, because generally when retail is struggling, wholesale is a bit better. We're seeing pricing actually hold up in wholesale P&C pretty well today and we as you know being the second largest, we've got pretty good efficiencies. On the Amber side, which is more of an MGA, specific sort of wind cat underwriter, you've got deep, discounted price. We've been able to make it up for the most part with volume in terms of the bottom line. It's really all about overcapacity in the market and each other really kind of competing heavy on price. That all rectifies when you have a catastrophe. It sort of flips the other way then. Kelly King : But keep in mind one of the really positives about our insurance strategy is as you grow your client base better than the market, which we're doing, as you have a high retention rate better than the market, which we're doing, you're building in basically the way I think about it is a really positive annuity story. Because, best I can tell catastrophes will probably continue to have for since the creation of the earth, so I think it probably will continue. And so when they occur, premiums will go up. Premiums will go up, our commissions go up with virtually no increase in our cost structure. So, it's not there today, but it will be there. Chris Henson : And I think Kelly's right. I mean our retention which is the amount of existing business you retain at renewal is about 93%. We think the peers are probably in the upper 80s, mid to upper 80s. So, we think we clearly are advantaged there. The other thing with the pricing market, in early 2000s, used to have huge volatility. You had up 30%. I think in 2007, we might have been down in the mid-teens. Today, you see much less volatility. They might be up and down 6% or 7% because they have much better forecasting models to determine losses. So, it\u2019s within a much tighter range. Paul Miller : Okay guys. Thank you very much. Operator : We will take our next question from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Good morning. Kelly King : Good morning. Daryl Bible : Good morning. John Pancari : On the loan growth side, I know you mentioned that you saw some impact from manufacturing sluggishness there. So, I guess if you can give us a little bit of color about what you're seeing in manufacturing and how that's impacting growth. If you could just give us a little more color there, thanks. Clarke Starnes : Hey, John, this is Clarke. We haven't seen it substantially impact growth yet. I would say the early signals that we've seen out of that is mostly when we look at large Company manufacturers or exporters. Their sales are softer. Their margins are down. Profitability is strained a bit. But we've not seen that necessarily translate yet into slower overall demand in the market. So, it's been more of just a subtle signals as we continue to analyze the credits. Kelly King : So our comment was really saying that looking forward if there's a substantial decline in manufacturing that would impact loan growth. Operator : John. John Pancari : Sorry about that. On the pricing side, wanted to see if the widening spreads at all, if that - you're seeing in the market, if that has helped - given you any relief on the pricing side at all? And then separately, when we look at your loan growth and I know you've commented on the pricing competition a couple times being a factor, normally you're in that 5% to 6% total loan growth range. You're running right now a little bit below that. Should we expect that you're looking at more like a 4% annual range as we move through the full year, mainly given these headwinds? Daryl Bible : John, I think the way we look at it, you heard us say this before, it's probably what GDP is plus 1% or 2%. Our estimate and what our plan has is loan growth in the 3% to 4% range next year. But there's a lot of volatility right now. But that's what we have in our plan. As far as loan spreads linked quarter, versus third versus fourth, C&I was pretty much stable. A little bit of deterioration in CRE. Pretty stable in C&I and on the consumer side sales finance as Kelly mentioned in his earlier comments really well, but flat, about 1% on prime indirect auto, which is one of the reasons why we're shrinking that portfolio. And the bright spot is in Ricky's growth, a direct retail, we have strong growth in retail and our spreads are continuing to widen. We're up about 10 basis points, 15 basis points in that sector. John Pancari : Okay. And then one last one from me, going back to Paul's line of questioning around insurance, just to reconfirm, that 7% decline year-over-year in your insurance revenue, would you say that's all attributable to pricing? Kelly King : No, no, no. Remember, June 1st we sold American Coastal and so we had - that business was worth to us about $145 million in revenue. So, we had in say the first five months of the year, we had in about $53 million or so and then from June 1 on we would have lost about $92 million in revenue. So it's really relative to selling. And when you look back at our common quarter comparison for this quarter versus fourth 2014, that's pretty much all American Coastal. If you pull out American Coastal, we're in fact up a couple of percent. So it has to do with the sale of American Coastal. John Pancari : Got it. Got it. Kelly King : And remember, the American Coastal sale was not a net negative. We diversified. We reduced our risk. We reinvested that money in and risk and produced more stable, more profitable margin business in that area. So it was a net positive to us, but it shows a negative on the revenue line. Daryl Bible : In fact, I would even say we invested in a higher margin business. At the end of the day, it should drive more profitability. John Pancari : Okay. So barring that noise and barring the pricing pressure, there's nothing structurally about your insurance business that's a drag on the revenue at all? Kelly King : I'd say quite the opposite. We're outrunning the market. The market's down 4%, we're up 1.5% on same store sales when you pull out acquisitions. What you're seeing in the number is all American Coastal related. John Pancari : Got it. All right. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Matt Burnell : Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking my question. Kelly, maybe a question for you in terms of capital distribution. With your dividend payout at or maybe slightly above the 30% levels as we calculate it, I know how important dividends are to you relative to your investor base. I guess I'm curious how you're thinking about potentially increasing the dividend in 2016 and 2017 and any color you can provide on how you and the board are thinking about buybacks would be helpful. Thank. Kelly King : Nothing's really changed in terms of our capital deployment strategy. As you know, we made it very clear that capital should first be allocated to organic growth and second to dividends and third to M&A and fourth to buybacks. So nothing's changed about that. Nothing's likely to change about that. These are long-term concepts that we run our business by. So you would expect to see us think about kind of a steady relatively positive increase in the dividend. You would expect to see us hold our total capital request for deployment to the low side of what a lot of people do, because we are committed to keeping a relatively strong capital position. And keep in mind, there is a big issue out there yet to be determined that is around the counter cyclical buffer. Not many people are talking about it, but that is a potential increase in capital. And so we're going to be conservative so that we don't end up having to go get capital a at a time when it's not market friendly. So given all of that, I would you say that you will see our performance in 2016 kind of look like 2015. Whether we do specific buybacks or not, as always it will be a function of whether or not we have acquisition opportunities that allows us to use up that extra capital like we have done in the last couple of years. And a function of what our price is. We're simply not going to go out and buy back stock when the price is high and it produces us negative internal rate of return for our existing shareholders. Matt Burnell : Okay. Thanks, Kelly. That makes sense. And Clark, maybe a question, a theoretical question for you relative to energy. I appreciate BB&T's portfolio is below your peers in terms of your loan exposure, but in terms of how you're thinking about the trend in non-performing or criticized assets relative to losses, how do you think about provisioning against a prolonged period of low oil prices and how does that dovetail with the idea of losses because the collateral you hold against those exposures being a lot lower than potential provisions? Clarke Starnes : That's a good question, Matt. Obviously, just like everyone else, we are monitoring the oil and gas exposure daily and redoing our price decks and looking at the sensitivities and stressing accordingly and we're going down right now to at $20 or below in our stress case. So my biggest concern is that while we believe even down pretty low, we've got very strong asset coverage and our PV9s look good. I don't think even at low rates we fundamentally have a lot of loss exposure. I'm more concerned about this time around, there's a lot of layered bond debt behind the senior secured lenders. And traditionally that was not the case. And so what could happen this time if it stayed down long and low, it could cause a lot of non-accrual risk as you try to work through all that layered debt. And that could cause you to have to work through and consider discounts or losses beyond the collateral coverage you normally see. So we're trying to think about all of that and take a conservative view of loss given default, even if we've got good collateral coverage view right now. We're trying to make sure we stay ahead of that. I think our 5% reserve, given the quality of our portfolio, is very, very prudent and it takes those kinds of things into consideration. Matt Burnell : And just so we're clear, Clark, what's your expectation if oil does stay at the $20 level of potential additional losses or if you want to think about it this way, reserving? Clarke Starnes : The true answer is no one really knows. It's all an estimate. And everybody has different opinions. But we have done work in our sensitivity, in our allowance process, and even down to a $20 level that in an ago aggregate basis we have asset coverage. And even if you look at the cash flows, discount that, we think it would not be material. Certainly, if it continues to stay down we would have to put more on the watch list potentially move some to non-accrual and a provision accordingly, but even with all that, we don't think it's a material number at this time. Kelly King : And keep in mind, when you're doing reserve based lending, the fact that price goes down doesn't mean that they are all automatically evaporated. The oil's still there. The gas is still there. And so while you may have an extended period of time at lower prices, the cash flow and payoff the loan, the odds of losses in that kind of scenario is still extremely low. Matt Burnell : Okay. Thanks for your color, guys. Operator : And we will take our next question from Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Good morning. My first question dovetails a little bit on the capital planning question. Kelly, clearly the earnings outlook for the industry, particularly those that don't have your scale, has been ratcheted lower even in these past couple of weeks and I'm wondering what your appetite is in terms of taking advantage of that lower earnings outlook and the decline in stock prices as you think about more acquisitions in 2016. Kelly King : Well, Erica, I think your question is insightful. I think the longer the challenging environment persists, particularly in some spaces, maybe like in the energy space, it's certainly putting disproportionate amount of pressure on certain companies. And to the extent that it lasts a while, it certainly could cause them to re-evaluate their strategic thinking going forward. So we remain from a long-term point of view committed to our acquisition strategy. Recall that it is to grow on an average basis 5% to 10% of our assets. And that's an area you could see the probability increase of potential partners that might be interested. So it always comes down to two things. Well, three things. It comes down to a cultural shift, but we don't really talk to people that are cultural fit. And then it comes down to their willingness to combine and then it's just mathematics. So to the extent that they are more challenged and that changes their appetite to consider strategic combination and to the extent that our performance does better and our price does better, that would enhance the possibility of us being a able to do combinations. Erika Najarian : Got it. And just my second question is for Daryl. I just wanted to make sure I understood. The 56% to 57% efficiency ratio guide was for 1Q and I guess the follow-up to that is a lot of investors are now starting to strip further interest increases out of their model. You don't seem to be as pessimistic. But could you deliver continued improvement in your core efficiency if the Fed is indeed one and done? Daryl Bible : So, Erica, in my opening comments, we said that our efficiency ratio throughout 2016 would continue to improve and by the fourth quarter of 2016, we would have an efficiency in the range of 56% to 57%. When we put together our operating plan for 2016 a couple of months ago, we were very conservative and looks like we were at least based upon the futures now on target. But we've only embedded the December rate hike that we got in the plan until we get to the fourth quarter of 2016 and then I think in November, December timeframe we have another rise. So we basically have interest rates flat for 10 months of the year in 2016. We didn't have any more rate increases factored in when we came up with our operating plan and with these efficiency targets. Erika Najarian : Got it. Sorry. Missed that. Thank you. Kelly King : You're welcome. Operator : We will take our next question from Michael Rose with Raymond James. Michael Rose : Actually, Erica, just asked my questions. Thanks. Operator : And we will go next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Amanda Larsen : Hi, this is Amanda Larsen on for Ken. Is your outlook for NII to grow 12% to 14% year-over-year in 2016 factoring in the forward curve, is that still intact given the Expedited and PBC closure versus your expectations last year? Kelly King : Big picture wise, I would tell you that excluding acquisitions, both the benefit we get from Susquehanna and National Penn, we feel very good that we can grow NII year-over-year from 2015 and 2016. That number is probably in the $150 million to $200 million range. With the acquisitions that the NII grow significantly more than that, just because we have a bigger balance sheet, higher earning assets. But this is the first year in a long time where we basically feel core is stabilized and potentially starting go up. We're going to grow our loan book and we're going to grow organic core NII in 2016. Amanda Larsen : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Marty Mosby : Daryl, I wanted to ask you about the deposit beta assumptions that you've incorporated into your asset sensitivity estimates. Daryl Bible : Okay. They really haven't changed for a couple years. So when we show our sensitivities, Marty, in an up 200 scenario, we have all of our deposit betas averaging around 60%. What we have seen to date -- so we've had a rate rise increase in December. We've had and we're projecting an outlook of positive margin in the first quarter of a couple basis points, it's really dependent on how successful we are and what the market does on how deposit rates change. I think we feel very good up 2 or 3 basis points in margin and we'll see if it's any better than that, depending on deposit line. Marty Mosby : I did know your 60%, the actual performance so far hasn't been anywhere close to that. So when you're looking at this estimate, if you bring that down, how far do these numbers go up if you assume 10% or 20% deposit beta. Daryl Bible : I would say -- I can give you a range and kind of bracket it because it's probably in between the range. I would say that our margin will be up 2 to 3 in the lower end and maybe double that, 4 to 6, on the higher end depending on how we have to adjust deposit prices. The retail deposit rates are pretty static. Commercial has been inching up a little bit. But it really depends on how things play out and it's probably not going to be the same deposit beta for all the rate increases. We're going to have lower deposit betas in the first couple of rate increases and as rates continue to rise, you're going to have probably faster deposit beta. So it's going to be very fluid and very dynamic going forward. Marty Mosby : Two to three times better performance if the deposit beta, especially on the first couple of rate rises is much better than what was incorporated here. And then the other thing I was going to ask as a follow-up is what really matters then is the asset yields and how they can go up. I was looking at the -- what would be prime or LIBOR based lending that you can see right on the income statement, construction lending or revolving credit. Those rates went up like you would expect even with only two weeks of the rate rise. The one line item that you can't really see very well is C&I, which is the one that really matters. How much of those loans are embedded there or tied to LIBOR or prime and would be impacted by the short-term rates? Daryl Bible : Yeah, so we had about $70 billion of loans that are tied to LIBOR and prime. I think it's about $50 billion LIBOR and about $20 billion in prime. You are right in that the majority of the LIBOR does move fairly quickly. Some of it immediate, some first of the month, but prime tends to move first of the month or quarterly so there's a little bit of lag. So even though rates rose in the middle of December, we still have not received the full benefit of all of our assets repricing and we're in the middle of January. It probably takes a good full two months, maybe three months before all the assets are going to be positively impacted. Marty Mosby : All right, thanks. Operator : We do have time for one more question. We will go next to Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Nancy Bush : Good morning. I have a funding question and it's kind of tags onto Marty's question. In past cycles you guys have been big issuers of CDs. Some of your funding has been more CD dependent in past years and then you sort of backed away from CDs. What's the sort of CD philosophy going into the rate rise cycle? It seems that you are already doing some CD specials in some markets and I just wanted to see how your CD funding philosophy may have changed. Kelly King : Nancy, as well as you know, our company, you'll recall that our company was built with a lot of mergers of small community banks and thrifts that had a huge portion of their funding from CDs. And so as we layer in these acquisitions, we're constantly in a process of rationalizing those deposit structures because a good portion of those CD portfolios that we inherit each time are really, really price sensitive portfolios. And as we bring the pricing more in line with our normal pricing, a fair amount of those CD portfolios tend to exit. So that's why you've seen a kind of relative decline in CD financing over the last few years. You'll see some more of that as we think through Susquehanna, National Penn, although the price variation for them is not as different as it had been, some of our acquisitions in the past. We think CDs are a necessary and important part of our ongoing funding structure. There's a portion of that portfolio that is kind of core bread and butter, fully committed clients that we always keep. And we're willing to pay a little more to keep those because they're long-term, stable uses of our services. On the other hand, you always have the one that's are single service clients and they're shopping 15 banks and going to the one that has the highest basis point CD and we don't tend to keep those. So I suspect as rates go up, you will see our CD portfolio increase some, but it won't be as dramatic as you may think because we are growing our DDA and other funding sources at a very fast pace. And so that we intentionally and not as CD dependent as we've been in the past. It depends on the company. But with our variety of funding sources, I don't think CD financing for you us in the future will be what it was in the past. Nancy Bush : Okay. If I could also ask, Daryl, if you could just -- I missed the summary of the energy portfolio or what may be dependent on energy. Could you just give us the numbers again, please, from a total perspective. Daryl Bible : Sure. I mean, we have $1.4 billion in outstanding and energy loans, and our allowance that we have allocated to energy is approximately 5%. Nancy Bush : Are those energy loans primarily Texas centric? I mean is this sort of one of the characteristics of going into Texas? Or are they distributed in other geographies as well? Clarke Starnes : Nancy, this is Clark. They're originated out of a specialty group out of Houston, but they're all over the country in all the different energy bases. Daryl Bible : But, Nancy, in case you missed that, it's a very conservative portfolio, 67% is upstream, 30% is midstream and only 3% is support services and we also have no delinquencies, no losses, and no non-accruals. Nancy Bush : And percentage investment grade if you have that. Daryl Bible : That's -- 75% of our portfolio of course, I recall, are either in upstream or investment grade portfolios. Clarke Starnes : That's right. So it's high majority is near investment grade or investment grade. Nancy Bush : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : And this concludes our Q&A session. I will turn the call back to our moderators for any additional or closing remarks. Kelly King : Okay. Thank you everyone for joining us. We have no further commentary at this time. This concludes our call. Thank you and I hope you have a good day. Operator : And this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you again for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Alan. Good morning everybody and thank you very much for taking time to join our call. Overall, we had a what I'd call a solid quarter with nice increase in net income and record net interest income. Net income was $527 million, up 8% versus first quarter and 20% annualized versus the fourth, so solid performance. Diluted EPS was $0.67 which was flat to the first quarter 2015 but was up an annualized 18.9% versus the first quarter. Capital ROA was 1.09%, GAAP ROTCE was 13.87%. Now, if you adjust for mergers charges only, adjusted ROA was 1.12% and adjusted return on tangible common was 14.2%, so solid returns there. In terms of revenues, we had strong revenues growth despite related to some challenges in mortgage banking income and service charges on deposits. So revenues totaled $2.6 billion which was up 10.2% versus the first quarter and 4.2% annualized versus the fourth. We did have record net interest income as I indicated at $1.6 billion, up 16.4% versus the first and 6.8% annualized versus the fourth. Really happy about the fact that net interest margin grew to 3.43%, up 8 basis points. and Daryl will give more color on that. Had a nice, a small but nice improvement in efficiency to 58.3% from 58.8%. Non-interest expenses were very well managed, decreased $52 million or 13.1% annualized and we did have positive operating leverage. Our average loans were down slightly versus fourth quarter. But keep in mind, we continued to adjust our mix on letting our lower spread mortgage balances and sales finance portfolios decline. We are improving our profitability in those areas, so that strategy is working, but it's just not producing loan volume increases. Keep in mind, we also have run-off in our Susquehanna Hann portfolio and we have a seasonal slower growth in a number of our specialized businesses. So average loans and leases for the quarter were $134.4 billion. And if you exclude our mortgage run-off and sales finance run-off, loans held for investment grew 2.2%, which is kind of the number that we look at. That was led by a good performance in income-producing properties, direct retail, other lending subsidiaries and our dealer floor plan. In terms of our strategic highlights, I would point out we did convert Susquehanna in November. We've seen reductions in FTEs, other cost savings. Overall, it is going very well. We did complete our acquisition of National Penn on April 1. We'll be converting that in most likely mid-July. That's going very well. Scott Fainor, the CEO of National Penn, is now our group president for our northern region. He's off to a fast start. I feel really good about his leadership and the teams that we have in that area. We did complete our acquisition of Swett & Crawford on April 1. This is an outstanding company, a 100-year old company with a great brand, has $200 million in revenue. Keep in mind, and this is a little complex, but last year, very importantly from a strategic point of view, we sold American Coastal because it was outside our risk appetite. And now we've effectively completed that process by replacing it with Swett & Crawford. So we got the revenue back and a virtually no risk basis. So that completes that transition, and we feel really good about it. The key now, of course, in the insurance business, in particular in Swett & Crawford, is to get cost saves and overall improvement in margins. And now, before I go through the rest of the points here, I just want to make a few important key strategic points. So with regard to M&A, as I said, things are going well. After we announced National Penn, we said we would take a pause. All of the deals that we have, we're really excited about. Texas for example, where we acquired those branches from Citigroup. Rick and I were down there a couple of weeks ago, in Dallas and Houston, and we could not be more pleased in terms of how we are being received and how well things are going. And frankly, the overall Texas market is still very, very vibrant notwithstanding the questions around energy. It's a really, really outstanding market of about 29 million people. It's growing 1,000 people a day. So it's a fantastic market. Really excited about what's going on in Northern Kentucky and Cincinnati. Susquehanna as I said is off to a good start. National Penn is just getting started, but it has enormous opportunities of synergies with Susquehanna and in the overall revenue opportunities in Pennsylvania. So we feel overall really good about our merger strategy, but now is the time for us to focus on the enormous opportunities that we have to improve performance in the areas of investment that we have made for last several years. So I want to be clear. Our focus is not on strategic deals but on improving our profitability through basically two areas, which is what you would expect, expense management and revenue enhancement. In the expense management area, we will be focusing on the cost synergies in the community bank. Primarily in the Pennsylvania area, we've done a lot in the rest of the community bank over the last few years, but there's still some opportunity, particularly in Pennsylvania. We have a really good opportunity to rationalize the huge investments we've made in the back room in terms of processes and procedures. We spent a fortune in the last several years building all that up. Now is the time to rationalize that. In terms of digital transformation, while we will be increasing our investment in digital transformation, lots of opportunity to overall become more efficient as you link the front room and the back room, and that's what our recent executive management changes is designed to do, so we think that'll be a combination revenue enhancement, expense reduction. And then of course, there's huge opportunities for insurance integration, particularly in Swett & Crawford. On the revenue side, we'll continue to get huge revenue enhancements from our community bank. The rate of momentum improvement there, particularly in our new markets is exponential, so we feel very excited about that. We will continue really, really strong performance in wealth corporate banking insurance and others. So, given our intense focus on realizing new benefits from our previous strategic investments, stock repurchases or buybacks move up in priority as we think about CCAR 2016 versus strategic initiatives. I'd be happy to answer questions later with regard to that, but we wanted to be sure you were clear about where we are strategically. If you'll turn to page 4, I'll just mention a couple of items that are unusual this quarter. We did have mergers that was about $23 million or $0.02 negative effect on EPS. We did take security gains of about $45 million, which is a part of our strategy in terms of matching all security gains and credit issues, so that was a $0.04 positive. And then the energy-related provision in excess of charge-offs was $28 million or $0.02. Now with regard to energy credits, the provision exceeded charge-offs by $30 million or $0.02 as I indicated. Daryl's going to give you a lot of detail on this, but I just wanted to point out that the charge that we took does reflect the new regulatory guidance and the recent SNC exam results. So, while it's fairly possible that we could have some more energy negative, we do not expect that. We think we built a significant allowance and we think we should expect our provision to be lower in the second quarter. So we feel, frankly, really good. It's a relatively small part of our whole portfolio, about 1.2%. But I know that's a big interest area and Clarke will be glad to give more detail on that later. But we feel really good about that. If you look at the loan area, we feel really good about loan growth relative to the economy. Just a couple of comments about the economy. It is what I would call good but not great. It's okay. It's rocking along about like it's been rocking along, 2% to 2.5%. It'll vary a little bit quarter-to-quarter. But we, the United States economy is on a sustained 2% to 2.5% kind of growth pattern. And it will stay that way in my humble opinion for a good while. We see no practical possibilities of recession, notwithstanding the fact there's been a lot of conversation about that. And the reason is because we think there is a very, very strong solid pent-up need for continuing investment. When I talk to business people, they're investing in a way that I call passive investment. That is to say, they're not excited enough about the future to go out and make major expansions and so forth. But they're driving trucks that have 250,000 miles on it. They got ten-year old equipment, and so stuff just wears out. And so, that's why you have to keep investing. So that creates kind of a floor on the economy in my view. There's an upside if we were to get better positive leadership out of DC and make some changes in taxes and regulation, et cetera. But assuming that's not going take the place or case, we think there's a solid 2% to 2.5%. I would point out that I saw some numbers recently that suggested that most of our markets in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast will be growing 1 point or 1.5 points faster than the national average. So being in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast is still a good place to be. So we are focusing on, as I said, profitability in our portfolio. We believe profitable loan growth is more important than absolute loan growth. So, just a little bit more detail with regard to the loan area. Our C&I loans were down slightly, mostly due to the decline in commercial loans in the branch network and mortgage warehouse. On the other hand, end-of-period loans were better with C&I up 2.5% annualized. Good news is C&I spreads are stable compared to last quarter. Growth is affected but our strategies of restricted growth in multifamily and REITs, so we continue to be pretty conservative. We're currently expecting C&I to grow at a faster pace in the second quarter, probably in the mid single digits. Daryl's going to give you a lot more color on energy as I pointed out, but I'll just emphasize again that we have built our reserves and we're very confident that our exposures are manageable. CRE growth was essentially flat with a decline in construction and our growth in income producing. So in income producing, net increase 7% annualized, feel really good about that, fastest growth coming from office and hospitality and some small decline in retail. The good news is market fundamentals generally continue to improve. All the spreads are still tight. We expect CRE construction and development to continue to decline somewhat in the second quarter, and IPP to grow at a similar pace as in the first quarter. Dealer floor plan had a very strong quarter, up $76 million or 26% annualized. That's being driven by expansion in our new markets and some new lines that we've introduced, so that's going very well. So floor plan is expected to continue to grow in the double digits for this year. Average direct retail lending is a bright spot for us, increasing $211 million or almost 8% annualized. A lot of that is HELOC and direct order from the branches. Rick and his team have really made a sea change in terms of our consumer production out of the branches. On the other hand, our wealth division continues to make a significant contribution in retail lending, really good production as they work closely together. So we expect the retail lending to continue to grow at a similar pace. Average sales finance, primarily large prime auto declined $484 million or 18%. That's a continuation of our execution of our flat rate compensation program. That is going well. It does produce less volumes, but it produces better margins. And so we feel really good about that. The lines will cross in terms of the old portfolio running off the new portfolio soon, so that will stabilize. We do have a contingent run-off of the Hann portfolio for a bit longer. And so overall we think once we get through the next quarter or so that portfolio will be kind of flattish. And then it will start to grow. Average residential mortgage loans were down $470 million or 16% linked quarter annualized. So keep in mind we continue to sell essentially all of our conforming production. And we think again that's in terms of overall, our quality management of the balance sheet. Originations in the quarter were $3.6 billion, about 2% more than the fourth. That was reflected in some seasonal improvement. And application volume I was glad to see increased 39% compared to the fourth, in total $6.9 billion. So we're definitely seeing a bit of resurgence in new home purchases. Young people are back buying homes again. And that's a really good thing. Our margins on gain of sale improved about 9%. Best level since the first quarter of 2015. So looking forward we believe this portfolio decline will slow and be about flat for the year. Our other lending subsidiaries continue to do well. They grew $158 million or 5%. But keep in mind that's a weak quarter for them. They'll be back stronger in the second. Did a really good performance in Grandbridge and equipment financing. So we would expect the seasonally stronger other lending segment to accelerate in the second quarter because of seasonality. So overall, the average loans are expected to be up 1% to 3% on a core basis next quarter. Obviously with the impact of National Penn, growth will be closer to 20%. And I will point out that is real growth. Those are real assets. But we like to distinguish between organic and core growth. So average loans in the second quarter are expected to be about $141 billion. If you look at slide 6, overall deposit program is going very well. Our deposit mix continued to improve. We continued to do a really good job managing our cost of interest-bearing deposits. We're up only 1 basis point, even though we had the rate increase at the end of the year. So average total deposits increased $1.4 billion or 3.7% annualized. And that's a really good growth rate given our intense focus on managing our cost. So let me turn it to Daryl now for \u2013 give a bit more color on some of the numbers. Daryl N. Bible - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Thank you, Kelly, and good morning everyone. Today, I'm going to talk about credit quality, net interest margins, fee income, non-interest expense, capital and our segment results. Turning to slide 7. Overall credit quality outside the energy portfolio remains stable. Net charge-offs totaled $154 million or 46 basis points. Excluding energy-related losses at $30 million, net charge-offs improved from the prior quarter to 37 basis points. Loans 90 days or more past due declined $26 million, mostly driven by loans acquired from the FDIC, impaired loans, and a decrease in residential mortgage. Loans 30 to 89 days past due decreased $205 million or 20%, mostly due to seasonality in Regional Acceptance, as well as decreases in residential mortgage, sales finance, C&I and CRE. NPAs increased 27% to 42 basis points, driven by $206 million in energy-related credits moved to non-accrual. If you exclude energy, NPAs totaled 33 basis points, a modest improvement compared to fourth quarter levels. We are about halfway through our spring redeterminations. We expect NPAs to remain in a similar range in the second quarter, assuming no unexpected impact from that process. We expect net charge-offs to be in the range of 35 basis points to 45 basis points. Continuing on slide 8. Our energy portfolio consists of 100 clients with $1.6 billion in outstandings, consisting of 65% upstream, 27% midstream, and 8% in support services. And the coal portfolio totals $215 million in outstandings. We take a very conservative approach to energy lending. We do not lend to offshore producers, mezzanine and second lien facilities, or take equity positions. During the quarter we fully implemented the regulatory guidance from the SNC exam. The allocated reserves totaled 8.5%. And 44% of the energy portfolio was criticized and classified. It's important to note today, all borrowers are paying consistent with their agreements. As a result we believe our energy portfolio is manageable. Turning to slide 9. Our allowance coverage ratios remain strong at 2.4 times for net charge-offs, and 1.89 times for NPLs. The allowance to loans ratio improved to 1.10%, compared to 1.07% last quarter. Excluding the acquired portfolios, the allowance to loan ratio is 1.17%, so our effective allowance coverage is higher. Remember, our acquired loans have a combined mark of about $636 million. We recorded a provision of $184 million for the quarter, compared to net charge-offs of $154 million. This includes $30 million in net charge-offs related to the energy portfolio and an additional provision of $30 million to build the allowance to 8.5%. Looking forward, our provision is expected to match net charge-offs plus loan growth. We believe that the provision will be much lower than this quarter's numbers, assuming no large deterioration in credit quality. Turning to slide 10. Compared to last quarter, net interest margin was 3.43%, up 8 basis points and core margin was 3.18%, up 6 basis points. The margin increase resulted from a seasonal interest income on assets related to post-employment benefits, duration adjustments in acquired securities and higher repricing of variable rate assets combined was stable deposit rates. Looking at the second quarter, assuming no Fed rate increases, we expect GAAP margin to decline a few basis points driven by the runoff of PCI loans and the loss of a positive seasonal impact of interest income on benefit plans, offset by National Penn. We expect core margin to remain relatively stable. Asset sensitivity remains relatively unchanged. We continue to forecast only one interest rate hike this year happening in November. Continuing on slide 11. Non-interest income totaled $1 million, relatively flat compared to last quarter. The fee income ratio was 40.6%. Looking at a few of those components, insurance income increased $39 million or 41% annualized, mostly due to seasonal factors, higher employee benefit and property casualty commissions offset by lower life insurance commissions. Remember, our first quarter of last year included earnings of American Coastal, a business we sold last May. Excluding acquisitions, insurance income grew 1.9% versus last year. Mortgage banking income totaled $91 million, down $13 million, mostly due to lower commercial mortgage production. Other income decreased $58 million due to a $43 million decrease in income related to assets of certain post-employment benefits and $14 million decline in client derivative income. Looking ahead to the second quarter, including both acquisitions, our total non-interest income is expected to increase 9% to 11% versus second quarter GAAP of $1.016 billion. Turning to slide 12. Non-interest expenses totaled $1.5 billion, down 13% versus last quarter. Personnel expense increased $22 million, driven by a $34 million increase in social security and unemployment taxes, as well as equity-based compensation for retirement-eligible associates, and a $10 million increase in higher pension expense, offset by $30 million decrease in post-employment benefits expense. Average FTEs declined 311. Merger-related and restructuring charges declined $27 million, mostly due to Susquehanna conversion costs. In addition, other expense decreased $34 million, mostly due to the lower operating charge-offs and charitable contributions. Our effective tax rate was 30%, and we expect second quarter effective tax rate to be about 31%. We expect expenses to total $1.75 billion next quarter. This will include the initial expense base for National Penn and Swett & Crawford, plus $40 million to $50 million in merger-related costs. We expect cost savings to accelerate after the third quarter systems conversion of National Penn and the first quarter 2017 conversion of Swett & Crawford. But in the second quarter, we may have a slight uptick in the efficiency ratio due to the timing of our acquisitions and the delayed timing of related cost savings and synergies. We remain confident we will achieve cost savings related to both acquisitions. We expect efficiency to improve later in the year. Turning to slide 13. Capital ratios remain very healthy and fully phased in. common equity Tier 1 at 10.2%. Our LCR increased to 135% and our liquid asset buffer at the end of the quarter was very strong at 14.5%. We successfully issued $465 million in preferred stock at 5.625% which strengthens our regulatory capital in a cost effective way. Our tangible book increased 2.7% this quarter. Finally, a comment on CCAR 2016. As Kelly mentioned, we expect to place greater priority on stock repurchases versus strategic initiatives. Now let's look at some segment results, beginning on slide 14. Community Bank's net income totaled $310 million, an increase of $38 million from last quarter and up $101 million from the first quarter of last year. Net interest income increased $64 million from the fourth quarter, with about two-thirds of the increase driven by Susquehanna. Turning to slide 15. Residential Mortgage net income totaled $39 million, down $10 million from last quarter, driven by seasonally lower production and lower servicing fee income. Production mix was 55% purchase and 45% refi. Looking to slide 16, Dealer Financial Services income totaled $42 million, essentially flat as declines in segment net interest income were substantially offset by lower loan processing expense. Regional Acceptance continues to generate stable loan growth with prudent underwriting discipline. This portfolio totals $3.3 billion, and losses have normalized to the 8% range. Net charge-offs for the prime portfolio remained excellent at 16 basis points. Turning to slide 17, Specialized Lending net income totaled $56 million, down $7 million from last quarter, driven by lower commercial mortgage and leasing income and higher provision. Turning to slide 18. Insurance services net income totaled $53 million, up $17 million from last quarter, mostly driven by a seasonal increase in employee benefits and higher property and casualty commissions, partially offset by seasonally lower life insurance commissions. We expect Swett & Crawford to add revenues of approximately $160 million for the remainder of this year, coupled with $140 million in expenses. In 2017, we will realize synergies from the deal that will drive improved operating margins going forward. Turning to slide 19, the Financial Services segment had $26 million in net income, down $77 million from last quarter, largely driven by a provision increase of $92 million related to the energy portfolio. Corporate banking generated 15% loan growth and wealth had 6% loan growth along with 29% transaction deposit growth. In summary for the quarter, we achieved improved efficiency, net interest margin expansion, positive operating leverage and we feel that we are set up to have a very strong second half of 2016. Now, let me turn it back over to Kelly for closing remarks and Q&A. Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Daryl. So overall, we feel like our M&A strategy is executing very, very well. Loan growth is good, particularly in the environment. Credit quality is very good ex-energy and energy relative to the marketplace is extremely good. And so, we feel like now we have just this really wonderful opportunity to focus on realizing the advantages that we've invested in for a number of years now. So we feel really great about our opportunity to improve efficiencies and our operating profit as we go forward, so we continue to believe our best days are ahead. So now, we will turn it over to Alan. Alan Greer - Executive Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Kelly. At this time, we'll begin our Q&A session. Ebony, if you could please come back on the line and explain how our listeners can participate and ask questions. Operator : Absolutely. Thank you. And we will take our first question from Matt O'Connor. Please go ahead. Alan Greer - Executive Vice President- Investor Relations : Matt? Matt, we can't hear you. You're on mute. Operator : One moment. And Matt, your line is open. Please go ahead. Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Can you, guys hear me? Alan Greer - Executive Vice President- Investor Relations : We can hear you. Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Matt. Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: All right. Great. Okay. Just starting on the cost saves, could you just remind us how much is still to come from all the deals that have closed, and then will these fall to the bottom line or are there some offsets as we think about, call it core BB&T or legacy BB&T? Daryl N. Bible - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : So Matt, if you go back a year-plus ago, the Citi branches and Bank of Kentucky, all those have basically come in, both the cost saves and revenues and all that. From Susquehanna's perspectives, we are probably 85% to 90% through the cost saves from that. So the rest of the cost saves will probably bleed in into our run rate over the next couple quarters or out of the community bank area. But that's where we stand there. As far as the two deals that we just closed April 1, there's really no cost saves in those transactions. We expect National Penn had systems conversion third quarter, so you might see a little bit third quarter but more of that in fourth quarter and first quarter. And Swett & Crawford, maybe a little bit on revenue synergies this year but their systems conversion is the first part of 2017, and their cost saves and efficiencies will come in in probably in the first half of 2017. Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the revenue side, I mean bigger picture, like how should we think about what areas you're trying to cross sell into, just the broader Mid-Atlantic franchise? Obviously there is the scale benefit, but what other product sets do you think can get ramped up in that franchise, and when do we start seeing some of those benefits in a more meaningful manner? Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, Matt, we think the number, it's kind of pervasive, but the standout ones are continuing to expand the benefits from our corporate banking relationships. Recall that over the last several years, we've been starting those relationships on the credit side, and then the follow on residual benefits in terms of deposits and other fee services come. So that will be a big one. Our wealth management continues to integrate very, very well in terms of loan balances and other fee balances that are coming in. Our retail banking, retail lending is coming on very, very strong, and then the huge benefit from the insurance area as we integrate Swett & Crawford and continue to integrate Crump, and continue to use the Crump cross-sell abilities throughout the entire community bank in terms of selling life insurance. All of those are some of the ones that are really big standouts. Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : And we'll now take our next question from Michael Rose with Raymond James. Michael Rose - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. Kelly, I just wanted to touch on the efficiency ratio. You may not hit your target this year, but that's okay. You obviously announced another insurance acquisition. Can you just give us your thoughts in light of the environment in terms of what we could expect for the insurance \u2013 or for the efficiency ratio, both maybe in the nearer term and then longer term, if there's any changes? Thanks. Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I think we will end up this year with improvement. It may be in the 57%-ish kind of range. Feel pretty confident about that. We still think over the next two years or three years, we'll get to the mid-50s%. And I know some people talk about the low 50s%. That is not going to happen unless you get a substantial ramp-up in the yield curve. Remember this is a numerator/denominator problem. So we're assuming that the economy will grow at 2% to 2.5%. There'll be a slow ramp-up in the yield curve, but not dramatic. Therefore, it makes it harder to grind out efficiency improvements. Still though, with opportunities that we have to generate additional revenues out of our investments we've made, and the ability to generate additional efficiencies from the investments we've made, we think we'll be able to hit those targets. Michael Rose - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up. How should we think about the dividend payout ratio going forward? You guys are trending a little higher than you have historically. You mentioned in the prepared remarks about CCAR being more focused on buybacks this year. But should we actually expect a dividend increase this year? Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So our strategies in terms of capital deployment remain the same. But we've always said they adjust from time to time. The ones that don't change is you always use capital investment to get the nice organic growth you can get. Number two has been and will remain dividends. The swing is between buybacks and M&A. So what I was leading to earlier is that there's a slip there for the \u2013 going forward for a while in terms of buybacks being more important than M&A, as we focus on realizing these opportunities. Now with regard to dividends, we can certainly hope. I mean our CCAR application is in. And as you know we never can say for sure what's going to happen. But we would certainly expect to have a dividend increase, because even though our dividend payout's somewhat high, it's not high by traditional standards. And it's not the high relative to the stable revenues streams that we have. So we're very comfortable with a dividend increase this year. Michael Rose - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then maybe just one final one for me. Just on your \u2013 and I know it's small. But just in your coal portfolio, it seems like the criticized number of 15% seems a little low from what I would expect. Any sort of trends there that give you confidence that that portfolio will \u2013 the loss content won't be a lot worse than maybe my expectations? Thanks. Clarke R. Starnes III - Chief Risk Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Yes, Michael. This is Clarke Starnes. Fair question. I would tell you that we have been methodically reducing our exposure in the coal space for a long time. And we believe a number of the residual borrowers we have are bankable, although we would continue to expect exposure to go down from here. We also took \u2013 as part of that $30 million this quarter, we opportunistically exited one of our larger long-time legacy watch list coal credits and got it out completely. So we feel like what's left we can manage through. Although the watch list could go up, we feel like the exposure is manageable. Michael Rose - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks for the color. Appreciate it. Operator : And we'll move next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Alan Greer - Executive Vice President- Investor Relations : Hey, Betsy. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So a question, just one follow-up to the question on energy, is you did indicate \u2013 and I appreciate the color around the percentage of the portfolio that's criticized and classified. That's against a denominator that is both funded and unfunded? Or is that just a denominator that is funded? Alan Greer - Executive Vice President- Investor Relations : Betsy, that's based on funded balances. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Right. Okay. Got it. That's great. And then separately as you're thinking about how the industry progresses from here, can you give us a sense as to how you work with your clients? And how you're making the decisions to either continue to reinvest with them or to potentially help them shrink or sell or exit or reduce your exposure with them? Or is it too late for that, and what you have is what you have? Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Betsy, are you talking about primarily the energy area? Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Correct. Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So we made a decision, Betsy, some time ago to be a long-term player in the energy market. We are not going to change that long-term strategy. Energy is an important business for the country, for the world and for us. We enter into relationships on a very conservative selection basis and a conservative underwriting basis. Obviously everybody is really energized about \u2013 no pun intended \u2013 about concerns about energy now. But \u2013 and we're taking it very seriously. And we're marking our book really aggressively and all that. But look, I think there's a much higher chance that oil will be at $50 by the end of this year than $30. And I think over the long term, the energy business still will be a really good business. And so we will stick with it. And we will stick with our really good clients. And we'll continue to be supportive to the industry. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And so \u2013 and do I have it correct that if oil were to be at $30 for a while that you've already done all the reserving that you need to do? Or the vast majority of the reserving? Never say 100%. But the vast majority of the reserving you need to do, in which case we should expect the provision could come down a bit next quarter? Clarke R. Starnes III - Chief Risk Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Absolutely, Betsy. We believe the provision expense, unless we get something totally unforeseen, would be much lower than last quarter. To remind you we kind of said our NCO guidance is 35 basis points to 45 basis points. We would assume that we will be in low to mid range of that if we don't have an energy surprise. If we have more energy deterioration it might be mid to high. So as Daryl said, we're expecting to fund charge-offs and keep our reserve rate for growth. And we would not expect a larger build for the second quarter. So in our 8.5%, we've assumed I think prudently and conservatively draw assumptions, and we've fully implemented the guidance. So we would not anticipate from here a significant increase in the provision. I would mention, too, we've been through about 60% of our spring redeterminations already. Our average loan reductions were about 20% and about two-thirds of those redeterminations, we've got structural enhancement with any hoarding provisions or more collateral. So to your, Kelly's point, we're working with these borrowers and what we certainly have that we've reserved for what we know today. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : And we'll move next to Lana Chan with BMO Capital Markets. Lana Laiyan Chan - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Good morning. Two follow-up questions. One, on the CCAR ask for 2016 and prioritizing buybacks and dividends, is that just for the second half of this year or does that go extend into 2017? Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. That would be for entire CCAR period, which would extend into 2017. Lana Laiyan Chan - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Thank you. And Daryl, if you could help me run through how we get from the first quarter expense level to the $1.75 billion in the second quarter. It just seems a little bit higher than what I would have modeled in with the adds-on. I know you gave the Swett inclusion. What else is going up in terms of the step up and what's coming from Nat Penn? Daryl N. Bible - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Yeah. I mean, if you look at National Penn and Swett & Crawford, those two add in approximately $100 million to $110 million in expenses into the second quarter off their base. And if you add in maybe an additional $30 million more in expense saves, then that leaves about $60 million left approximately. And I would say second quarter, usually we have higher revenues, so you pay out higher commissions. That's a percentage there. And then probably then the next biggest increase that we have across the board is probably just in technology and IT. We continue to invest in those areas and those areas continue to increase some. But I feel that we are very focused on our expenses. I think we have a chance of maybe exceeding what we're saying, beating it. But right now we're just putting out conservative numbers from an expense base. But as Kelly said, we will focus on improving efficiency throughout the year. With all these acquisitions closing first of this quarter, it's going to be really messy trying to put it all together. Lana Laiyan Chan - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And then that starts really stepping down starting in the fourth quarter? Daryl N. Bible - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Yes. Correct. Lana Laiyan Chan - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you, Daryl. Operator : We'll move next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning, Kelly. Good morning, Daryl. Daryl N. Bible - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Hey, Gerard. Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Morning. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : This question maybe is more for Clarke. Clearly, BB&T has done a very good job in improving its credit quality post the financial crisis. And BB&T, along with many of the other banks, all have built up the reserves this quarter for the energy, SNC exam that took place very recently. And so the question is, what did the regulators do that was so different that none of the banks had anticipated back in the fourth quarter? I know energy prices fell to below $30 in February, but were they doing stuff that just was unusual and we have not seen before which forced everybody to build up these reserves? Clarke R. Starnes III - Chief Risk Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : I think, Gerard, what I think the fundamental \u2013 my opinion \u2013 the fundamental change in the guidance. Historically as you know, reserve based lending, asset classifications, accrual status, impairment view was based more from a senior secured collateral asset base coverage standpoint against that primary bank debt. What's happened with this boom in the shale production with this cycle is you have a lot more secondary bond financing behind the bank grew. And the new regulatory guidance is very explicit around you have to make sure that you have sufficient cash flow coverage and asset coverage for the total debt including the secondary debt. And obviously, with the plunge in prices that nobody could have predicted, it puts enormous pressure on those ratios. So that's really the big sea change. We still believe, given all that, with enough time and with recovery in the prices that we have a good shot at getting, having better recoveries. But we have to prudently reserve in the meantime. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. And then speaking of Shared National Credit exams, obviously we have the national one going on right now for all loan categories. Clarke, are you hearing of any sea changes there? Excluding the energy since you guys all just did that, but is there any talk of looking at different categories of loans quite a bit differently? Clarke R. Starnes III - Chief Risk Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : We are not hearing anything yet, any sort of chatter like that like we had heard with the first exam around energy. So at this point, we are not. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And then, Kelly, in looking at your slide 11 in the presentation where you focus on the fee income ratio, it's dropped down quite a bit. And one of the hallmarks of your company has always been a 45% or so fee revenue to total revenue. Is this a new change that we're going to be seeing it now closer to 40% or is this a temporary change? Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No, Gerard, I think this is more temporary. I think that we've had a range of 41%, 42%, to 40% has been kind of high, frankly. But we think in terms of 42%, 43% as kind of normal. We don't want to get too far out of balance one way or the other. So and it depends on, again, the interest rate environment. So if your interest rates go down, then your non-interest income goes up as a percentage. But on a normalized basis I'm fairly comfortable with our non-interest income, meaning we're in the 40%, 42%, 43% kind of level. Right now so you got \u2013 recently you had the net interest income being down, which would drive the ratio up. On the other hand, insurance is not at the level that it would be relatively, because of the pace of business. And so that would affect it. And the temporary impact has been the removal of American Coastal last year, which of course will come right back now when we added Swett & Crawford. So it's not a change, Gerard, from a long-term point of view at all. It'll be right back where we wanted to be, 42%, 43%. And then probably, hopefully, hang at that level, because hopefully the net interest income comes back up. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Appreciate the color. Thank you. Operator : And we'll move next to Paul Miller with FBR & Company. Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Hey, thank you very much. Hey, can you \u2013 Kelly, can you talk a little bit more \u2013 the comments, you mentioned that you're going to focus less on M&A going forward. Does that mean both in the insurance side and the banking side? And you're going to focus more on capital management through buybacks? Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Paul. That's exactly right. I'm not trying to say that we wouldn't dare do any tiny little bitty something. But as a practical matter, we are just not focusing on M&A now in insurance or bank, which is our two primary areas. The truth is we just got a lot going on in both of them. We've just (47:31). And there's a time to buy, and there's time to run. And the last 24 months was a time to buy, because the times were right. There was a window for us, and there was some really good opportunities. And we're really happy about what we did. And now is the time to take time and to adjust what we've done and run it really, really well and get the benefit for the benefit of our shareholder. I mean this is a shareholder-driven strategy, gearing our profitability up and reaping some of the benefits of the previous investments we've made. And that applies to insurance and banking and basically everything else. Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: So should we be modeling a higher buyback level? Or should we wait to \u2013 the Fed comes out with their tests where \u2013 what's got approved? Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I mean all of us have to wait to see what the Fed approves. But I mean as a practical manner, if I were you modeling, I'd be modeling for higher buybacks. Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Thank you very much, guys. Operator : And we'll move next to Stephen Scouten with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Stephen Kendall Scouten - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Hey, guys. Thanks. I had a question for you on the forward loan growth expectations. I see you put 1% to 3% kind of guidance for 2Q. Is that an expectation of slower kind of resi runoff and sales finance runoff? Or is that just higher overall originations? What's going to drive that delta quarter over quarter? Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, it's lower. The resi runoff is cleaning out if you will, and then you get the seasonal activity buildup in the second. Stephen Kendall Scouten - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay, makes sense. And is that kind of what you expect for the full year as well, in that 1% to 3% range? Daryl N. Bible - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : So it's going to be \u2013 from an organic basis I would say we'd have a little bit more loan growth from second to third, how we sit now. I mean visibility out a couple quarters is not perfect. But if we're 1% to 3%, you might add another 1% or 2% to that for second to third. But we'll see how the economy plays out. Stephen Kendall Scouten - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay. Great. And then one follow-up just on the kind of uses of capital, buyback versus M&A. I mean is that something that you would consider to be a hard and fast kind of decision at this point through the next CCAR request? Or will you still have flexibility like you had kind of this year to either do repurchases or M&A, depending upon opportunities? Or is your request even submitted as simply buybacks, and we won't see them change it back? Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No, no. Our request has the same flexibility in it that we've always had. But the guidance I'm giving you with regard to our focus on profitability management versus M&A is very hard. Stephen Kendall Scouten - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Got you. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. Operator : And we'll move next to John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari - Evercore ISI : Good morning, guys. Alan Greer - Executive Vice President- Investor Relations : Morning, John. John Pancari - Evercore ISI : On the buyback topic could you help us in how to size it up? And if it is something that's much more of a \u2013 that we could have much greater confidence in now, Kelly, how should we think about the magnitude of it? I mean you're at a 40% payout right now on the dividend. You indicated that could go up a little bit. Where could we go on the buyback? And could we be approaching somewhere in the 80s% or 90s% in terms of a combined payout when you factor in the buyback activity? Thanks. Daryl N. Bible - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Yeah, John, this is Daryl. What I would say from a CCAR perspective, obviously nothing is approved yet. But last several years we've focused and we've traditionally been one of the higher ones on the payout ratio on dividend. We hope that that would continue with CCAR 2016. Now as far as the total payout ratio goes, I would say we like where our capital ratios are today. So as Kelly said, we're going to probably use 25% plus up in capital for organic growth. So the remaining percentage would probably be in buyback. John Pancari - Evercore ISI : Okay. All right. And then separately, Kelly, I just want to get a little bit more color around the change in tone on that front in terms of looking at more of the buyback opportunity with capital deployment versus M&A. Was there anything else that prompted that change in terms of either a regulatory environment and/or anything in terms of your \u2013 the trend in your efficiency that you're trying to get on top of something here? Thanks. Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : John, it's really a matter of looking at the number of deals. Ideally to be honest we wouldn't have done as many deals in as short a period of time as we did. It's just they were available. And you can't \u2013 I wish you could, but you can't ideally lay out your M&A plans on a linear basis and project them whenever you want to have them. They come when they come. And you take advantage of them when they're there. So we took a bit more in the last year and a half at one time than I personally would like to have. And so \u2013 and you combine that with all of the other activities we have going on, like these huge investments in the back room in terms of systems and processes and so forth. And it's just my very strong intuitive judgment, our collective team's judgment that it's just time to focus on taking advantage of what we have. See, sometimes people think about M&A and all this as a kind of linear upward sloping line. It's not. It's more like a stair step. You ramp up in terms of acquisitions, then you take a period of time and you rationalize them and then you ramp up again. So we're in that flatter part of the stair step where we're going to be focusing on rationalizing what we've already invested in. We think that's shareholder-friendly because if you just continually roll up all the time, you're never getting a real payback till you stop doing M&A for a little while and that's not fair to the shareholders. So this is more about taking advantage of what we did in the last year and a half. When we get that done, we'll be interested in M&A again. But for right now, we're focused on getting the advantages of what we already done. John Pancari - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thank you. Then one last thing if I could, on the margin. I know you indicated you got one rate hike modeled in the back part of the year. If that doesn't materialize, is it fair to assume that the margin sees some erosion here if there's no Fed hike this year? Daryl N. Bible - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : What I would say is right now we would be forecasting margin to probably be in the low 340s, probably for throughout 2016. Our rate hike that we have in November helps us but it's not a huge impact in the fourth quarter. So, and we're pretty much not assuming on any real rate rise help that (54:31). So we feel really good about the mix, the mixes going in our favor, loan mix, funding mix, and our spreads are coming in nicely. So our core margin has stabilized. So I feel GAAP margin in the 340s, low 340s is about right. John Pancari - Evercore ISI : Got it. Thanks, Daryl. Operator : And we'll move next to Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Kevin J. Barker - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Thank you for taking my questions. Regarding net interest income and your expectations going forward, you're modeling a rate hike. Bow are you looking at the long end of the yield curve at the same time? Daryl N. Bible - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Good question, Kevin. So the rate hike is in November so it really doesn't have a huge impact on net interest income. You look at the yield curve, we would keep our yield curve relatively constant where it is today. We don't really think it's going to steepen up much in our forecast that we have. If you look at our balance sheet, our balance sheet is pretty balanced. About half of our assets are floating rate, half are fixed. So when the curve actually came down some in the early part of 2016, the fixed portion got hurt a little bit from a net interest income perspective because those get priced off the yield curve. But, and we did a great job with our funding costs, keeping that very stable. All that's very sticky. We're having huge growth in funding and wider margins in our deposit franchise right now. Kevin J. Barker - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Okay. And then you mentioned that Regional Acceptance had a net charge-off rate of 7.9% and the prime bulk is roughly 19 basis points, which is very good. How does that compare to the year-over-year numbers and then quarter-over-quarter? Clarke R. Starnes III - Chief Risk Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Yeah, Kevin, this is Clarke. Regional Acceptance's losses are up year-over-year, so they're probably up 50 to 75 basis points or so. Our prime portfolio today is about 16 basis points, not 19, and is relatively stable quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year. So while it's very manageable, Regional Acceptance had experienced some higher loss severities. They primarily finance economy cars. If you look at Manheim over the last year or 18 months, that class of vehicles has been hit a little harder. We've adjusted for that over the last year. So and we're actually forecasting, notwithstanding the view of car prices over the next remainder of the year, we expect losses to be down more in the 7% range or so by the end of the year in regional. Kevin J. Barker - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): What would cause that decline in charge-offs given we're continuing to see pressure in used car prices? Sorry, guys. Clarke R. Starnes III - Chief Risk Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : No, absolutely. It's the adjustments we made 12 to 18 months ago on our advance rates. And as those burn through, we believe will be in a much better severity position even with the decline in prices. We've been lending into lower advance rates that we feel like we'll work through some of the older credits and we'll be in a better position. Kevin J. Barker - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Thank you for taking my question. Operator : And we'll move next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Amanda Larsen - Jefferies LLC : Hi. This is Amanda on for Ken. Daryl, given your strong first quarter NII results and the NIM dynamics you discussed, the guide range that you guys gave at the end of last year for plus I think 12% to 14% year-over-year for NII growth. Is the high side of the range in play now? Daryl N. Bible - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : On a year-over-year basis, Amanda, I think I grew very comfortable that we'll have 12%-plus growth on NII on a year-over-year basis from 2016 to 2015. Amanda Larsen - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thanks. And then are you expected to have some NPBC PAA in the second half? Daryl N. Bible - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Could you translate that for me a little bit, Amanda? Amanda Larsen - Jefferies LLC : I guess do you expect to have some purchase accounting accretion from NPBC? Daryl N. Bible - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Okay, yeah. So purchase accounting, what I could tell you is, is that the Susquehanna purchase accounting is starting to come off a little bit, but we have National Penn that we have a first time for go on for this quarter. So purchase accounting is going to be pretty robust for most of this year and will trend down over time. But 2016, I feel very comfortable that GAAP margin will be in the low 340s, second, third, fourth quarters and core margin we feel has stabilized, starting to improve some. So that could actually get into the low 320s. Amanda Larsen - Jefferies LLC : All right. Thank you. Daryl N. Bible - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Yeah. Operator : And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Greer, at this time, I will turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks. Alan Greer - Executive Vice President- Investor Relations : Okay. Thank you, Ebony, and thanks to all of our listeners for joining. This concludes our call for the day. If you have further questions, please don't hesitate to call Investor Relations and we hope that you have a good day. Operator : And this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.

King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Alan. Good morning everybody, and thanks to your interest in BB&T. We always appreciate you joining our call. So we had a very strong quarter from an organic performance perspective, and a strategic perspective. Net income totaled $541 million, up 19.2% versus the second quarter of 2015, and 10.7% versus first quarter of 2016. If you look at diluted EPS, it totaled $0.66, up from $0.62 on a like quarter, but down $0.01 from the first quarter, but that was due to higher merger-related and restructuring charges in this quarter, as you would expect. Adjusted diluted EPS totaled $0.71 excluding merger-related and restructuring charges, and the benefits from the special tax-advantaged assets, which I'll cover in a minute. Our GAAP ROA was a strong 1.06%, and return on tangible common was 14.33%. And if you make the adjustments, we alluded to, our ROA adjusted would be 1.16% and adjusted return on tangible would be 15.76%, which is very good. Record FTE revenues totaled $2.8 billion, up 17.7% versus second quarter 2015, 31% versus first quarter, obviously that was driven by our two acquisitions in this quarter. We had record net interest income of $1.7 billion, which was up 22.9% versus the second quarter, 22.8% versus the first quarter of 2016. Margin did decline two basis points in line with what we projected, and Daryl will give you a little color on that in a little bit. Efficiency was 59.3% compared to 59.2% in the second quarter of 2015, and 58.3% in the first quarter of 2016. It was up a bit as we had guided you on that because due to timing of the acquisitions and related conversions and the cost savings would impact. Non-interest expense has increased $250 million versus the first quarter 2016, but that was led by the impact of National Penn, Swett & Crawford and the merger-related and restructuring charges. If you ex out these items, we hit the number that we had projected. And again, Daryl will give you more color on that when we go forward. Average loans and leases, held for investment totaled $141 billion in the second quarter. It was an increase of 20.2% versus the first quarter. If you exclude the impact of National Penn, growth was still a solid 2.6%. We do continue to have runoff in our residential mortgage portfolio by design and our prime auto portfolio because of our design, structural change, due to very strategic decision related due to costs and the spreads in each one of these segments. If you exclude residential mortgage loans and National Penn, average loans held for investment grew a very respectable 4.7%, which frankly on an economy growing 2% to 2.5% is about right what we would expect to have happened. Loan quality is great. Net charge-offs were 0.28%, lowest levels since 2006. We did not get an objection to our FRB CCAR plan. So as you've seen, we've proposed a 7.1% increase in quarterly dividend, $640 million in share repurchases. So if you recall over the years, we've said very clearly that our priorities with regard to capital disposition is number one organic growth, number two dividends, number three M&A, and number four buybacks. So we've also said when things change, then the priorities change. So, today, organic growth is somewhat slower. We are increasing our dividend at a very nice rate. M&A is off the table, and then also buyback rise up to the higher level of importance, and that's exactly what we had said, and exactly what we plan to do. We did complete the conversion of National Penn this last week. And it's going absolutely, absolutely great. We cannot be more pleased about that. We are very, very excited about all of our acquisitions over the last 18 months. And we really, really focus on the execution on the profit improvement that will come from them. But we continue to not be interested in M&A for a while as we said. We got plenty to do, and frankly, we owe it to our shareholders, to execute on what we already done, and that's what we are doing. If you're following on the slides, look at the slide four in your deck, this is what I was relating to before. So our merger-related restructuring charges were higher than we had expected. It is $92 million pre-tax and $58 million after tax, which was $0.07 on the diluted EPS basis. That $92 million was made up of $63 million on merger charges from Nat Penn and Susquehanna, and Swett & Crawford, $29 million was in restructuring charges, which is including severance, branch and facility restructuring, and other real estate write downs. All of these will improve our run rate going forward. And so, while that $92 million is higher, the truth is we just simply found more opportunities than we had expected to accelerate our write-downs, and therefore, make it easy to do asset dispositions, and also reduce FTEs where we have to pay some severance that helps us going forward. So it's a good news story, a little higher, but it was higher for very, very good reason. I do want to reinforce that we are intensely focused on expenses. We've been focusing for a number of years, as you heard me describe about reconceptualization of our business, that continues, but I would say to you, it continues at a much more intense rate. The economy is relatively slow. We project a relatively low flat yield curve for a period of time. And as a result, we are accelerating our focus on expense reductions. We still do it from a kind of top down, bottom up perspective, focusing on allowing our people to have figure out the best ways to restructure their businesses versus us trying to sit in our offices and make the decision. We think that's just about a way. Our people are excited about the endeavor, and I think that \u2013 I think we'll get really, really good results from that. Following along on slide five, just a couple of comments only in loan area. It was a really good quarter with regard to loans. Our average loans, again, excluding Nat Penn increased 2.6%, primarily due to strong growth in C&I and CRE-IPP. C&I on a linked quarter basis was 9.4%, which is very, very strong, and CRE-IPP was 4.3%. So we feel very, very good about that. So if you exclude the residential mortgage rundown, which was by strategic design and Nat Penn, we had an annualized growth rate of 4.7% which I frankly feel very, very good about. We did have our typical very strong seasonal performance in a number of our consumer related businesses, like Sheffield which was up 33%, dealer floor plan was up 21%, Premium Finance up 12%, and Regional Acceptance up 11.2%. So those, remember, are our very good diversifying businesses, and they are performing very, very well, very, very good quality and very, very good profitability. So looking forward, we expect about the same kind of loan growth in the third quarter as we had in the second quarter, about 1% to 3%, unless there is some dramatic change in the economy, but that's what we would expect. Speaking of the economy, we think the economy is okay, still growing at about 2% to 2.5%. It's been an interesting six months as we came out of the first of the year when everybody thought the world was coming to an end with changes in China and so forth, and then it settled down, more recently everybody has gotten very, very excited about Brexit. We think the Brexit change is serious, but it's been over exaggerated in terms of its impact on the world and certainly on us. Our exports to the entire European Union is relatively small, and it just not will have a material impact on us, and probably not will have a material impact on the world, once it starts to settles. And also, as the political uncertainly wanes, we think businesses will have more confidence. Lack of confidence has been withholding back investment for several years. The way things seem to be developing on the political front, it looks like \u2013 I think the business community will feel pretty good, and certainly they will feel more confident going forward. And they do need to invest, but there has not a lot of active investments for the last several years, and I think, you're likely to see that as we head into 2017. Nonetheless, we are planning on a continuation of the same, slow economy 2% to 2.5%, low rates. If we get higher rates, then more confidence, more investments, that's just good, but that's not what we're planning on in terms of running our businesses. If you look quickly at slide six. We continue to improve our mix and lower our overall deposit costs. Our total deposits stand at $160 billion. That was an increase of $10 billion, obviously merger-related. If you exclude acquisitions, total deposits increased $3.9 billion, still a very strong 10.5%. And what I'm particularly pleased about is our mix improvement where our non-interest bearing deposits ex acquisitions increased $1.4 billion, or 12.1%, which is really, really strong, and we reduced our total cost of funds on deposits by another 2 basis points, which is really, really good down to 0.23%. So our deposit machine is working great, our loan machine is working solid, and as Daryl will report to you, our overall fee income businesses and our expense management is really hitting on all cylinders. So let me turn now to Daryl for some more commentary. Daryl N. Bible - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to talk about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, non-interest expense, capital and our segment results. Turning to slide seven. Overall, we had a really strong quarter with regard to credit quality. Net charge-offs totaled $97 million, or 28 basis points, a decrease from 46 basis points last quarter. This is our lowest charge-off rate since 2006. We restated loans for 90 days or more past due because of our Ginnie Mae buyback program. Given this change, loans 90 days past due were essentially flat from last quarter. Loans 30 days to 89 days past due increased $89 million or 10.8%, mostly due to seasonality in our consumer-related portfolios. NPAs decreased 1.9% to 40 basis points, with the majority of the loan portfolio showing improvement. If you look at the graph, excluding energy, NPAs have improved steadily in recent quarters. In the third quarter, we expect NPAs to remain in a similar range, and net charge-offs to be in the range of 35 basis points to 45 basis points, assuming no unexpected deterioration in the economy. Continuing on slide eight. We had a stable and quiet quarter in our oil and gas portfolio with lower non-accruals and substantially lower charge-offs compared with last quarter. The balances decreased 6%, and we will continue to have a good mix with less than 10% in oilfield services. Our reserve coverage for oil and gas has risen to 9.3%, and the coverage for coal, a very modest portfolio, has risen to 9.7%. Following the spring redeterminations, we reduced our average commitments. Turning to slide nine. Our allowance coverage ratios remain strong at 3.88 times for net charge-offs and 1.9 times for NPLs. The allowance-to-loan ratio was 1.06% compared to 1.11% last quarter. Excluding the acquired portfolio, the allowance-to-loan ratio is 1.16%. So our effective allowance coverage is strong. Remember, our acquired loans have a combined mark of about $750 million. We recorded a provision of $111 million compared to net charge-offs of $97 million. Looking forward, our provision is expected to match charge-offs plus loan growth. Turning to slide 10. Compared to last quarter, net interest margin was 3.41% down 2 basis points. Core margin was 3.16%, also down 2 basis points. Net interest margin decrease resulted from lower interest rate environment and higher security balances as a result of National Penn. Looking into the third quarter, we expect GAAP margin to decline a few basis points, driven by lower rates, including a flatter yield curve and a reduction in benefits from purchase accounting. We expect core margin to remain relatively stable, as lower rates will be offset by asset mix and funding cost and mix changes. We do not anticipate average earning assets to remain relatively stable next quarter. Asset sensitivity increased primarily due to changes in free funds as well as investment in deposit mix changes. Continuing on slide 11. Non-interest income totaled $1.1 billion, up $114 million compared to last quarter. The fee income ratio improved to 42.8%. Looking at a few of the changes in non-interest income. Insurance income increased $46 million, driven by several factors. First, the acquisition of Swett & Crawford, which added $57 million in the second quarter. We also had $34 million seasonal increase in property, casualty commissions, and a $13 million increase in other insurance revenues. This was offset by a seasonal decline in employee benefit commissions of $36 million and a decrease of $23 million, which is mostly due to lower bonus commissions. Excluding acquisitions, insurance income grew about 1% versus the same quarter last year. Mortgage banking income totaled $111 million, up $20 million, mostly due to higher gains on sale and increase in saleable residential loan volume, and seasonally higher commercial mortgage income. The other income increased $65 million due to $65 million increase in income related to certain post-employment benefits. Looking ahead to the third quarter, total fee income is expected to be relatively flat due to a seasonal decrease in insurance revenues. Turning to slide 12. Non-interest expenses totaled $1.8 billion, up $252 million versus last quarter. Personnel expense increased $124 million, driven by several factors. First, we had a $44 million increase in salary expense, mostly due to the addition of approximately 1,900 FTEs from recent acquisitions. We also had a $40 million increase in post-employment benefit expense, and a $36 million increase in incentives. This was due to the acquisition of Swett & Crawford and higher overall volume. Excluding acquisitions, FTEs were lower by 276. Merger-related and restructuring charges increased $69 million. We also had $29 million in restructuring charges related to severance and real estate write-downs. In addition, other expense increased $33 million, mostly due to operating charge-offs, charitable contributions, and travel expense. Our effective tax rate was 30%, slightly below expectations due to the tax benefit this quarter. We expect the third quarter effective tax rate to be about 31%. Going forward, our expenses will include an $11 million quarterly increase with the FDIC insurance premiums. Even with this increase, we expect expenses to decline 1% to 2% mostly due to cost saves from recent acquisitions, excluding merger-related and restructuring charges. We are still targeting to generate positive operating leverage in the second half of 2016. Turning to slide 13. Capital ratios remain very healthy with a fully phased in common equity Tier 1 of 9.8%. Our LCR was 135%, and our liquid asset buffer at the end of the quarter was very strong at 13.7%. Finally, we were pleased to receive a non-objection to our capital plan. As a result, we will seek board approval to increase our quarterly dividend to $0.30 per quarter, and initiate a share repurchase program in the third quarter, repurchasing up to $160 million of our shares. Now, let's look at segments, beginning on slide 14. Before I walk through the Community Banking segment, I would note that National Penn is not included. Now that the conversion is complete, those results will become part of our segment reporting next quarter. Net income totaled $294 million, a decrease of $7 million from last quarter, and up $63 million from second quarter of last year. Net interest income increased $5 million from the first quarter, and $188 million from the second quarter of 2015. A little more than half of the increase was driven by Susquehanna. Turning to slide 15. Residential Mortgage Banking net income totaled $44 million, up $5 million from last quarter, driven by higher gains on residential mortgage loan production and sales. Production mix was 57% purchase and 43% refi, similar to last quarter. Looking to slide 16. Dealer Financial Services totaled $51 million, up $9 million, mostly due to lower charge-offs in Regional Acceptance. Our subprime auto portfolio totaled $3.4 billion, and losses totaled 6% in the quarter, a significant improvement. Net charge-offs for the prime portfolio remained excellent at 15 basis points. Turning to slide 17. Specialized Lending net income totaled $61 million, up $5 million from last quarter. This was driven mostly by loan and production growth in both Sheffield and equipment finance, as well as good strong production in Grandbridge, our commercial mortgage business. Looking at slide 18. Insurance services net income totaled $44 million, down $9 million from last quarter. Non-interest income totaled $465 million, up $44 million mostly driven by the addition of Swett & Crawford and higher P&C and life commissions, partially offset by seasonally lower employee benefit commissions. Non-interest expense increased $58 million, mostly due to Swett & Crawford. Going forward, we will continue to focus on achieving both cost savings and the revenue synergies from Swett & Crawford acquisition. Turning to slide 19, Financial Services segment had $87 million in net income up $60 million from last quarter. This was largely driven by a provision decrease of $84 million related to charge-offs and increased reserves in the energy portfolio last quarter. Corporate Banking generated 24% loan growth, and Wealth had 14% loan and 16% transaction deposit growth. In summary for the quarter, we achieved excellent credit quality, a relatively stable net interest margin, the successful restructuring of some of our corporate real-estate, and as Kelly mentioned earlier, successful conversion of National Penn. We're working hard to achieve synergies and efficiencies from our merger partners. With a steady outlook for loan growth and tight controls on our core expenses, we're setup to have a strong second half of 2016. Now let me turn it back over to Kelly for closing thoughts and Q&A. Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Daryl. So in summary, it was a solid quarter from an organic and a strategic perspective. We're pleased with earnings up 19%, record revenue of 18%, loan growth was very good, given the challenging environment, deposits were excellent. National Penn has been converted in a very, very excellent manner. We're executing on the cost saves from that and continuing with Susquehanna. M&A, as we said, is off the track, off the table, so we are focusing on our expense management. We're very pleased with our shareholder friendly capital plan, with the 7% increase in dividends and proposed buybacks. And so, in this type of environment, we think the most important think to focus on is to execute with precision, generating all the revenues that we can generate out of our businesses. Having made a number of investments over the past several years, we have a lot of opportunities in our various businesses, so a lot of opportunity there. Huge opportunity to continue to focus on rationalizing our cost structure, which is our primary focus at this time. So, let me turn that over to Alan now for Q&A. Alan Greer - Executive Vice President- Investor Relations : Okay, thank you, Kelly. At this time, we'll begin our Q&A session. Levy, if you would come back on the line and explain how our listeners may participate by asking a question. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. Daryl N. Bible - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Good morning. Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: If I could follow up on the expense outlook, a very modest decline from the second quarter. I guess, first, did the conversion of National Penn, was that a little bit sooner than you had thought, for some reason I thought it could be later in the quarter, is that driving cost saves coming a little bit sooner than you had expected? Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Matt, it was about what we had planned. Early on we said, the second quarter, but then as we went along, we realized we'd get it done at the very first part. And so, yeah, relative to in the very beginning when we announced it, it was earlier and that did accelerate some of the cost saves. That's really good for us, but that's what drove that. Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just my follow-up is on the underlying expense trends at kind of call it core BB&T, maybe you could give us an update there. I know there had been some ramp-up, maybe a year ago or so, and then hope that some of those costs would run off. Maybe give us an update on how those are trending and the outlook there? Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So generally, Matt, what's happening is exactly what we had projected. If you go back to two or so years ago, again just speaking into core area, we started a pretty major rebuild of our backroom with three major projects, our new general ledger system, which is now completed, our new commercial loan system, which is about 75% completed, and our new state-of-the-art data center, which is complete and getting ready to open. So there have been substantial upfront expenses and time commitment with regard to all of those. We're now heading into the period of time over the next year or so as that will crest, and then we'll begin to get the benefits on a relative basis. Two kinds of benefits, one will be, you will see relatively less expenses forward versus what we just invested in the previous periods, and then we'll begin to, and this will take two years, three years, but we'll begin to get the efficiencies out of these new investments, which will be meaningful over a long-term point of view. So the core fundamental operating expenses of BB&T are poised to improve as we go forward. We're not making any grand big promises for the third quarter and that kind of thing. It was not the way we operate. But in terms of our focus today with the major projects underway and substantially complete, and with our intense focus on continued reconceptualization, we feel good about expense management going forward. Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning. Daryl N. Bible - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Good morning. Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Betsy. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I wanted to ask about the loan growth, and there are couple of questions here. One is, you came in towards the higher end of your range, just wanted to understand what's going on in C&I that drove some of that. It looks like to me that what else is going on? And then just bigger picture, how you think about the growth in the specialized services relative to the rest of the portfolio. Are you comfortable with allowing the specialized services growth to be a such high delta relative to the rest of the portfolio? Does it matter for RWA; does it matter for capital return longer term? Clarke R. Starnes III - Chief Risk Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Betsy, this is Clarke. Regarding the C&I growth that was centered primarily much like the industry in our large corporate lending area. We still have a relative base to our peers, and we continue to have expansion in our verticals, so that you saw a lot of growth there. This quarter our mortgage warehouse lending with low rates, that certainly seasonally moved into public finance area, in our dealer floor plan. So it wasn't any one area, it was pretty much across the board, but it was slanted toward more the corporate side. As far as our Specialized Lending area, we have said that other than subprime auto we would expect those platforms to grow relatively faster than the core bank. Now we are purposely constraining the growth in the subprime sector to make sure it doesn't grow any faster than the core bank, so we don't increase our relative exposure there. But we believe those specialized lending areas even with higher RWA still represent with the yields a very strong risk return advantage for us. So we want to be sure we do that in a measured fashion, but we certainly would expect those to grow relatively faster than the core. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And does it matter from an RWA perspective, or it's just too small to matter really as it relates to RWAs? Daryl N. Bible - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Yeah, it really doesn't impact our risk weighted assets that much, Betsy. They're good quality loans, and they're consumer portfolio, so they really don't hang around very long to figure they'll go on non-accrual. So I would say there is really minimal impact here. Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Low variability, high resiliency in those portfolios. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we'll go to our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Management. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning, Kelly, good morning Daryl. Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey Gerard. Daryl N. Bible - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Good morning. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Kelly, you guys obviously put out very good return on average tangible common equity number today, 14.3%. The return on average shareholders equity was basically flat at 8.2%. Can you share with us how you expect to get that 8.2% higher, and if we assume cost of equity capital is around 9% to 10%, how do you surpass that in the next 12 months or 18 months? Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, Gerard, as you know, I think that's a grand question for all of us in the industry today. Pre-crisis we and the other good banks were operating at about 15%. You got to start from kind of the top. Way I think about it is about 2% kind of right off the top because of higher capital. And then, you've got about 1% to 1.5%, which is just the economy, margins, et cetera, and then the difference really is in increased regulatory costs and some technological cost. So from the capital point of view, we're going to continue to try to manage our capital efficiently, but it's going to stay high compared to past period. So that 2% at least for the short run is kind of non-retrievable, but that gets us to, say, 13%. So the 1% to 1.5% in terms of economy, obviously, can come back, and come back quickly, depending on the growth rates in the economy and the margins. We're not counting on that, but I personally think the flat rate scenario that everybody projecting is overstated. The underlying strength of our economy is not great, but it's good. Fed, I believe, clearly knows they need to raise rates, and I think they will the minute they see a window, which could still easily happen at least one rate increase towards the fall. And then the whole thing about regulatory and technological cost is about becoming efficient; scale is part of that, and then they just need to settle in that we have put into place. And then finally, Gerard, I would say, this is a brave new world. You can't run a bank today the way you did 5 years, 10 years, 15 years ago. Everything has to be re-conceptualized. We have a very intense focus right now on looking at our businesses, and here's kind of how I've asked our people to approach it. I'm saying go back 20 years ago when things were pretty good, and take a look at what our structure was then and examine anything today that we're doing that we weren't doing 20 years ago. If it's something that we are doing that we're absolutely required to do by regulation, then obviously we have no choice. If it's something that has evolved, or creeped into the structure, which can happen when times are fairly good, then it is suspect. And so we're going to examine every one of those in terms of the economic productivity. And I suspect that we will find material changes. So we will be restructuring the business. We already have a number of things underway. I'm not quite ready to announce it this morning. But we have a number of things that we're working on, not going to be any big grand announcements, not going to be any big grand announced cost saving plans; that's not our style. But you can count on the fact that we are laser focused on running our business as efficiently and getting those returns up. I frankly think in the bottom line, Gerard, that it's a material change, and that over the next couple of years, I certainly think we'll be in the 10% range over the next couple of years, and covering cost of capital. I don't have any concerns about that. From 10% to 12% or 13% is more difficult, as I've described, and somewhat circumstantial based on what's going on in the world, but we will be in the top tier of the performing banks based on the then existing circumstances. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. As a follow-up question to, Daryl, you pointed out on slide 10 that the interest rate sensitivity of the balance sheet has increased due to the acquisition. Do you expect to keep it at this level, or do you think you'll bring it down in the second half? Daryl N. Bible - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : You know me, Gerard, I've been doing this my whole career, asset liability management, and really not a big believer in taking one big position one way or the other. We really want to be slightly asset sensitive, and just trying to invest, balance and diversify over time. You really can't project interest rates, and if you do guess right and get interest rates right once, what are you going to do the next time around. I mean, you just can't do it. I mean, our job is to produce predictable and repeatable earnings. So we will continue to invest our securities, derivatives and all that to keep very balanced approach. We'll try to stay slightly asset sensitive, and that number might move around a little bit, but you're not going to see any big change out of us. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thank you, gentlemen. Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You bet. Operator : And we'll go next to John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Stephen Moss - Evercore ISI : Good morning. It's actually Steve Moss for John. I want to circle back to the efficiency and the expenses, your expense plans. Wondering if you could provide updated thoughts on the efficiency ratio for 4Q 2016 and also 2017? Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Steve, I've mentioned this before on these calls. I know everybody likes to be hyper-focused on the efficiency ratio, and we're willing to talk about it. But remember that it is a ratio, and so we have a lot of visibility in terms of the numerator, but we don't have as much visibility in terms of the denominator, that is revenues. Obviously if we did nothing today with our expenses, and the economy got better and margins got better, our efficiency ratio would go down. I mean, you wouldn't give us any credit for that, but that's what would happen. Conversely, if you have a period where revenues go down, maybe if you're doing a great job on expenses, then your efficiency ratio goes up, you will blame us for that. So I think that efficiency ratio is taken out of context. Having said that, we think we are generally on a downward trajectory with regard to the efficiency ratio. We're just not going to be able to give you exactly what this could be quarter-by-quarter. We think for the rest of this year and into next year, it will be down. Our intermediate term, I'll call that two years to three years to get into the 56%, 57% range, assuming reasonableness with regard to revenues, which I think will happen. And that will be very good. That will be a top performing level of efficiency. We're not trying to drive expenses so low that we put revenues at risk. And so, I'm very, very confident about our ability to execute on a very efficient organization, and I think that will show up as a very slow, but methodical decline in the efficiency ratio. Stephen Moss - Evercore ISI : Okay. Good. And then with regard to commercial real estate, just wondering what your appetite for growth is there, and if there are any markets you may be pulling back from? Clarke R. Starnes III - Chief Risk Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Yeah, Steve, this is Clarke. We feel really good about the quality of the underwriting of what we're putting on our books today and have been doing. We saw some additional growth this quarter, a lot of that was, we're not seeing projects go out across the industry quite as fast as the secondary markets, so some of that was more around the velocity of outflows. But we are trying to be a little more measured in certain segments. We think, for example, multi-family and hospitality might be peaking or have peaked. We don't want to get ahead of the market fundamentals in any asset class. So we do not want to wake up with more concentration if there are issues in the future. So I think you will see us be a little more measured in those sectors, and in CRE in general, although we certainly take care of good high quality clients. So, for us, we are a little concerned about some of those asset classes, and we are watching specific markets and submarkets very closely. So no particular market per se individually, but just in general, the fundamentals for each of the areas we operate in. Stephen Moss - Evercore ISI : Great. Thank you very much. Clarke R. Starnes III - Chief Risk Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Thanks. Operator : And we'll go to our next question from John McDonald with Bernstein. John Eamon McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning, guys. I was looking for a little perspective on the CCAR this year, you went in, looking to do more on capital return due to the hiatus on M&A and your new approval reflects that. Just wondering on the actual numbers, how did your process land on the $640 million buyback, and what looks like the total payout probably in the mid $60 million range? Daryl N. Bible - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Yeah, John. When we went through the process, you go through and you really evaluate your risks in the company, you run your stress models. The CCAR 2015, we actually used up over 100% of our capital, so our capital ratios came down a little bit. So when we did CCAR 2016, we wanted to make sure our capital ratio stayed above 10% in tangible common Tier 1, which is really what we're targeting. So you'll see us slowly accrete even with the repurchase and dividend increase, a little bit more capital over this next four quarters, probably around 20 basis points or so, which is exactly what we planned for. If you look at our (40:00) in total in 2016 versus 2015, it's basically 5% higher. I know we did an extra acquisition and all of that, but the actual (40:10) that we came in with, came in a little bit higher overall, if you don't count the acquisitions. John Eamon McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And Daryl, just on your NIM outlook, could you give a little bit of color on the puts and takes on the core NIM holding flat, and then the purchase accounting drag on the reported NIM, you mentioned for next quarter. How many more quarters beyond this would you still have that? Daryl N. Bible - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : In our slide, we show you GAAP margin and we show you core margin; we feel very good that core margin has stabilized. Most of our assets for the most part have been repriced. With the flatter curve, you've seen a little bit pressure on some longer assets like security investments there, but we're also still bringing down our deposit cost a little bit. You saw those come down a couple of basis points. So we feel pretty good that core margin will be pretty stable for the foreseeable future. On the GAAP side, it's basically the difference is purchase accounting. And you're going to see \u2013 if we did no other acquisition, whatsoever, GAAP will converge to core over several years, and there will be a trajectory down over time. I wouldn't say, it's going to be steep, but just by definition, it's got to come in if we don't do any more acquisitions. John Eamon McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, great. And just to clarify, did you say earning assets flat next quarter, so NII is growing a little bit or what would you... Daryl N. Bible - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Yeah, yeah. So earning assets are a little bit flat, on a linked quarter basis, because when we purchase, close Nat Penn, we pre-bought their securities, and so their security portfolio, so we were a little bit big in the second quarter. So our securities will right size this quarter be around $46 billion, $47 billion in total. So that will come down a little bit. But that will be more than offset in the loan growth side. You actually get a positive mix change there, because you're getting higher yielding assets on the loan side versus what we're giving up on the security side. John Eamon McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks. Daryl N. Bible - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Okay. Operator : And our next question comes from Jennifer Demba with SunTrust. Jennifer Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Question on your M&A hiatus. How long do you think that hiatus will last, and what would cause you to get back into the acquisition game, sooner than maybe expected? Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, Jennifer, we've not projected an exact timeframe, and the reason is because there is no exact timeframe. The fact is we're going to stay focused on expense management and improving our profitability and hopefully resulting in improvement in our relative stock price, until it's done. And people push me in a corner, I'll say it's longer than 90 days and less than five years, and that's about as close as I can give you. And I'm not going to try to do any less than that. I just won't. Our shareholders understand we are not going to do M&A, until we feel good about executing on what we already have invested in. Recall we bought $35 billion worth of assets over the last year and a half, and we got plenty of work to do to right size that, and get the returns for our shareholders. So I think where we are, I think this is where we're going to be, and is just really that simple. Jennifer Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you very much. Operator : And we'll go next to Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : Thanks. Daryl, I had a couple of very kind of technical specific questions. When you look at the postretirement benefit, you had $55 million fee income increase, $40 million in expenses, did that $15 million drop to the bottom line? And then, I think you talked about that also affecting the insurance sub-segment, where you saw expenses outpacing revenue, so I just had to know if there was some operating leverage in that segment, that maybe there was some noise that you're going to eventually see. So I just wanted to see those two things, and see if they are connected in anyway. Daryl N. Bible - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Yeah, Marty, I appreciate it. It's confusing. If you go back to the first quarter, the deferred comp pieces in the first quarter of every year there's always a piece that goes into net interest income. That was $15 million. That only happens once a year, and it's basically a result of the investments done in mutual funds. So that really balances it out. So you have the $15 million, and then the $55 million and $40 million kind of all balance out. As far as the insurance business goes, when you bring that in, net-net day one, just their efficiency costs versus the bank, they're just a little bit higher overall, but Chris and his team are working really hard in achieving cost saves and synergies. I don't know if you want to comment? Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. That's right, especially with Swett. We talked about a $30 million synergy opportunity. We've already actioned half of that. We won't \u2013 we'll probably realize about little less than a third of it this year, but the balance will come next year after we convert in the first quarter. But if you look back at our business over the last, say, four years, what you'll see is a relatively stable declining efficiency. So we're always trimming and pruning, but the acquisition does give us a really good opportunity to try to take the efficiency up or down. What I would also say about Swett is it's gone exceptionally well. In fact, I can't think of one that has gone any better. We have no revenue distractions and our margin, just after having them in three months, is actually better than it was last year. So all things going really well with Swett & Crawford. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : And then, mortgage, Daryl, the mortgage-backed security rate actually went up this quarter. We've been seeing a lot of impacts on prepayment speeds and some amortization of premium because that's kind of the bonds you've been having to buy. I think it didn't have an impact on you this quarter. And then also, was there any servicing valuation adjustments embedded in your mortgage banking number for the quarter? Daryl N. Bible - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Yeah, so on the investment portfolio, you are correct and that the agency securities we've been buying, we've been buying at premiums. We're very disciplined to try to have a handle of one or two or less if at all possible. We did actually have an advantage. Now, if you go back to the crisis, we got a lot of non-agency securities back then at discounts. So we, overall, you go back quarter-after-quarter, we've been relatively balanced where the premiums on the higher quality agencies have been offset by the non-agency securities. This quarter was the big drop in interest rates. We actually saw a slight benefit in the guidance that were at a discount, the non-agency guys were prepaying faster and we were accreting more, and that's kind of that duration adjustment you saw come through. So we actually had a slight benefit in the security yields. As far as mortgage banking income goes, is that what your other question? Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : That was, servicing valuations. Daryl N. Bible - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Servicing valuations. Our servicing valuations really haven't improved, or it's within a couple of basis points to what it's been of late. Now on a go forward basis, pricing has expanded. And as pricing expands and rates continue to fall, you might see an increase on a perspective basis in valuations. But right now, you look at our historical numbers and what we reported were pretty much status quo. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : Thanks. Daryl N. Bible - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Yeah. Operator : And our next question comes from Stephen Scouten with Sandler O'Neill. Stephen Kendall Scouten - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Hey, guys. Thanks. Don't mean to continue to ask questions that have maybe already been answered on expenses, but just as it pertains to the Nat Penn cost saves in particular, would there be any of those cost saves, or any material cost saves that have already been realized, or is still the bulk of that to come kind of 3Q and 4Q? Daryl N. Bible - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : The cost saves that we announced was a total of $60 million. My guess is we're probably a quarter of the way through, probably kind of $15 million right now. Stephen Kendall Scouten - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : And that would have already shown up in the 2Q numbers, or those were just completed late in the quarter? Daryl N. Bible - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : I would say some of that would be in the 2Q numbers. I mean whenever you announce an acquisition, you don't want it to happen, but people just start looking for other opportunities. And you saw some attrition out of National Penn as it got closer and closer to close. So you saw some of those cost saves come through a little early. Stephen Kendall Scouten - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay, great. And maybe just on the growth that you're seeing in Consumer Lending, specifically maybe some of the specialty sectors there, any concerns there longer term from increasing that exposure on the credit front? I know there was maybe some seasonal just kind of weakness on the consumer side here in 2Q, but any kind of longer-term apprehension about increasing that exposure? Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Stephen, I just remind you that we strategically invested in those businesses, about 15 years or 20 years ago. We believe we have very proven, stable, sustainable platform. So our underwriting servicing approaches to these areas are very consistent. You'll see what we have experienced over the years is competitors come and go and we try to avoid reaching when they come in, and we just stay the course. And so for us, it's back to we take a long-term approach to this with a very measured view on growth and we don't try to hyper-accelerate it in any period. So I would say we don't see any big change in our strategy. Stephen Kendall Scouten - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay. Great. And maybe one last quick thing is on the provision, you mentioned kind of net charge-off plus provisioning for new growth. Would that be kind of a 1% provision on new growth, or how do you think about provisioning for the new loan growth? Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : More or less similar to the absolute reserve rate that we have on the total portfolio. So I think marginally for growth about what our allowance percentage is today. Stephen Kendall Scouten - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Great. Thanks so much guys. I appreciate the clarity. Operator : And we'll go to our next question from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just, Kelly, I wanted to follow up on your comments about the efficiency ratio. Last quarter you mentioned that you were confident in getting the efficiency ratio in the fourth quarter down to sort of the 57%-ish level. It sounds like from your comments earlier today that you're getting \u2013 that you're not going to be quite as specific about that going forward. I just wanted to make sure that I heard that correctly. Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You did. And the reason is because when we made that comment last quarter, we were assuming certain projections with regard to the denominator, revenue level, and the revenue level because the economy is just a little bit softer. So it just makes that a little bit harder to get to that, maybe to 57%, 58% level. I'm hedging a bit, to be honest, because if revenues come in stronger, we might hit that. But I'm mostly trying to say that this is not that kind of a precision ratio that you can project with absolute certainty. So I'm not saying anything in terms of our taking away from our commitment to expenses. We hit our expense number for the second quarter. We will be able to do exactly what we said in conceptually with regard to expenses for the next several quarters; and the ratios will pop around based on what happens to the revenue. Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Understood. And then just a question on the insurance business, which you mentioned ex-acquisition over the past year is up about 1% in terms of revenue. I'm curious in the newly acquired markets, I guess, specifically Susquehanna, are you seeing greater traction in those markets in terms of your ability to get into those markets and sell insurance products, or is it at this point a little too early to tell? Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That's a fair question. It is up about 1% common quarter, year-to-date it's actually up closer to 1.4%, 1.5%. So it was both Susquehanna and National Penn, which is unusual. We picked up small retail agencies. So they already had agencies in market. They're not big enough long term. We'll have to add to that chassis. But they are very excited about the horsepower their overall agency brings, and we'll be able to bring much larger variety of product like aviation, performance payment bonds, access to things they never had before, they'll get through our franchise. But it does take some time, but I would say that we're already in the market, rattling the sabre, and there is a lot of excitement, and we would anticipate more momentum as we go in that market; just like we would and will for example. Good insight. Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks for taking my question. Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Operator : We'll go to our next question from Paul Miller with FBR & Company. Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Hey, on a follow-up on that. Thanks a lot guys. And a follow-up on that question, you've been in Philly, you've been in Philly now for over a year. What are some of the opportunities that you see there that maybe you didn't see when you first entered the market? Because everybody is always talking about how Philly is a very tough market for outsiders. Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So from a general point of view, Paul, the receptivity we've had in Philly has been fantastic. We are a top 10 U.S. bank, and we have very, very good capabilities to help medium size, larger businesses. And the people there frankly like us. I mean we are very well received in terms of our culture and our style of doing business, and so the receptivity has been very strong. And keep in mind that with National Penn and Susquehanna, while they have good relationships with a lot of the players in that market, they haven't had the capacity to be able to meet a lot of their needs. So the hardest part in those kind of relationships is developing trust with the leaders of the companies, the CEO and the CFO. We have that kind of trust and relationship built up for years and years and years through our people up there and all of our people are in place. And so now what we have to do is lever those trust and relationships with our additional capacity. So early feedback from our people is frankly very, very positive. Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Okay. Hey, guys. Thank you very much. Operator : And we'll go to our next question from Christopher Marinac with FIG Partners. Christopher William Marinac - FIG Partners LLC : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Kelly and Daryl, I was wondering if you could elaborate on the ability to organically grow in markets that are tangent towards BB&T, whether that's in Pennsylvania, Ohio or really other parts of the Southeast? Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Chris, I think that Pennsylvania obviously is a major growth for us, but as far as growing tangentially, we're not focused on it trying to grow really around our footprint. The only exception to that I would say is, we are now in Ohio technically through Cincinnati. We'll certainly spring forward through our Corporate Banking efforts up into all of the major markets in Ohio. But frankly, we've been working on that for a while anyway. As you know, our Corporate Banking initiative is a national platform anyway. So you're probably talking specifically about retail, and we do not expect any retail movement outside of the existing defined footprint for a period of time. We've got a lot of work to do in all the areas we're in, and that's where we will stay focused. Christopher William Marinac - FIG Partners LLC : Okay. So the digital banking efforts really it's hard to push those beyond the current borders of the footprint? Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think as digital transformation \u2013 that's an insightful question, digital transformation continues to occur, there will be the possibility of expanding beyond your footprint, obviously not through branches, but through pure social media and other techniques with regard to expanding digitally. That's why, Chris, last year we named one of our new executive management members as our Chief Digital Officer. He has assembled his team. He is aggressively working on what is our strategy with regard to expanding digital within our \"geographical footprint\" but much broader than that. So it is \u2013 that will be a much broader footprint initiative. Christopher William Marinac - FIG Partners LLC : Great, Kelly. Thank you for the feedback. I appreciate it. Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You bet. Operator : And we'll go next to \u2013 we'll take our final question from Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Nancy Avans Bush - NAB Research LLC : Good morning, Kelly. This might be a good way to end. I'm listening to your guidance about expenses, and you said that there would be \u2013 the efficiency ratio would have a downward trajectory, but you can't predict quarter-by-quarter. We've got one significant piece of news this morning and it's apparently Jamie Dimon and Warren Buffett and Larry Fink and some others have gotten together, they are going to put forth a set of principles, I guess, for corporate governance or corporate behavior, and one of them is a lessened emphasis on quarterly guidance. And I would contend that the banking industry has probably been one of the ones most negatively impacted by the need to guide on a quarterly basis. Can you just reflect on that and can you envision a time in which your company would not give quarterly guidance? Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, Nancy, it's good to hear from you, and obviously I just heard that announcement this morning as you did, but I really agree with where they are coming from. I think that businesses in general and the banking industry in particular are doing an injustice frankly to the market at large and to our own shareholders, in terms of trying to be that specific, in terms of projecting quarter-to-quarter. It just makes no sense. That's the way, it's always been. And so, we've kind of fallen into that trap. But as you've heard me say over the last year or so, I've been trying to dislodge us from just talking about efficiency ratios and things like that because of exactly what Jamie and them are talking about. So we will definitely follow us along with that momentum, and yes, I can foresee us not giving guidance. Frankly, what I like to say to our shareholders is that, my pledge to you is that we are going to work really hard to provide a good long-term growing, steady, less volatile total shareholder return that will be a top tier type performance. That's about as far as I think we're ought to give. And then, they measure us over time, and if they like what we do, they buy more stock, they don't they sell. Nancy Avans Bush - NAB Research LLC : Okay. All right. Thank you very much. It's an interesting concept and I hope, it develops as well. It's just hard to see at this point, how we would get from here to there. There would have to obviously be a transitional time, particularly for the banking industry to put forth certain ratios or whatever that would be the guiding principle. But anyway, let's keep hoping. Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think that folks like you that are well respected in the industry can help. And I think, the major banks, I'm glad that Jamie is on board, and I think if all the major banks will start moving in that direction, I think, you will see it move very quickly. Nancy Avans Bush - NAB Research LLC : Thank you. Kelly S. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks. Have a good day. Operator : And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Greer, at this time, I would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Alan Greer - Executive Vice President- Investor Relations : Okay. Thank you, Levy, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. This concludes our call. If you have further questions, please don't hesitate to contact Investor Relations. Thank you, and I hope you have a good day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Good morning everybody, and thanks to joining our call. So overall, I think we had a very strong performance quarter. We have record quarterly earnings, and we did complete a few strategic agreements which will benefit future quarters, which I\u2019ll describe. Have net income of $599 million, which is up 21.7% versus 2015, and 42.7% annualized versus second quarter \u201916. Our diluted EPS was $0.73, up 14% versus the third and up 42% annualized versus the second. And if you just -- which I will cover again if you adjust EPS, it totaled $0.76 excluding merger-related and restructuring charges on a few other items on slide four. GAAP ROA, ROE and ROTCE were 1.15%, 8.87% and 15.20%, which I think reverse filing in this environment. Taxable-equivalent revenues totaled $2.8 billion, up 13.1% versus third of \u201915 and 3.9% versus the second quarter \u201916 on annualized basis. I\u2019m very pleased that our net interest margin declined only 2 basis-points to 3.39%, and our core net interest margin increased to 3.17%, and Daryl will give you a lot more color on that just a little bit. Our GAAP efficiency ratio improved to 61.7% versus 65.4% in the second quarter of \u201916. Our adjusted efficiency ratio improved to 58.7% versus 59.6% in the second quarter. Importantly, non-interest expenses were $1.7 billion, a decrease of 19% versus second quarter annualized. Average loans and leases held for investment totaled $141.3 billion in the third quarter, which was up just slightly compared to the second quarter. We do continue to have significant run-off in our residential mortgage portfolio and prime auto based on some very clear strategic decisions that we have made. Actually though we had a respect 2.2% annual growth. And so I think it's pretty good, consistent with the economic growth, and I\u2019ll talk a bit more about that in a minute. NPA did continue a slight decrease of 4.9%. We did settle a loss share agreements with the FDIC. Recall that we had loss share agreement on that 2009 acquisition of Colonial. We incurred an $18 million in other charge this quarter, but it will result in future benefits with regard to earnings. We did settle a dated FHA-insurance loan matter, and we made $50 million charitable contribution which will reduce expenses in future quarters. And as indicated, we did repurchased $160 million of outstanding shares. Now slide four, the selected items that are related to the merger-related restructuring charges was $43 million pre-tax or $0.03 negative impact to diluted EPS. Charitable contribution was $50 million pre-tax, which was $0.04 dilution of EPS. On the other hand, we had settlement of FHA-insurance loan matters net of recoveries, which was a positive $73 million or $0.05, and then determination of the FDIC loss share agreement, $18 million, I mentioned, was a penny. So, if you net those out, it was $0.03 net negative impact on EPS, recall though that was selected items. If you go to slide five, a few comments with regard to loans. As I said, they were up slightly, 0.3%. But for several quarters now we have indicated to you that we have been allowing our residential portfolio at the Company to decline, that\u2019s a strategic decision. Recall that the mix of our business, expectations with regard to rising rates and the spreads frankly in that business. So the risk adjustment return is not at a level we would like would it be on a marginal basis. And so we will that run-off and the sales for now it's in the prime portfolio. We did restructure some quarters ago to a flat program that program transition, it's actually going very well. The old portfolio is running off today, but frankly the new portfolio is growing also more profitable. So we feel good about that, but it does show a loan decline. So again, net adjusted 2.2%. We did have some key very strong performances on a seasonal basis, which we\u2019d expect from some of our specialized lending businesses; Premium Finance was up 57.1 annualized; Sheffield up 21.3 annualized; Regional Acceptance is up 15.5 annualized and revolving credit was up 9.6. So, you can see that, while we\u2019re being very careful with regard to our basic commercial portfolio, our specialized lending portfolio has continued to do very, very well. Now, we like all the others did experienced higher pay-offs in our commercial area in the quarter. Frankly, a lot of good quality loans have just been refied out into the market, because of, I think, participants expectations that rates are going up, so they have gone out and taken advantage of long-term loan markets. That\u2019s not a long-term change in terms of the commercial lending productivity. It\u2019s just a temporary increase in pay-offs. Production in the pipelines in all still looks solid. And I\u2019ll remind you that we are very disciplined lender, we are just not doing cheap loans outside of our risk appetite. But real frankly, we could be growing faster but the risk adjusted return on equity is just unacceptable. So we\u2019re getting all that the market are giving, so we\u2019re not trying to beat the market that\u2019s not a good bit from a long-term point of view. On page six, our DDA growth continued to be very strong at 14.3%. We feel really good about that. We are increasing market share in most of our markets. And we continue to hold our costs at a very low 0.3%. So, our deposit business is doing extremely well and supporting the asset growth that we have. Let me turn it to Daryl for some additional detail, and then we\u2019ll have questions. Daryl Bible : Thank you, Kelly and good morning everyone. Today, I am going to talk about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, non-interest expense, capital and our segment results. Turning to slide seven, overall, we had a really good quarter with regard to credit quality. Net charge-offs totaled $130 million, up 9 basis-points from last quarter. This is mostly driven by expected seasonality in our retail portfolios, as well as returning to more normalized levels after a very low charge-off quarter. Loans 30 to 89 days past due increased $66 million, or 7.2%; again, mostly due to seasonality in our consumer related portfolios. NPAs decreased 4.9% to 38 basis-points. Excluding energy, NPAs have improved steadily in recent quarters. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect NPAs to remain in a similar range. We also expect net charge-offs to be in a range of 35 to 45 basis-points, assuming no unexpected deterioration in the economy. Continuing on slide eight, our energy portfolio totaled $1.3 billion, about 1% of total loans. Outstanding balances, total commitments, and non-accruals, all decreased from last quarter. And all non-performing borrowers are paying as grades. Allocated reserves increased to 11.5%. This is mostly due to the implementation of guidance from the recent shared national credit review that was received in early October. We continue to have good quality mix with less than 10% in oil-field services. Lastly, the reserve coverage per call, a very modest portfolio, rose to 13.7%. Turning to slide nine, our allowance coverage ratios remained strong at 2.91 times for net charge-offs and 2 times for NPLs. The allowance to loan ratio was 1.06%, flat compared to last quarter. Excluding the acquired portfolios, the allowance to loan ratio was 1.15%. So, our effective allowance coverage remained strong. As a reminder, our acquired loans have a combined mark of $670 million. We have recorded a provision of $148 million compared to net charge-offs of $130 million. Looking forward, our provision is expected to match charge-offs plus loan growth. Turning to slide 10, compared to last quarter, net interest margin was 3.39%, down 2 basis-points. Core margin was 3.17%, up 1 basis-point. The margin decrease mostly resulted from lower investment yields, which were down 15 basis-points. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect GAAP margins to decline 3 to 5 basis-points, driven by a reduction in benefits from purchase accounting. We expect core margin to remain essentially flat as lower rates will be offset by asset mix, funding cost and mix changes, and the possibility of a rate increase in December. Additionally, we expect average earning assets to decline by approximately $1 billion next quarter due to lower security balances. Asset sensitivity increased mostly due to growth in favorable funding sources and positive growth in shorter asset classes. Continuing on slide 11, non-interest income totaled $1.2 billion, up $34 million compared to last quarter. The fee income ratio improved to 41.9%. Looking at a few other changes in non-interest income; insurance income decreased $55 million, mostly driven by seasonal decline and property and casualty commissions; mortgage banking income increased $43 million, due to a net MSR valuation adjustment and higher production volumes. Other income decreased $10 million due to $14 million decrease in income related to assets pursuant for this employment benefit. And finally, we terminated our FDIC loss share agreements associated with Colonial. As a result, $18 million of expense was recognized in the third quarter. Going forward, no FDIC loss share expense will be recognized. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, total fee income is expected to be relatively flat as seasonally stronger insurance is expected to offset by this seasonal decline in mortgage banking income. Turning to slide 12, we had an excellent quarter in terms of expense management. Non-interest expenses totaled $1.7 billion, down $86 million or 19% versus last quarter. Personnel expense decreased $33 million, driven by a $14 million decline in post-employment benefit expense and a $10 million decline in insurance incentives expense due to seasonality. Merger-related and restructuring charges decreased $49 million, largely due to lower acquisition related charges. And last quarter\u2019s restructuring charges related to real-estate in the amount of $19 million. In addition other expense decreased $34 million, mostly due to the $73 million net benefit related to the settlement of certain FHA insured mortgage business. This is partially offset by a charitable contribution of $50 million. Going forward, excluding merger-related restructuring charges and unusual items, we expect expenses to decrease slightly in the fourth quarter. Turning to slide 13, capital ratios remained very healthy with a fully phased in common equity Tier 1 of 9.9%. Our LCR was up 122% and our liquid asset buffer was very strong at 13.6%. Finally, we will continue with our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter, repurchasing up to $160 million in our shares. Now, let\u2019s look at our segments, beginning on slide 14. Community Bank\u2019s net income totaled $338 million, an increase of $43 million from last quarter and up $78 million from third quarter of last year. Non-interest income increased $13 million driven by higher service charges on deposits, letters of credit, and bankcard fees. Majority of growth experienced in the Community Bank includes acquisition related. However, third quarter was our best commercial loan production for the year. Turning to slide 15, Residential Mortgage Banking net income totaled $117 million, up $73 million from last quarter, driven by net MSR valuation adjustments and higher saleable loan volume, as well as a net recovery from the settlement of FHA-insured loan matters. Production mix was 57% purchase and 43% refi, similar to last quarter. Gain on sale margins were slightly down 3 basis-points to 1.06 versus last quarter. Looking at to slide 16, dealer financial services income totaled $40 million, a decrease of $11 million compared to prior quarter. The provision for credit losses increased $18 million, mostly driven by loan growth as well as seasonally higher net charge-offs in the Regional Acceptance portfolio. Net charge-offs are still well within risk appetite of approximately 7%. Net charge-offs for the prime portfolio remain excellent at 19 basis-points.  Turning to slide 17, Specialized Lending net income totaled $64 million, up $3 million from last quarter. This was driven mostly by loan and production growth in both Sheffield and Equipment Finance, as well as strong production in Grandbridge, our commercial mortgage business. Looking at slide 18, Insurance Services net income totaled $23 million, down $21 million from last quarter. Non-interest income totaled $412 million, down $53 million, mostly driven by the seasonality and commercial property and casualty insurance. Non-interest expense decreased $21 million, mostly due to lower personnel expenses, operating charge-offs, and business referral expense. Turning to slide 19, the Financial Services segment had $83 million in net income, down slightly, mostly due to modest decline in Corporate Banking loan growth. While it\u2019s generated strong loan and deposit growth, 8.6% and 13.7% respectively compared to last quarter. Lastly, the provision increased of $26 million was largely driven by risk grade mix changes, partially offset by lower loan balances. In summary, for the quarter, we achieved solid growth in revenues, continued strong credit quality and a relatively stable net interest margin, and excellent expense control. Looking forward, we expect to improve outlook for loan growth, continue benign credit and solid expense control. Now let me turn it back over to Kelly for closing remarks and Q&A. Kelly King : Thanks, Daryl. So as you\u2019ve heard, we believe the quarter was an overall strong performance quarter. I would point out that our mergers are working really well, expenses are being rationalized market acceptance in all of our new markets is very, very good. And our Community Bank teams are executing extremely well in expense reduction and revenue productions. Loan growth in today\u2019s market to be honest is just very, very challenged. Still, Daryl indicated we do expect our loan growth to be in the 1% to 3% range as we look forward to the fourth quarter. And that\u2019s going to be based, we think, probably somewhat lower levels of pay-offs. And we keep looking at possibilities of asset purchases from some other institutions that are rationalizing their balance sheet. So, when you put it all together, we think that we\u2019ll be in the 1% to 3% range. And frankly, I expect much of an impact on the fourth quarter. But here in next year, I think the market is likely to get better, once we get through post elections. Part of what is going on in the third quarter and in turn that this kind of slowed down that everybody has talked about is there is just a lot of anxiety. I saw report a couple of days ago that 60%, or slightly less, but about 60% of the market it is really, really anxious about the elections. And I suppose we quite understand that. And so I think when all this subsides, however it goes, it will be less uncertainty and less anxiety, I think that will in still a bit more confidence then people will be a little bit more willing to invest, and make acquisitions and borrow money. So I think that\u2019s a bit on deposit side. We did have several good strategic agreements that have helped future earnings. We continue our system investments. And I\u2019ll point out, we did add three members to our executive management team. So, we feel good about where we are, and we, at BB&T, are building for the future. Now, I\u2019ll turn it to Alan. Alan Greer : Thank you, Kelly. LeAnn, at this time, if you will come back on the line and explain how our listeners may participate in Q&A session. Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And we\u2019ll take our first question from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : I just wanted to clarify the base for the expense run rate for next quarter. If I take out of course merger related and restructuring charges, as well as the FHA benefit and the charitable contribution, I get to base of $1.691 billion. Just want to make sure that was the right base, Daryl. And also, Kelly is it too early in the budgeting process to ask about progress on this level in 2017? Kelly King : Yes, Erika, I think you\u2019re spot on the $1.691 billion. Daryl Bible : Yes, so it is early as you pointed out in budgeting process. But we\u2019re being very, very intense about our expectations for next year. So, I am thinking as we look forward for next year for off of this base of expenses they\u2019re kind of flattish. So we do not see a material increase and some opportunities with a slight decrease. Erika Najarian : And my follow up question, Daryl, you mentioned an LCR of 122%. And also that you are going to offset some natural margin pressure next quarter with asset remixing. Other than the billion dollar in securities role offering next quarter, could you give us a little bit better sense on what those remixing strategies are? Daryl Bible : It\u2019s just our normal strategies of growing our loan book in specialized area as faster than the total loan book. So you have higher growth and higher earning assets from that side. On the funding side, we continue to get really strong growth in DDA, which is a free funding source which gives us positive. So I think we feel very confident that our core net interest margin will remain stable even with these low rates. The GAAP margin just has pressure coming down as our purchase accounting runs-offs over the next couple of years. Operator : And our next question comes from John Mcdonald with Bernstein. John Mcdonald : Daryl, just to follow-up on that. What\u2019s your outlook on, in terms of NII dollars, the ability to grow all-in reported NII dollars in the fourth quarter when you think about what\u2019s happening to the balance sheet and NIM? Daryl Bible : So, I would say, you have the same number of days in the fourth quarter as you do in the third quarter. Net interest income dollars will be down from third quarter, mainly due to a little smaller balance sheet as we reduce our securities portfolio. But we\u2019re really trying to optimize and get higher overall performance in the long run that set us up for 2017. We think where we want to position us that being more optimal in \u201917. And so, I\u2019d say dollar is probably down in that $20 and to $30 million range on a linked quarter basis. John Mcdonald : Could you leverage a little bit on the puts and takes for the outlook for core NIM to be flat. You mentioned the December hike. Do you assume that LIBOR will start to move up in anticipation you\u2019ll get some benefit in the fourth quarter from December hike? Daryl Bible : LIBOR, as you know, moved up with money market change that happened this month. LIBOR will continue to probably stay at relatively high levels as we cross over year-end. So that benefits us as we have a lot of loans still tied to the LIBOR rate. We have I think three times more assets that we do funding and liability starts that\u2019s to tied to LIBOR. So that should be a benefit for us. So I think we feel good. And in our forecast right now, we do have an increase in December. We aren\u2019t really forecasting anything out \u201917 right now, but we do have the increase in our forecast in mid-December. John Mcdonald : And the LIBOR sensitivity is on to one month, I assume, one month LIBOR? Daryl Bible : Majority of our assets are tied to one month. Our liabilities are tied more towards three months and one month. But there is a mix. Operator : And our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matthew O'Connor: Daryl, I was wondering if you could just elaborate a bit on why you expect securities to go down in 4Q. I guess we\u2019ve seen some pickup in the long-term rates. So, I would have thought that maybe reinvestment yields are a little more appealing now than say three-six months ago? Daryl Bible : I would say if we were to buy securities now, they still probably -- we\u2019re very conservative in what we buy. We buy treasuries, agencies, MBS, so all high quality. The yields are still no more than 2%, probably in the high 1s. We do feel that, from a liquidity perspective, our securities portfolio can shrink a little bit. We also feel really good that that will set us up, I think, for a strong 2017. And we\u2019ll have optimal opportunities that can higher performance numbers as things start to happen in \u201917. Matthew O'Connor: And then a question for, Kelly, just you mentioned there might be some opportunities for asset purchases from other banks. Just wondering if you could elaborate on that? Kelly King : Matt, I think what you\u2019re seeing is that everybody in this low environment taken a hard look at the structure of the balance sheets, and their ability to accumulate capital. And so like us, I think everybody is looking to risk adjusted return of asset starts business. So, if an institution has a relatively low capital base and not much growth opportunity, one of the best ways for them to improve their return on equity is to reduce certain assets. And so, if they have a particular asset that does, maybe they\u2019re high and they\u2019re mix in terms of their appetite with regard to that, they may chose to exit. We\u2019ve seen some of that. It\u2019s not a big deal out there, Matt, to be honest. But you\u2019re seeing some of it, and we are continuously looking into the market to take advantage of any of those that come about. Because as I said, our strategy is to grow from the organic market what make sense. And then the settlement of that with other opportunities that allow us to get to some additional growth. And that\u2019s one that we\u2019ve had some success we\u2019re doing this year and we think will have some success going forward. Matthew O'Connor: And then just on the whole bank deals still other market there? Kelly King : Yes, still lot of market. Operator : And our next question comes from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Kevin Barker : Thank you for taking my questions. I just want to follow-up in regard to your comments regarding the forward expenses. Kelly, I believe you mentioned that, that you expect them to be flattish, going into 2017. Is that on a operating number or is that on a total after taking into account the merger and restructuring charges during 2016? Daryl Bible : Kevin, this is Daryl. I\u2019ll answer. We really aren\u2019t giving a whole lot of guidance for \u201917 right now. We\u2019ll give much more or better clarity as we get into January and finish our planning process. But with Erika\u2019s question, our banks right now has a $1.691 billion. We expect that to be down a little bit this next quarter, call around 1%. And what Kelly said in \u201917 is we\u2019re going to try to hold that expense rate flat, maybe down a little bit. But we\u2019re going to do our best with all the competing priorities to keep our expenses relatively flat for \u201917. But we\u2019ll give you more color as things get finalized in from our operating plan. Kevin Barker : And then a follow-up on your strong mortgage banking quarter. How much of that, of the mark-up in your MSR, was hedged out and what was the net result of your higher MSR mark? Daryl Bible : Yes, good question, Kevin. So we had $33 million in MSR valuation income, $18 million was that valuation adjustment to the MSR. And every now and then you have to update and soon your prepayment models and basically our asset valuation was lagging peers that we index and looking again. So we had to adjust our prepayment models, which have allowed us to take that $18 million into the valuation adjustment. So, if you take that out, we had good hedge performance of $15 million and that was just good performance in the TBAs that we had that we\u2019re hedging. Kevin Barker : Did that have to do with the fact that the 10 year moved slightly higher during the quarter even though 30 year mortgage rates went down during the third quarter? Daryl Bible : We had benefit and the basis impact, yes. Operator : And our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Wanted to just see if you can give us a little bit more commentary around the loan growth expectation as you look into 2017, I know you\u2019re not giving a lot of guidance there. But just I know you indicated the guidance for fourth quarter and Kelly I know you cautioned a little bit around some lacked demand mid-market commercial borrowers, et cetera. So, how do you think that plays out for \u201917? And what type of general level of growth could we expect? Clarke Starnes : John, this is Clarke Stanes. I\u2019ll take that. Basically fact is Kelly mentioned our production was actually pretty good for the third quarter, not substantially different than what we have seen year-to-date. They\u2019ll be challenged with headwinds for the pay-off. So, assuming those pipelines continue to stay strong. And to Kelly\u2019s point, if we see some more clarity around political side of things, we may see more activity as we go into next year. But our view is we believe we can produce reasonable growth within our risk appetite around GDP plus 1% or 2%. So, given where you think the economy is going to grow, we think that we can grow a little bit faster than that. But we don\u2019t certainly believe we can -- its preview for us to get it well beyond that. John Pancari : And then my follow-up is around the efficiency ratio. Again, I know you\u2019re somewhat regarded on what type of expense guidance you give us. But how can we think about the efficiency ratio for 2017, borrowing any moves by the Fed? I know you\u2019re around 60% currently. Is it fair to assume that we can get to the high 50s without a move from the Fed? Thanks. Daryl Bible : When we got through the planning process, we always have our business lines planned positive operating leverage. We want them to stay within the risk appetite of what they\u2019re trying to accomplish. So, we\u2019re going to have a plan that puts the other positive operating leverage. So, hopefully, we will be able to generate and give improvement on efficiency. But we\u2019re really aren\u2019t guiding to any specific number. It's really going to depend on the execution and what the market will allow us and what we can grow from a revenue perspective. So we can control expenses. As Kelly said, we will be very tough on expenses and do what we think is right for the long-term benefit of our Company and our shareholders. Operator : And I\u2019ll take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Hi. Good morning, Kelly. Good morning, Daryl. Maybe, same question on a different topic. Kelly, maybe can you talk a little bit about the recent Tarullo speech, does it at all change the way you think about excess capital? And I guess, in addition, at this point, you\u2019re under 250 and hence no longer subject to the qualitative component. However, over the next few years, you would likely pass this. So, does this at all change the way you have thought about surpassing 250 million? I know historically you talked about a large strategic action would probably be likely. But you\u2019ve obviously made comments that that\u2019s of the table for now. So, just interested in what you thought of the speech and how you\u2019re thinking about excess cap -- how you\u2019re thinking about passing 250 million? Kelly King : Ryan, I think to go the speech it was very consistent with what he\u2019s been saying really for last two to three years. He\u2019d been I think appropriately moving to adjust some of the initial Fed criteria around CCAR. He clearly I think believe that CCAR process needs to be much tougher on the large systems versus large regional like BB&T. And so, I think he speak simply to some degree he codified his movement in that direction. But from our point of view, frankly, it does not change a lot, because we have a robust CCAR process. We\u2019re not going to dismantle it just because we wanted 250 million, that wouldn\u2019t make any sense. Number one, the way we\u2019re doing CCAR today, we actually benefit from it. We think it's a healthy process. And so, we would continue basically as it is in any way instead of drop there the whole requirements. But certainly we wouldn\u2019t drop it and they have to pick it back up if we did it strategically, it would put us out to 250 million. So, it was encouraging and that I think the signal is that the intensity of change with regard to really banks under I think 500 billion is just not going to increase. In fact, this is -- it's kind of stable. And as he said, the intensity of additional increased scrutiny is on the SIFIs, so that relatively is good news for us. Ryan Nash : Maybe just quickly sticking with the loan growth theme. Can you just maybe give us some comments around what you\u2019re saying in commercial real estate, particularly in multi-family and office where we\u2019ve heard some cautious comments on some of your peers, and what your expectations for growth there going forward? Thanks. Clarke Starnes : Ryan, this is Clarke again. Certainly, we are being more cautious in the CRE sector. The two areas that we\u2019re most cautious in right now is multi-family, because we believe that market may have peak or is peaking. There is a lot of projects in the pipeline. They\u2019re going to affect potentially absorption of vacancy and those sorts of things. So we\u2019re very careful to make sure we don\u2019t create a new concentration there in. We\u2019ll see some issues market-by-market. They will remain -- you see some of those symptoms. The other area is hospitality. We think that\u2019s also had a peak in likely to potentially have some over-capacity as we move forward. So what I\u2019m seeing is others sensing the same thing. And it is, the underwriting has clearly tightened and pricing increased for those that are still active in that space. But I think all the banks are being more cautious. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Ken Houston with Jefferies. Ken Houston : The question on your long-term debt and you FHL book, you have foreign change billion of pretty high class of staff underneath. And I was just wondering in terms of as you\u2019re kind of cleaning up some of the income statement and look out. Is there any opportunity to do some calls there and what would that entail if you were able to do that, would it be just able to be retired? Or could you just take a charge and move on, that\u2019s everything? Daryl Bible : Ken, we are constantly looking at our balance sheet, and always try to optimize our balance sheet. And what we are aware of what we have on our balance sheet on the long-term debt side. And potentially there could be some that we would evaluate as we enter into \u201917. No decision has been made. Nothing is final. But obviously there is potential opportunity there to maybe improve run rate and improve efficiency and returns. Ken Houston : And second just in terms of -- now that\u2019s what is in the numbers, I saw in the business line that it said that there really wasn\u2019t much organic growth. Can you just give us an update on the insurance business and help us understand the new run rate seasonality and just kind of what the organic growth outlook is for the insurance business? Thanks. ChrisHenson: Sure, Ken. It\u2019s Chris. I think, first off, is going very, very well. We are getting all the expenses of the synergies that we thought we would. We\u2019re probably half-way through that process, so the conversion will occur in February. But you\u2019re following us right in the organic growth, primarily due to pricing and excess capital in the market. It is generally in the 1% range. The fact if you look at us year-to-date, we would be growing right on 1%. And there are several factors, pricing is one. And if you look at the mix of businesses that we are in, the pure property and casualty business is probably down in the 1% to 2%. But the cap property, which is through our AmRisc business is probably down in the 15% to 20%. So on balance, we\u2019re probably down 4% to 5%. Existing client growth, however, is up. We actually saw the new business growth in the third quarter, which I would assume would be abnormal in the industry today, I think that speaks well to the revenue we\u2019re saying that we\u2019ve build over the years. And then you are likely to see our performance based payments, which is really based on your -- on account how you perform with your underwriters. The recent storm is really not large enough to create increases in pricing because there is so much excess capital. On the other hand it does part us just a little bit, it won\u2019t be significant on our performance payment. So run-rate, going forward, is think as we really put the business together, we\u2019ve got chance to continue to be positive and potentially accelerate if we get any economic pick-up. But I\u2019d say it's in that sort of 1 to 2% range, looking forward Operator : And our next question comes from Steve Moss with FBR. Steve Moss : Just wondering -- most of my questions have been asked. But I do want to follow-up on the investment securities balances. I was wondering if the 4Q 16 level you expect will be a good run rate for 2017, or if we should expect further declines? Daryl Bible : Steve, this is Daryl. I would say we\u2019ll continuing to run down we\u2019ll probably average our securities down another $2 billion give or take from where they were. So they were down about $1 billion linked-quarter, second to third, and maybe down about $2 billion linked quarter from third to fourth. Steve Moss : And then with regard to investment banking and brokerage fees, it was pretty stable quarter-over-quarter despite the closure of capital markets business. Wondering if you could quantify that, and the outlook for that business for the investment banking business? Chris Henson : This is Chris. I can take that. You\u2019re right. We did shut that down. Although, we\u2019re actually continuing to move forward in the M&A. And I would expect next quarter to be up slightly, maybe a 1% to 2% range until we digest all that and then accelerate from there. Operator : And our next question comes from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Jason Harbes : Good morning, guys. This is Jason Harbes, Matt\u2019s team. So I guess I just had a question on the expense guidance. So, the 1% decline, I think, you quantified. It sounds like that will roughly offset the anticipated decline in the spread income this quarter. And then with fees relatively flat, it should be relatively flat EPS in Q4, I guess is what the outlook is telling us. But just had a question on the credit guidance. So with the relatively stable net charge-offs and the expectation that you\u2019ll need to start provisioning for growth. Is there, just mechanically, any guidance, I guess, you can give us and how do think about the rate of reserve build for the anticipated loan growth? Clarke Starnes : Jason, this is Clarke Starnes. I think we put it on our deck. We believe our reserve rates are pretty much more or less at the bottom given where we are at this stage of the cycle as we come through the crisis and rebuild portfolios they\u2019re now seasoning. We\u2019ve been in the benign economy. So, we would not anticipate our reserve rate to go lower. So the way we think about it is the likely impact on provision is NPOs plus enough reserve build to maintain dollars, to maintain that reserve rate that we have today. So, that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it, at this point. Jason Harbes : So keeping the reserve rate relatively stable over next few quarters, I guess, would be the expectation now, okay. And then just question on the core NIM expectation, I guess, the attribute relatively stable in Q4 assuming we got a rate hike in December. What will be the expectation if we didn\u2019t get a rate hike? Clarke Starnes : The rate hike is so late in December. It\u2019s not going to have a big material impact. You\u2019re getting the LIBOR benefit just crossing over year-end. So, I wouldn\u2019t view that as material and we might be off a basis point. But you could be up a basis-point in core margin. So, it\u2019s pretty much a non-issue for fourth quarter. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Terry McEvoy with Stephens. Terry McEvoy : I\u2019ve got just a question for Kelly. Could you just talk about the strategy and optimal size of BB&T in Texas, your energy portfolio stabilized last quarter as is many in the industry we\u2019ve seen a recovery in many of the Texas Bank stocks. So, are you comfortable with the size today and are you looking to grow if M&A is off the table, or is it more of a de novo strategy? Kelly King : The energy portfolio is really, it's just a very small portion of our strategy in Texas. We review the energy portfolio as more of a national kind of a strategy. And I would expect it to continue to grow modestly as the overall industry continues to recover from the lower rates. With regard to Texas, in general, our acquisitions on the city branches, de novo branches, are growing extremely well. The Texas market overall is doing well. We\u2019ll begin to see a little bit of softness in Houston around some multifamily knowledge which you might expect, nothing dramatic. But you\u2019re beginning to see the effect of that a bit nowhere else really across Texas. So we\u2019re gaining momentum substantially. We have about $7 billion or $8 billion operation in Texas which is strong with 14th in market share, up from 53rd in market share when we started in 2009. So, Texas is still growing about 1,000 people a day. So we\u2019ll continue to grow faster than market in Texas. And continue to build out our franchise with de novo types of branch expansions. We will certainly, in the long-term, be in some acquisitions but that\u2019s not a part of our strategy today. And our organic strategy is play very well. We love Texas, and Texas loves us. And so we\u2019re having a lot of fun in Texas. Terry McEvoy : And then just a quick follow-up for Daryl. Will there be a merger and/or restructuring charges in the fourth quarter? And if so, do you know the estimated size? Daryl Bible : I would say our merger related costs have probably been in the $20 million to $30 million. I mean, it\u2019s pretty much phasing down. This might be the last quarter of any substance. We\u2019re getting some little dribbles and drabs in maybe first part of \u201917. But I\u2019d say $20 million to $30 million fourth quarter. Operator : And our next question comes from Christopher Marinac with FIG Partners. Christopher Marinac : I just want to circle back, sorry if you mention this earlier. With the other lending subsidiaries that had some growth this quarter, will that continue to grow? And I was just curious if the losses there are temporary or just the sign of a changing trend? Clarke Starnes : Chris, fourth quarter has probably tends to find seasonality in those particular platforms. And so the retail oriented platforms tend to have higher loss rates in the second half of the year, that define seasonality goes the other way in the first half of the year. You also get the same impact on the growth rates. So I think all-in-all fourth quarter represents more of a seasonal peak than it does a run rate. Christopher Marinac : And, Clarke, will the growth of that line mirror what you mentioned earlier for the overall portfolio relative to GDP plus a few percentage points? Clarke Starnes : No. I think it will be higher. They\u2019re relatively small to the total of the bank. And there is some specialized niches where there is still more penetration opportunity to expand market share. So, I think we would expect those to grow higher than the bank rate. Daryl Bible : At least, double... Clarke Starnes : Yes, probably double. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. Mr. Greer, at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Alan Greer : Okay. Thank you, LeAnn. And thanks to everyone for joining us. If you have further questions today, please don\u2019t hesitate to call Investor Relations team. And this concludes our call. We hope you have a good day. Operator : And that does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

And now, I will turn it over to Kelly. Kelly King : Thanks, Alan. Good morning, everybody and thanks for joining our call. We appreciate your interest in BB&T. So overall, we had a strong 2016 and a solid fourth quarter. Fourth quarter results were driven by good expense control and really very strong credit performance, but also had a couple of key strategic actions that we took during the quarter and the first part of this quarter that will benefit future quarters which we will talk about. We had record annual net income totaling $2.3 billion, which is up 16.7% versus 2015. Fourth quarter net income totaled $592 million, which is up 17.9% versus fourth quarter \u201815 was down slightly from the last quarter. Diluted EPS totaled $0.72, which is up 12.5% versus fourth quarter, down $0.01 from last quarter, but we did have some special items I will cover in just a minute. So, our adjusted EPS totaled $0.73 excluding merger-related and restructuring charges. We had very solid ROA, our common equity and return on tangible of 1.16%, 8.75% and 14.91%, respectively. We had taxable-equivalent revenues totaling $2.8 billion, up 8.3% versus fourth quarter of \u201815 was down slightly from last quarter. Net interest margin did decline 7 basis points to 3.32% from the third quarter, but most of the decline was due to the securities duration adjustments from our old Colonial non-agency portfolio. Remember, that was a large portfolio that was deeply marked and with the steep rate increases in fourth quarter, we had some duration adjustments there and Daryl will give you lot more color about that. So, our core net interest margin was flat for the quarter. Fee income ratio improved to 42.6%, up from 41.9%, so nice steady improvement there as well. GAAP efficiency improved to 71.1% versus 71.7%, but I will say that our adjusted efficiency ratio was up a tick from 58.7% to 59.5% from the third quarter. However, GAAP expenses were 17 point \u2013 I mean, $1.7 billion, that\u2019s a decline of 10% annualized versus third quarter. So while the efficiency ratio moves around some of our actual expense management is very strong. Average loans increased 3%, totaling $142.3 billion and net non-performing assets decreased 3.6%. So, we had very strong credit metrics and Clarke will give you more details on that as we go along. We did refer to 7.5 million shares in the fourth quarter. We had a special ASR repurchase of $200 million in the fourth quarter. So, our total payout ratio was 101.9% for the fourth quarter, which we are very pleased with. We did in the first couple of weeks this quarter restructured $2.9 billion in Federal Home Loan Bank advances. We did record a pre-tax loss of $392 million, which will meaningfully improve our forward run-rate. In fact, we expect our earnings growth to exceed our balance sheet growth for the year, so we expect a meaningful increase in our CCAR 2007 [ph] total AL. Looking at Page 4 just looking at these special items, we did have merger-related and restructuring charges of $13 million pre-tax, which was $0.01 dilution to EPS. We did have the securities duration adjustments I mentioned, did have a material impact because of the long nature of the Colonial securities and because they are very, very heavily marked. Of course, we will get that back over time, but combined with hedge ineffectiveness due to the rate moves, we incurred a $34 million pre-tax cost or approximately $0.03 negative hit to EPS. Post our FHA settlement in last quarter, we completed a further evaluation of our mortgage reserves and released $31 million, which was a $0.02 benefit to EPS. So if you net these items together, you get about a $0.02 negative impact to EPS out of these various items. If you look at Page 5 with regard to loans, we had some loan growth. We had 3% loan growth. Now, we did have a couple of portfolio purchases of prime auto. I would point out that we do that periodically. We view it as kind of a normal part of our business not unlike corresponding mortgage purchases, but we only buy when the seller needs to sell, meaning when the economics are really good for us. So, those were two acquisitions that were very attractive for us. In addition, we had strong growth in several of our specialized areas. Grandbridge was up 28.4% annualized, equipment finance, up 15.2% annualized, and Regional Acceptance was up was 10.5% annualized, so a solid growth given our risk appetite, which we feel pleased about. Now looking ahead to the first quarter, we expect loans to be flat to slightly up. Remember, that the first quarter for us is seasonally challenged. So first quarter last year, we were actually down 1.3. So that\u2019s a bit more optimistic, but it may not sound very bullish, but I will tell you that we actually are very optimistic about the economy going forward. It will take a little while for it to get going, but look we are going to have lower taxes, less regulation. It\u2019s really a big deal. Optimism is up. I have been talking a lot to clients and to our RPs, regional presidents in the last several weeks, including yesterday, and clearly, CEOs optimistic. They are making plans to invest and we really think this is going to kick into a meaningful improvement in investment and job growth as we head into the second and third and fourth quarter. Our expectation is that real GDP can move to the 3% to 4% range, which will be supporting most federal loan growth as it begins to unfold. So while loan growth is not stellar at this point, we believe it will be growing consistently as we go through the year and we are very, very excited about that. Looking at Slide 6, we continue to improve our deposit mix and interest rate bearing deposit costs went down 1 basis point to 22 basis points. Non-interest bearing deposits or DDA went up 6.8%, which is very strong trend. Our percentage of non-interest bearing deposits to total deposits improved to 32.1, up from 31.7. So really, nice movement in our deposit mix and cost, which has been the continuing trend for a couple of years. Let me turn it over to Daryl now for some additional perspectives. Daryl Bible : Thank you, Kelly and good morning everyone. Today I am going to talk about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, non-interest expense, capital and our segment results. Turning to Slide 7, overall, we had a good quarter with regard to credit quality. Net charge-offs totaled $151 million, up 5 basis points from last quarter. That includes $15 million related to PCI loans and $14 million related to loan sales. When you exclude these items, core charge-offs were $122 million, down 6% from last quarter. Loans 90 days or more past due increased 7.4%, primarily due to an increase in residential mortgage. Loans 30 days to 89 days past due increased 10% due to seasonality in our consumer related portfolios. NPAs were down 3.6% from last quarter. Looking at the first quarter, we expect net charge-offs to be in the range of 35 basis points to 45 basis points, assuming no unexpected deterioration in the economy as we expect the NPAs to remain in a similar range to this quarter. Continuing on Slide 8, our energy portfolio totaled $1.2 billion, less than 1% of our total loans. Outstanding balances, total commitments and non-accruals were all down from last quarter. Our quality mix continues to be very good with less than 10% in oilfield services. With higher oil and gas prices, conditions are trending positively in this industry. Turning to Slide 9, our allowance coverage ratios remain strong at 2.47x for charge-offs and 2x for NPLs. The allowance to loan ratio was 1.04%, relatively flat compared to last quarter. Excluding acquired portfolios, the allowance to loan\u2019s ratio was 1.13%, slightly down from last quarter and our effective allowance coverage remains strong. We recorded a provision of $129 million. Adjusting for PCI loans, the provision was $133 million compared to core net charge-offs of $122 million, which I mentioned earlier. This shows a reserve build of $11 million. Looking forward, our provision is expected to match charge-offs plus loan growth. Turning to Slide 10, compared to last quarter, net interest margin was 3.32%, down 7 basis points. Core margin was 3.18%, flat versus last quarter. The decrease resulted mostly from security duration adjustments from deeply discounted acquired assets and the decline in purchase accounting accretion. Earlier this month, we restructured $2.9 billion of federal home loan bank advances. This balance sheet action places BB&T in a unique position, where earnings growth will exceed balance sheet growth. Given the expected growth in capital, we plan to significantly increase CCAR \u201817 payout, which will support faster EPS growth. This does not include any potential corporate tax policy changes. Looking into the first quarter, we expect core margin to increase 8 basis points to 10 basis points due to the impact of the federal home loan bank restructure, last month\u2019s rate increase and favorable asset mix and funding cost and mix changes. We expect GAAP margin to increase 10 to 12 basis points. This is due to items mentioned earlier plus the expected absence of duration adjustments offset by the reduction in benefits from purchase accounting and PCI. Asset sensitivity decreased mostly due to the Federal Home Loan Bank restructuring and slower mortgage prepayments due to higher rates. Continuing on Slide 11, our fee income ratio improved to 42.6%. Some of the changes in the increase of $9 million in insurance income was mostly driven by seasonally higher commissions, mortgage banking is down $47 million due to net MSR valuation adjustments and lower production and spreads. And other income increased $19 million due to higher income from partnerships and other investments offset by $10 million in hedge ineffectiveness. Non-interest income totaled $1.2 billion essentially flat compared to last quarter. Looking ahead to the first quarter, we expect fee income to be relatively flat. We expect seasonally stronger insurance fee offset by seasonal declines in service charges and lower investment banking and mortgage banking income. Turning to Slide 12, non-interest expenses totaled $1.7 billion, down 10% from last quarter. Personnel expense was essentially flat driven by $12 million decline in equity-based compensation offset by incentive payments. Loan-related expense declined as a result of a $31 million adjustment to the mortgage repurchase reserves. Other expense was up $39 million mostly due to the net benefit of $73 million last quarter related to the FHA settlement. Merger-related and restructuring charges decreased $30 million as National Penn integration winds down. Going forward, excluding merger-related and restructuring charges and the Federal Home Loan Bank restructuring charge, expenses should be slightly below $1.3 billion even with seasonal headwinds that typically occur in personnel costs. Turning to Slide 13, capital ratios remain strong with a fully phased-in common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10%. Our LCR was 121% and our liquid asset buffer was very strong at 12.6%. The dividend payout was 41% with a total payout, including the ASR of 101.9%. Going forward, we continue our share repurchase program with up to $160 million in the first quarter. As I mentioned before, we are currently targeting a significant increase in total payout for CCAR \u201817. Now, let\u2019s look at segments beginning on Slide 14, the Community Bank net income totaled $334 million, down slightly from last quarter. Non-interest expense decreased $8 million driven by lower personnel expense and merger-related and restructuring charges. Our commercial production in the fourth quarter was the highest level seen since 2011. Turning to Slide 15, residential mortgage banking net income was $64 million, down from last quarter. This was driven by lower net MSR valuations and lower volumes and margins. Production mix was 47% purchase and 53% refi. Gain on sale margins were 0.86, down from 1.06 last quarter driven by lower correspondent levels. Looking to Slide 16, dealer financial services income totaled $41 million, relatively flat compared to last quarter. Net interest income was up $13 million partially due to the purchase of the prime auto portfolio in November. The provision for credit losses increased $10 million mostly driven by loan growth as well as seasonally higher net charge-offs in Regional Acceptance portfolio. Net charge-offs for the prime portfolio remain excellent at 21 basis points. Turning to Slide 17, specialized lending net income totaled $55 million, down $9 million from last quarter. We had strong seasonal growth and production growth in premium finance, equipment finance and Grandbridge. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily driven by asset write-downs in equipment finance. Looking at Slide 18, insurance services net income totaled $34 million, up $11 million from last quarter. Non-interest expense totaled $374 million relatively flat linked quarter, the higher non-interest income from last quarter were primarily from seasonality in commercial property and casualty insurance. Turning to Slide 19, the Financial Services segment had $122 million in net income. The increase was mostly due to higher investment banking and client derivative income, higher income from SBIC, private equity investment and a decline in provision. Corporate Banking\u2019s modest decline in loan growth was driven by higher than usual pay-downs and the sale of some energy loans. Wealth generated strong loan and deposit growth, 8% and 31%, respectively, compared to last quarter. Finally, the provision was down $34 million, driven by the sale of energy loans. In summary, we had solid earnings performance, strong credit quality, stable core net interest margin and good expense control for the quarter. Looking forward, we expect continued strong credit quality, meaningfully stronger net interest margin, solid expense control and a significant increase in total payout to our shareholders. Now, let me turn it back over to Kelly for closing remarks and Q&A. Kelly King : Thanks Daryl. So just a couple of strategic summary points, as I said, I think it was a solid quarter, good expense control, strong credit performance. These strategic actions will do setup a meaningful better margin and potential higher CCAR payout for the next year. I would point out that all of our key strategies are working very, very well. Our Corporate Banking strategy is working well. We think we can even ramp it to a higher level as we go through this year. Our wealth strategy likewise is doing great and positioned for even an enhanced investment specialized lending continues to provide good diversification and is growing in appropriate rate. Insurance, while not performing at a high level as it will in the future because soft insurance rates will continue to build what I consider to be kind of an annuitized insurance revenue stream in that business as it gets more and more effective every year and we\u2019re making increased investments in our digital operations, which will cause substantial improvement quality relationships with our clients and improve profitability going forward. So projected with the better economy, especially in Main Street, we are really excited about what can happen in our Community Bank. Keep in mind that our Community Bank is almost totally focused on Main Street. Main Street has been really struggling for the last 8 years. We believe what\u2019s getting ready to happen is a substantial resurgence of Main Street. These folks, as we reported to you, have been holding back on investments in equipment, our computers, trucks and our cars, etcetera. We are getting really, really good feedback from our client contact people that this is really changing. In fact, I saw a survey yesterday on small business optimism says it\u2019s at a 12-year high. So overall, I will just tell you that things look pretty good, lower taxes, less regulation, higher interest rates and faster GDP growth, overall a really good proposition for the banking industry. It\u2019s a new day and we are very excited about it. I will turn it over to Alan. Alan Greer : Okay. Thank you, Kelly. Ashley, if you will come back on the line at this time and explain how our listeners may participate in the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. John Pancari : Wanted to ask\u2026 Kelly King : John\u2026 John Pancari : Yes. Can you hear me, okay? Kelly King : Yes. Go ahead. John Pancari : Okay. I just wanted to ask around the CCAR commentary around the significant increase, wanted to just get an idea of can you help us with how to think about the magnitude given where you see earnings going and could you be nearing the 100% combined payout. And then separately the mix, if you can just talk about how you would prioritize the dividend versus buyback? Thanks. Kelly King : We really think with the \u2013 as I indicated anticipated faster earnings growth and less fast growth in the balance sheet it sets us up for that opportunity. We try to be conservative. Having said that, we would expect and we have not made our CCAR final decision and the Board has not approved it, but management would expect that the total payout for next year would be in the 100% range, which will be materially higher than we have been. We would expect to see a modest increase on our dividend. Remember, our dividend was already very high, one of the highest, if not the highest dividend yields. And so that will set up then a pretty large bucket of capital opportunities for us, which will be used as we have in the past, certainly the possibility of acquisitions. There is some possibility of a special cash dividend although I don\u2019t put that high on the list and certainly that would imply substantial increase in buybacks. John Pancari : Okay, got it. And then separately, my follow-up is going to be on the expenses, have you \u2013 if you could talk a little bit about your reg and compliance spending around, particularly around the BSA consent order. How much would you say in terms of related expense is in the run-rate currently versus still to come? Thanks. Kelly King : Yes. So, the BSA issue for us is an important issue, but not a substantially important issue. We have been working on this for about a year. We have already built in most of the run-rate expense increase related to that. So it would not be a material increase in terms of additional expenses. We are way down the road in terms of resolving the issues that we needed to improve on. So it\u2019s important, we need to fix it, but we substantially already done it, to be honest. And so we have got some remaining execution work to be done. There is not going to be a material issue in terms of our expense run-rate going forward. John Pancari : And given that, how quickly do you expect the potential resolution since your way down the road? Kelly King : Yes. These things have a life of their own. In many cases, it\u2019s taken companies 1.5 years, 2 years to get out. No way, I can guarantee anything, but I would expect that because of how far down the road we are that we will get out much quicker from this point going forward than you have come to expect with other institutions. John Pancari : Okay, got it. Thanks, Kelly. Operator : And we will take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with Royal Bank of Canada. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning, guys. Kelly King : Good morning. Gerard Cassidy : Kelly, you talked about the outlook for being better this year on the economy and stuff. Are there any parts of the franchise where you are seeing better growth opportunities, whether it\u2019s in Florida or Texas? And on that, would you guys consider growing the oil and energy portfolio later this year if the oil prices stabilize at these levels? Kelly King : So Gerard, it\u2019s actually very broad-based. In fact, I did a survey, because I was going to the Goldman Conference back here a few weeks ago and I did a survey from all of our 26 Presidents across our entire 15 states and asked them to talk to a few of their clients to see what they were thinking, because I like to write real-time feedback and their feedback was absolutely consistent across the board that everybody was optimistic. They were making plans to invest. And it\u2019s exactly what we thought, new drugs, new computers, some expansions. I met with some regional Presidents in person yesterday and got a real current update and the message was very, very consistent. They gave me a number of anecdotes in terms of individual companies that were already requesting loans to buy trucks to expand their plan to expand their inventory, etcetera. So it is, in fact, happening. It\u2019s across the footprint. It is what I would call Main Street America, which was exactly where we play the best. With regard to oil and energy, yes, we would expect to expand that. We think we said all along it\u2019s a really good long-term business. The last year or so has been a bit of an overreaction in my humble opinion with regards to the quality of that. We haven\u2019t changed our posture during the whole period. We remained optimistic and bullish and are looking for ways to expand. Chris Henson : Gerard, this is Chris. I would add specifically areas if you are looking for the Triangle and Charlotte and Triad regions in North Carolina, D.C. and Houston are all areas that have really sort of building momentum in pipelines and three of those have been top of our production leaders in 2016 as well. Gerard Cassidy : Great. And then Daryl, you talked about capital liquidity in your prepared remarks, on the LCR at 121%, is that the fully phased-in number that you expect to have by the \u2013 when the rules go 100%? I think it\u2019s in 2019. Daryl Bible : Yes. I would say we will operate in the 120 range. We might get into the teens, fluctuate, but we want to keep a little bit of a cushion. That number tends to move around a fair amount on a day-to-day basis. So, you just want to keep it elevated. So I wouldn\u2019t want to get it to close to the threshold, but keeping a little cushion. It\u2019s really not hurting us where it is. I think we can manage it at that \u2013 at those levels. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from John McDonald with Bernstein. John McDonald : Good morning. Daryl, I want to ask about net interest income and some of your thoughts around the dynamics there, the securities portfolio, you had some runoff this quarter as you indicated you would as you get some cash on the table, just wondering what your thoughts are there as rates have gone up, will you be investing and will we see the securities portfolio start to grow and how that might affect your net interest income dollars outlook? Daryl Bible : Yes. So right now John, we did not reinvest the cash flows in the fourth quarter. We did repurchase our normal cash flows for this quarter. So securities are going to stay around $44 billion size. So that\u2019s kind of our level that we are staying at. It is true that levels are higher now and I would say what we are investing in now, which are basically treasuries, 5 years and some 15-year pass-throughs, those are coming on yields that basically are not hurting our yields anymore. So there shouldn\u2019t be any material run down in the investment if the curve stays where it is or it could even get better at some point. As far as at point where we would try to add back to it, I think we are far from that point. If you listen to Chairman, Yellen\u2019s speech yesterday, she is clearly in the camp that she thinks short-term rates should get up close to 3%. Whether that gets fair enough, we will see, but it\u2019s definitely going higher. We will see what happens to the longer end of the curve. Our liquidity is strong. So there is really no need to add to the investment portfolio. And with Kelly and Chris and Clarke, I mean they feel really confident that our loan growth is going to really start to come online middle part of the year and thereafter. So we feel that we are going to have pretty good balance sheet growth and good NII growth. The restructuring that we did basically ensures us that we are going to have positive NII growth year-over-year. It\u2019s going to probably show that we are going to have revenue growth. And if we continue to have our expenses stay where they are, you should see the efficiency ratio start to fall. John McDonald : Okay. And just on the NII and NIM front, could you remind us how much benefit do you expect to get from the Fed hike that occurred in December and what kind of deposit beta are you assuming that you will see this year versus last and how does that compare to what\u2019s modeled in your disclosures? Daryl Bible : Yes. So I would say if you look at the increase we had in December of \u201815, the beta was almost non-existent, less than 5%. To-date, we are only a month out now. Our beta is between 5% and 10%, mainly in the commercial accounts. So here again, really outperforming what we had in our models. We have in our models close to 60% beta assumptions. So I would say that the increase that we had this past quarter probably give us 3-plus percent net interest margin benefit just from that alone. So that\u2019s one of the reasons why we are helping to guide for much higher core net interest margin. John McDonald : So that\u2019s about 3 basis points, Daryl, for a 25 hike? Daryl Bible : Yes, for what we had this past December and the beta is less than 10% right now. John McDonald : Got it. Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Kelly King : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : Hey, couple of questions, one is on the capital ratios, so bringing up the payout ratio plus loan growth, just wondering what type of CET1 you are willing to traject to, like how low will it go? Daryl Bible : Yes. So Betsy, I mean you can see with the ASRs that we did last quarter, we still build capital ratios. And we expect to have \u2013 there was a fair amount of compensation related benefit coming through on the equity provision. So I would say that our CET1 should still stay 10% or higher. I mean we don\u2019t see it going down more than a touch right now. So I mean if you look at our number now, we are I think 10.2, fully phased in at 10. So you might see it go down a tick, but I think we feel comfortable that we can significantly increase that and still maintain a 10% CET1. Betsy Graseck : But over time, like do you feel even a 10% you are overcapitalized, that there is economically room to bring that down? Kelly King : Betsy, we are going to remain somewhat conservative on that until we see how things play out in Washington. Independent of the changes that are being talked about, with regard to the handling, etcetera, etcetera, there is an opportunity to bring that 10% down. On the other hand, there is a reasonable prospect that some variation is going to pass, which is what we call is upward pressure on capital requirements and so we don\u2019t want to be in a position to where we get forced in to having to going to market by expenses of capital. So we are going to remain a little conservative. That will hurt EPS a little bit in short run, but it\u2019s a smart run. It\u2019s the best move for the shareholders. So we will stay path, see how things play out. If all that fizzles out then there is an opportunity to your point to move down a little bit. On the other hand, if it comes through, we may be having to accumulate capital. Betsy Graseck : Got it, okay. And then just a follow-up on the total return is obviously to the buyback, but then there is also the optionality for M&A. And maybe you could speak to where you think you are in that. I know there was the AML BSA out there that was holding back from M&A, but just wondering how investors should think about your comments. Is it a placeholder for buyback or are you really think look, we are not in the M&A camp over the next year or so it is a buyback? Kelly King : It\u2019s the placeholder with reservation. Independent of the BSA issue, we are not ready to get back into bank M&A yet. We are still finalizing Susquehanna and Nat Penn. We hadn\u2019t closed, but we are still finishing up some of these big projects. And to be honest, Betsy, we are doing \u2013 and I am doing a lot of thinking just in terms of the proper value of buying institutions that have a lot of branches. I mean, there is a chance that we are facing a near-term tipping point with regard to the value of branches as the digital technologies really accelerate and reduce the interactions in the branches. It\u2019s not to say that we would have no interest, but it changes economics. And so I am not quite sure today the sellers in any event would be ready to recognize the realities of the changing economics. And so number one, we are not ready to get back into game independent of BSA. Number two, we are being thoughtful during this call is about the real valuations of acquisitions when the time comes. And number three, we don\u2019t think this BSA things will take all that long to get out to them. And by the way, we are not inherently precluded from acquisitions during the BSA period certainly with regard to insurance and other types of acquisitions and so \u2013 but we just don\u2019t consider that to be a binding constraint right now, because the binding constraint is our own. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay, thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from Jennifer Demba with SunTrust. Jennifer Demba : Betsy just covered my question. Let me ask a little more on M&A and your thought \u2013 your commentary on buying company with a lot of branches. I mean, that\u2019s a pretty big statement, Kelly. Is this something you have been thinking about for a while? And I mean, when you think you are ready to buy again, what kind of institution are you looking for ideally? Is it something more larger MOE or how small will you go? Kelly King : So yes, I have been thinking about it for a while. And it\u2019s a difficult thing to get your hands around. I mean, on the one hand, it\u2019s clearly a steady decline in branch activity. On the other hand, that is not to suggest the branches are not really, really important from the small business clients still going to branch about once a day, because they got a lot of cash. Wealthy clients go fairly often and even the millenials who don\u2019t go very often really value the branches. So, we are just in a period right now where it\u2019s inconclusive in terms of the future value of branches, but it\u2019s probable that branches will be somewhat less attractive going forward than they are today. All that means is you are still interested. I am still interested, but it means it has an economic impact in terms of the evaluations. And so we will have to be thoughtful about that as we go forward. Now, there is a difference in terms of M&A in market and out of market. So, the most difficult, frankly, today would be to acquire a large branch distribution operation out of market, because there is no \u2013 there are no cost synergies in terms of overlaps and so you have to get all of your cost improvement out of the backroom. On the other hand, if you do an in market deal, you get the pretty easily achievable backroom savings, which are very predictable. And then you may get some \u2013 I mean you get a backroom and you get substantial overlap of branches. So in markets would still make a lot more attractive proposition today economically than out of market, not saying out of market can\u2019t work, but it means valuation has to take that into consideration. As to size, we have always said that we are interested in larger deals than smaller deals, particularly in the last several years just because it takes about as much time to do a smaller deal as it does a large deal, but I am not ready to put any a lot of concreteness around the size and all of that, because as I have said we are not in the market right now. So when we get back into the market, we will give you more definitiveness with regard to what we are exactly looking for. Jennifer Demba : What are your plans for the BB&T branch network this year, any rationalization plans at this point? Kelly King : Yes, we would \u2013 we will continue \u2013 we have got a long-term continue trend of what I just call natural pruning, that is to say, you have an old branch that needs to be replaced. Typically, that looks like you have two that are 2 miles apart. They are both old. You get rid of two and go to one. That\u2019s natural pruning. And in some cases, the market just dies and you just close out completely. But we are and we started this in last year, we are being more aggressive in terms of not what I call more than pruning or non-pruning that is to say, we are being more aggressive in terms of some branch closes where they are actually profitable, but by combining two profitable ones into a new one, two plus two becomes five, because we are finding that because the branch traffic is less consistent, you can actually close more today than you could close 5 years ago because people use more mobile banking NIU platform, etcetera. So we would expect to be more aggressive this year and coming years in terms of closings, but we are not going to do a radical blind close 20% of branches or anything like that in this scenario. Chris, do you want to make any more comments with regard to that? Chris Henson : Yes. I will just say transactions are down about 4%. We closed about 2% of our branches this year and I would say somewhere in the neighborhood of half of that number would have been what Kelly just spoke to, would have been what I will call these sort of transformational type of approach. And we are going to be looking for more of those. I think the opportunity exist to rationalize the structure over time, where you have opportunity to capture most of the client base, but still have them run on your digital array also. I think he is exactly right. Jennifer Demba : Thank you for the color. Operator : And our next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Kelly King : Good morning. Matt O\u2019Connor: You guys gave some good NIM details for the first quarter, but I guess I was hoping to just peel back a little bit more as we think about some of the moving pieces and adapt NIM outlook of 10 basis points to 12 basis points, maybe just kind of filling the blanks like you have got, obviously the kind of step up or absence of the one-time amortization drag that was 5 bps this quarter, I assume you get most of that back, the rate hike you mentioned was 43 before, what\u2019s the benefit of the debt prepayment and then kind of all other factors, what\u2019s going on there? Daryl Bible : So I think you got the pieces. Maybe you just go back, reconcile to the 10 to 12 GAAP improvement, we get 5 basis points for the home loan bank restructuring. We get 5 basis points back from the duration adjustments. Every quarter, we will probably have a couple of basis points, call it 2 basis points. We will have runoff of purchase accounting going against that. And then [Technical Difficulty] 3 plus right now for the rate increase. So I think we feel very good. Our margin will be in probably mid 3.40s. And finding out how rates go and if they continue to go up some this year, we feel comfortable that those levels can be maintained in that area. So it all depends on how much rates go up and what the betas are. And to be honest with you, we think if rates continue to go up, betas won\u2019t stay as well as they are they eventually will have to start to increase. That said, we still feel pretty comfortable that margins should stay in the 3.40s. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. So as a follow-up, the mid-3 40s if rates continue to move up and then if rates stay stable, is the core NIM stable and then you just bleed down whatever purchase accounting one-off would be? Daryl Bible : I think so. I think we are at a point now where assets are coming on and our mix changes and with what\u2019s going on, I think we have a pretty good core stable margin right now and with a little rate increases we might have improving core margins. So, I think that\u2019s all positive for us right now, Matt. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : And we will take our next question from Michael Rose with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Michael Rose : Hey, good morning guys. How are you? Kelly King : Good morning. Daryl Bible : Good morning. Michael Rose : Just wanted to ask about insurance, if I back out Swett & Crawford, it looks like it might have been a little weaker year-on-year. Can you give some color there and maybe what the outlook is as we move into \u201817? Thanks. Kelly King : Sure, happy to. You are exactly right. I mean, our growth year-over-year or fourth over fourth would have been about, I think 10 and some change percent. If you pull out all acquisitions, our core organic growth would have been up 0.6% year-over-year, but that\u2019s in a very soft insurance market, where there is just tremendous excess capital. And it is causing rates to be down in the neighborhood of 2% to 4%. We are heavy in more commercial property. So that ends with a company we have called [indiscernible] subject to cap property rates and they are down probably in the 10% to 12% range. So we would be certainly on the high end of the reduction, so probably in the 4% range down. Our new business, on the other hand, new business in retail is up in the 3% range. So taking those together, that\u2019s what\u2019s enabling us to remain positive. So, we are still moving market share. It\u2019s just you have that downward pressure on rates due to capital. The other thing that occurred this year, we had some weather challenges, but it was not enough to cause rates to go up, but it was enough to cause the performance payments back to the brokers to decline. So, we actually have had a decline in contingent payments of about 12.5% year-over-year as well. So even with the reduction in contingent payments and a soft pricing, we were still able to rise above that and have positive organic growth. So I feel really good about the year overall in the neighborhood of 20% EBITDA margin. So I think looking forward what we have planned even with \u2013 we see rates as having stabilized. We don\u2019t see them maybe jumping back up. We have been in this now for about 18 months. The normal soft market duration last about 3 years. So, we don\u2019t see them getting worse. I think through some things we have going on internally, we think give us some organic opportunity. We are actually planning to be up 3% to 4% this year. So, we feel pretty good bullish about the business. Michael Rose : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe switching gears for Daryl can you kind of talk about what the net impact would be if there is any sort of change to the corporate tax rate and what the earn-back would be on the DTA write-down? Thanks. Daryl Bible : So Matt, if rates, tax rates change, so right now, our corporate rate is 35%. In essence, we get almost 90% of it for our given tax rate change. So, if tax rates fall from 35% to 15%, we would get close to 18% lower taxes on it. The reason we don\u2019t get all of it is really driven by how our state taxes impact a change in the corporate tax rate, but we get the vast majority of it. So, it\u2019s close to 90% would basically flow through the bottom line. Now, our tax strategies are pretty simple. We really have just tax exempt loans and securities. We have BOLI and we have basically a low income tax credit. The assumption there is none of those are impacted. If any of those get impacted, then what I told you needs to get adjusted, but assuming just corporate tax rates fall, we will get about 90% of it to the bottom line. Michael Rose : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks for taking my questions. Kelly King : Yes, thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Kelly, you mentioned we are in a new world and you talked a lot about the potential upside on the revenue side. I am wondering if I could just dig deeper into John Pancari\u2019s earlier question and get your thoughts on where you think overall regulatory costs can trend. I guess it\u2019s a two part question, one is from a natural rate standpoint, how do you think regulatory costs are set to trend for BB&T over the next 1 year or 2 years, if you get some regulatory relief, what the opportunity could be in terms of potentially reallocating those costs? Kelly King : Well, that\u2019s a great question and it\u2019s one that we are all trying to figure out the answer to right now, but I will give you my thoughts. So if you take time a steady course assuming there are no substantial rollbacks, then I think you would think in terms of our regulatory costs over the next year are sort of being kind of flattish. I mean we have already built down a huge amount of ramped up revenue or regulatory costs over the last 2 years or 3 years. Some of that relates to huge costs that we have had to put into some of these projects that are substantially driven by regulatory requirements and ramp up that we have already put in BSA regulatory compliance, etcetera. So independent of any substantial changes, I would call it kind of flattish. Now, if you have substantial regulatory changes, which I do believe we will have, then there is clearly the opportunity for reduction in regulatory cost. It\u2019s hard to get your hands on, to be honest, because it depends on how much. I would say that if you get the maximum amount of regulatory changes, it\u2019s not going to be as much reduction in regulatory costs as a lot of people think. Maybe an outlier on this, but a lot of people are thinking kind of euphorically that they will do all this stuff they are talking about and regulatory costs going to zero. That will not happen. Number one, they are not going to get everything done that they want to get done although they will get a lot done. And even if they get a lot of these changes done, their baseline regulatory requirements are not going to go away and probably shouldn\u2019t go away. We need basics good, solid regulations. So trying to give you a number of top of my head, I would say over a couple of year period of time, if you had the maximum amount of regulatory pullback, you could see a 20% kind of reduction in regulatory costs, maybe 25% but not 50% or 75%. It\u2019s meaningful, but it\u2019s not dramatic. The bigger changes, of course for banking is tax reductions and increased margins and increased growth rates in GDP. The regulatory cost reduction is icing on the cake and it will be material, but I think you cannot quantify is that if we get what I hope to get, which is in addition to a number of specific regulatory changes, if you also get a substantial change in the tone or the intensity of regulation, then that is a big deal because it\u2019s not just the regulations. It\u2019s the degree of potentially with which the regulators apply those regulations and so what happens is it\u2019s not just absolute direct cost that goes into regulations, it\u2019s the indirect costs of all of the management time that is on executing on all these regulatory changes and so it\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s pretty big, I can qualify it for you. But if all of a sudden, we had a less intense environment we could get back to the where it was 10 years ago in terms of basic focus on good, solid regulations and we could free up a substantial amount of our people\u2019s time with regard to focusing not on that, but focusing on client relationship management, business development, it would be huge. I can\u2019t give you a number, but it would be huge. Erika Najarian : So Kelly, just to follow-up, it sounds like what you are saying is a potential inflection point in supervisory leadership could be meaningful to your earnings power even before we start talking about Dodd-Frank repeal, did I interpret that correctly? Kelly King : You got it exactly right. Erika Najarian : Okay, thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Matt Burnell : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First of all, Kelly, you mentioned a couple of acquisitions late in September and in the fourth quarter and you also suggested relatively muted first quarter growth, which is \u2013 which seems seasonally appropriate, but growth improving over the course of the year as GDP improves, how are you thinking about future acquisitions if you are in terms of your full year 2017 thinking about loan growth? Kelly King : I am not factoring acquisitions into our \u201817 loan growth expectations. I am not sure what you were talking about in terms of fourth quarter. I don\u2019t recall mentioning any acquisition. Matt Burnell : Are you talking about portfolio purchases? Kelly King : Portfolio purchases. Matt Burnell : Got it. I am sorry. Kelly King : Yes. We are not really building that materially into our \u201817 \u2013 it could happen, but it\u2019s not a part of our \u2013 it\u2019s kind of part of our normal considerations there, but it\u2019s not something that I spent a lot of time on. So we are not factoring much, it might be a little bit but not much on that. So we are really trying to signal that our loan growth is going to be core loan growth. It\u2019s going to be relatively soft for the first quarter. And then while we are not prepared to give numbers, it will be building, we think in regard through second through the fourth quarter. Matt Burnell : And then if I could just follow-up on that, it sounds like you are thinking about the future payout ratio rising to the 100% range, I am presuming that that\u2019s incorporating your much \u2013 your visibly stronger expectation for loan growth in the latter half of 2017 as it sounds like you expect GDP growth to ramp from roughly 2-plus percent real GDP growth ramp from 2-plus percent to 3% or perhaps even better? Kelly King : Yes. I think GDP will ramp from the 2% kind of range to 3% to 4%. I don\u2019t think it will get to 3% to 4% for this full year. It may be getting to 3% to 4% by the end of the year on a run rate, but if you get to \u201818, I think you have got very good chance of a 3% to 4% kind of run rate for the entire year. So it will be a building year in terms of GDP, it will be a building year in terms of loan growth and so the whole year of \u201817 won\u2019t be as strong as the whole year of \u201818 will be. Matt Burnell : And Daryl if I can just one very quick clarification, you mentioned you expect expenses in the first quarter to be below $1.3 billion, in the slide, you have $1.7 billion? Daryl Bible : Sorry, it\u2019s $1.7 billion. Matt Burnell : Okay. Thank you very much. Daryl Bible : And that\u2019s including the seasonality that we have. Matt Burnell : Right. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Amanda Larsen : Hi guys. This is Amanda Larsen on for Ken. How big is the capital hit you are expecting on the FHLB retirement in 1Q? And then how are you thinking about the size of your overall long-term debt footprint in \u201817? Are there remaining $1 billion of FHLB still on the table? Daryl Bible : So we do have more home loans on the table, but they aren\u2019t really marked at market. So we can unwind those without any gain or loss, without any impact. So they will basically price the market, so that will just be that. By the way, we want to maintain that funding or go somewhere else from a funding perspective. As far as the hit to capital, it\u2019s about $250 million. You just take the 3.92 and just tax effect it. We typically get a fair amount of equity credit from our comp plans in the first quarter. Coupled with continued exercises from the higher stock valuation, that\u2019s a huge offset to our capital ratios that we have there. So I would say capital ratios still be pretty strong at the end of the first quarter even with this restructuring number that we have and doing that buyback that we are going to normally do in the 1.60. Kelly King : And I would just point out this is just really good effective utilization of capital during the period of time where we are building excess capital. Daryl Bible : Absolutely. Amanda Larsen : Okay. And then thinking about average earning assets in 1Q given all the moving parts? Daryl Bible : Average earning assets should be up just a touch depending on loan growth or securities will be relatively flat as we reinvest those cash flows, but NII growth will happen because our margin guidance is coming up significantly, so I think you will see pretty robust growth in NII. Amanda Larsen : Okay. And just one last little one, can you quantify the PE gain in other? Daryl Bible : Private equity was $15 million if I recall that we had in other assets. There is a lot in that category, but I think this $14 million to $15 million is what we had in that. But we typically have a decent end of the year number every fourth quarter in private equity. Amanda Larsen : Okay, got it. Thank you. Daryl Bible : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And we will take your next question from Saul Martinez with UBS. Saul Martinez : Hi, good morning. Want to continue on the M&A theme, Kelly you have mentioned in the past that you think the optimal size of a bank may be somewhere in the neighborhood, I believe if I recall correctly in the $400 billion plus range. You have also mentioned hey, this is a new day. The economic backdrop has improved. We don\u2019t \u2013 still don\u2019t know how exactly the regulatory environment will play out, but obviously, there is the potential for at least a lighter regulatory touch. Just curious how your thinking has evolved, if at all, on this question of what the right size or what the optimal size of a bank is? Kelly King : So, I think as we reflect on the various changes, the optimum size might actually be \u2013 could actually be somewhat lower, because what we are seeing out of all this is the premium organic growth has risen while the premium on acquisition growth maybe has gone down some. And so we still believe long-term it would be advantageous to our shareholders to be larger, but to be very honest, we can get to this still we need to be through the organic growth only. And again unless you get acquisitions at a very attractive price, organic growth is going to be much more attractive. Keep in mind over the last 8 years, you couldn\u2019t count on as much organic growth, because the state of the economy and the state of regulation and all of what\u2019s going on. Looking forward, we think in this new day environment, there is much more opportunity for organic growth, which puts less pressure on acquisition growth, but I want to restate again to be very clear we are not in acquisition business now. So, we are totally focused on organic growth. And we believe we can get to the size and scale we need to be strictly through organic growth without any necessary requirements on acquisitions as that becomes appropriate from an economic perspective at some point in the future, we will take a look at it. Saul Martinez : Okay, that\u2019s clear. Thanks for that. Daryl, if I can ask a question on NIR and maybe we could just talk about it a little bit more systematically maybe what the outlook is for some of the key line items obviously. You have talked a little bit about insurance as mortgage maybe have some headwinds, some of the other lines are doing well, but what are \u2013 how should we be thinking about some of the major drivers of the major line items for NIR in \u201817? Daryl Bible : So if you look at our fee income ratio, Chris commented on insurance, so that should be up modestly on a year-over-year basis. Service charges, we continue to make investments and service charges growing accounts, so that should continue to trend up. As far as mortgage banking, we continue to build out new markets. The MBA forecast has been down around 15% give or take, but we are hoping to be more flattish there just by building out our new markets that we have. And then we continue to make investments in investment banking and brokerage. We did have that one restructuring this past year there, but that said they have a lot of momentum. They are doing really well. So I think all that\u2019s going well. So I\u2019d say overall, fee income, up probably mid single-digit on a year-over-year basis. Chris Henson : Paul, this is Chris. I would add investment banking is probably core growth at 6% or 8% when you strip out that restructuring and in that would be capital markets as well as the retail broker and we are adding offices in the retail brokerage to complement it well throughout the footprint. And wealth, for example, even had a 22% revenue growth rate this year. So, it continues to operate really, really well. Saul Martinez : Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks a lot. Kelly King : Thank you. Operator : And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn conference back over to Alan Greer for any additional or closing remarks. Alan Greer : Okay. Thank you everyone for joining our call. Apologize that we ran out of time, had a few folks still in the queue. Feel free to call Investor Relations, I would be happy to take your questions. Thank you and we hope you have a good day. Operator : And that concludes today\u2019s presentation. We thank you all for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

And now, I will turn it over to Kelly. Kelly King : Thanks, Alan. Good morning, everybody. Thank you very much for joining our call. As always I really appreciate your interest in our company. So it's a very good start to 2017. We had record quarterly revenues, good expense control and strong returns. Our net income available to common shareholders was 348 million, down 28%, but remember that included several major items I'll discuss in just a moment. So adjusted net income was 611 million which is up by significant 15.1% versus first quarter of '16. Adjusted EPS totaled $0.74, up 10.4% versus the first quarter of '16 and our returns were really good. Our adjusted ROA was 1.21%, adjusted return on common equity was 9.18% and return on tangible common equity was 15.56% and our risk related adjusted assets return was 1.5%, very, very good returns.  We had record taxable equivalent revenues totaling 2.8 billion, up 9.1% versus first quarter of '16 and up 7.6% annualized versus fourth quarter, so good revenue momentum, driven more by net interest margin, which increased 14 basis points to 3.46% versus fourth quarter. Our fee income ratio declined slightly to 42.1% versus 42.6%, but let me just make a point of emphasis here. Remember that it's down from where we typically had at around 44%, the reason is because our fee income ratio, every time we do a merger gets diluted because the smaller institutions just don't have all of the fee services that we have, that's one of the reasons we acquire these companies and so while it's down, there's really an indication of an alternative because over two or three years we'll bare all that fee income pack ended for those companies, so that's not a negative, it's just an implicit opportunity. If you're travelling with me still on slide 3, our GAAP efficiency ratio was 75%, again of the unusual items, so the adjusted efficiency ratio was 58%, which was down 59.5% in the fourth quarter. Credit had some of the [ph] outstanding quarter, credit improved across the boards, so NPAs, performing TDRs, delinquencies and net charge-offs all declined versus last quarter as for the great credit quality. If you're looking at our deck on slide 4, sort of mention a couple of selected items. The first is the loss on early extinguishment of debt where we - remember we announced in early January that we terminated 2.9 billion on FHLB advances and a pre-tax charge of 392 million which reduced earnings based cents per share, but remember, this increases run rate and margin going forward. We did have merger related restructuring charges of about 36 million of our pre-tax and that was $0.02 negative and impacted diluted EPS. And then we did we have excess tax benefit on equity based awards which you've been hearing about in further conference as well. This will be a recurring item temporarily in the first quarter, but remember, it could be up or down. So we're trying to take it out, but because of this follow up we just don't consider it a normal type of recurring item. If you look at page 5, we just want to give you a quick report guide if you will in kind of how we did relative to our guidance for the quarter. So if we divide the loans, we were little bit short of guidance, but as [indiscernible] that may be generally become right with rates being back down, but that's a little volatile and substantially out of our control. Credit quality was very consistent with our expectations. Net interest margin was a little better than our expectations given in our guidance. Noninterest income was as expected. Expenses were a little better and operating leverage at 10.5% was a little better. So overall we got most of the checks, a few check flushes and this month a little amount of negative, so we felt like that was a - we gave ourselves a nay on that. You could argue it's been 90 plus, we gave ourselves a nay anyway. So if you go to page 6, let's take look at loans. This is a really awesome quarter for us all to think about. So our underlying loan growth was very good relative to the market, I'll explain what I mean by that. If you look at our actual GAAP loan growth annualized, it was down 0.9%, but if you look at average loans underneath that, we had really good growth in a number of areas. So equipment finance was up 21%, Grandbridge was up 16%, commercial credit capital was up 10% and sales finance increased 297 million or 11%, but I'll point out that was primarily due to a portfolio purchase late in the fourth quarter. We did not plan any additional portfolio purchases in our foreseeable future survey for '17. The good news is that our C&I growth excluding mortgage warehouse was 4.5%, which was very good. That was growing substantially because of our community bank production which was up a lot compared to the first quarter of '16. In fact, the first quarter of production hike was our best in history and I say that because of the improvement in our main frame which I'll talk about in just a moment. Our expectation for GAAP growth for the first quarter is 1% to 3%. If you look at page 7, this is giving you a little bit more color with regard to what I call underlying loan growth. So we're really focused on optimizing our use of capital for lending. We think the marketplace today is not like it's been for the last couple of decades. You can't just grow loans in and out of '17. I think that's a good thing. It's really important to look at the kind of loans, the kind of credit implications and in particular the kind of returns you get relative to capital allocation, because as you know the capital allocation in our business today is a big deal since we are required to keep much more capital that we historically have. So, we are thinking in terms as you can see on that chart, we're thinking in terms of our loans today in three categories, our core categories, which is basically C&I, Community Bank, et cetera. Our seasonal portfolios, which is mortgaged warehouse lending and all the lending subsidiaries, which go up and down based on the seasonal factors and then what we're calling an optimizing portfolio, which are portfolios that we have decided for a number of reasons to allow to try over some period of time. It doesn't mean we are automatically out of the business. It just means right now we don't want to grow kind of run offs. So, if you think about our growth strategies within those three areas, obviously we're trying to grow the more profitable loans with better risk profiles. We are reducing exposure to prime auto given to low profitability and uncertain market outlook and it's not that we're concerned about our quality, it's just because we're very conservative on the underwriting. We don't take long-term positions et cetera. But the price you get under these loans today is just not attractive relative to the cap we have to allocate. So we're not out of the business, we're just backing our decisions about pricing and turn more conservative, more profitable. We continue our strategy to reduce exposure to residential mortgage and that's simply because of low probability and expectation of rising rates. So, if you look at our core and seasonal portfolios, our expectations for the second quarter is they will grow at a range of 5% to 7%. So, if you take those 5% to 7% minus the optimizing portfolios, they get you to the 1% to 3% growth as I mentioned earlier. But it's important to look at the underlying areas that we are trying to grow. They are growing nicely at 5% to 7% in this kind of margin. And that core growth was driven primarily by our corporate strategies, but largely by our Community Bank. I just want to make sure you understand with regard to Community Bank, this is a bit esoteric, but over the last eight years, Main Street has really struggled and we are primarily a Main Street lender. As you know, most of the growth in the market over the last several years has been by large companies who have been to a large capital type restructurings and have just paid it actively a very strong international market, which we don't participate in, but relative to a lot of our competitors, we had a harder go of it, because our focus on Main Street. Now we believe Main Street is changing, which I will talk about in a moment and getting better and so if it does, if it does get better and you should expect to see BB&T's loan potential do relatively better than many of our competitors who have been depending on the long growth coming from a lot of the largest corporations and their international exposure. So we just think BB&T's time has come. If you look at page eight on deposits, not a lot to say there. Our non-interest bearings were down, but that stays around, I think you all know that. With approval [ph] now that our batters remained low in the 10% to 15% for the last rate increase and frankly we think they are going to stay low. It's hard to know exactly, but we think they are going to stay low. Now, I'm going to take a minute before I turn to Daryl to give you a little bit of color with regard to what we're really trying to do from an executive leadership point of view in terms of moving forward. First, with regard to the marketplace, there is a lot of volatility and politically emotionalized marketplace today. Congress is kind of moving forward one day and moving better the next day, not a lot we can do about that. Nothing we do about. We do believe, though, that most likely is that they will get together. We think most likely is that over the next several months, maybe by the end of the year there is a decent chance. You'll see our revised health care program, a combined tax bill with infrastructure and improving regulation. No guarantees, of course, and there is a thousand opinions about that, but that's what we believe. And so, we think the market is getting better, but we're not waiting for the market to get better. We just think if that comes, that's nice. But we're doing what we can do. So, there are six focus areas that we're really, really energized about today. All have a big lift to our company. One of those is we're accelerating our growth in the Community Bank. As I said, as Main Street improves, then we will improve and I'll tell you regardless of all the skeptics about what's going on out there today, I've been - of our regions in the last few weeks and I'm talking to our lenders and I am talking to clients and I have once every other time I'm out there. I'll tell you the optimism is palpable. People are really excited. They are energized and they are not listening [indiscernible] in Congress. They might change their mind, but today they are excited and they're translating that and as I said they're talking about loans. We're getting loan request, new equipment, new buildings and more associates. So, it is happening. I can't guarantee as to what change would to happen, but it is happening today. We're going to accelerate our corporate banking loan growth. That's been a real star for us over the last several years, but we do have a really unique opportunity to continue to grow that at a faster pace. We are still really, really conservative in terms of our home positions and lower corporate exposures. We are going to increase this, so we are still going to be very conservative relative to a lot of peers. We can increase, may be plan that here and still be very conservative. So, you can expect to see our corporate loan growth continue to be very good. We're going to accelerate our growth, as well as or business. We have been working on it for several years. We are going to get that strategy developed. It is working extraordinarily well in terms of assets under management and in lending that's doing great. We can wrap it up to another year, which we're doing. We are optimizing our consumer portfolios as I mentioned with deemphasizing prime auto with regard to regional acceptance. We have a really good quality portfolio there relative to that particular space. You should know, though, over the last couple of years, we have been tightening the risk controls with regard to that area and our performance today is very good relative to the industry. Some industry is concerned about this, but if you look at the facts, you'll see that our performance is relatively very good and that's because we've been tightening way in advance our distribution [ph] in the market. And frankly we are increasing our pricing, so that our returns are better. So, that's part of that optimization portfolio. We are accelerating our focus on digital transformation. There are three areas in that we're really focused on. One is to continue to update our U platform. Recall that a year and a half ago, we introduced our U mobile interaction platform we believe is to be as an industry today. It's certainly in the top docile. But, yeah, we just keep investing in that every day and so we will do that. We're substantially ramping up our investment in advertising and social media and a very exciting area we are investing in improving processing cost is a big opportunity for us in frankly all banks to improve our process and cost by the use of AI and robotics. We will be pretty aggressive about that. We just think there is huge ways to reduce cost in the backroom by the use of that and then we have a very focused mortgage, residential mortgage profit improvement plans, which Chris is driving and that's all about driving efficiencies and add more producers and we think we will get substantially more performance out of that as we go forward. That's just a little bit of color in terms of our key focus areas. We think the rising tide will happen, but we are not going to wait. We will focus on these areas and they are all very opportunistic and very exciting. So, let me turn it now to Daryl for some more color. Daryl Bible : Thank you, Kelly, and good morning everyone. Today I'm going to talk about credit quality and interest margin, fee income, non-interest expense, capital or segment results and lastly provide some guidance for the second quarter. Turning to Slide 9, we had a really strong quarter with regard to credit quality, improving in all categories. Net charge-offs totaled $148 million, down slightly. Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing decreased 14.8%, loans 30 to 89 days past due decreased 25.3% due to seasonal improvement in our consumer-related portfolios. NPAs were down 1.5% from last quarter. Looking at the second quarter, we expect net charge-offs to remain in the range of 35 to 45 basis points assuming no unexpected deterioration in the economy and we expect NPAs to remain in a similar range. Turning to Slide 10, our allowance coverage ratios remain strong at 2.49 times for net charge-offs and 2.05 times for NPLs. The allowance to loans ratio was unchanged at 1.04%. Excluding acquired portfolios, the allowance to loans ratio remained at 1.13%. So, our effective allowance coverage remained strong. Provisions for credit losses matched net charge-offs at $148 million. Going forward, we expect loan loss provision to match charge-offs plus loan graph. Turning to Slide 11, compared to last quarter, net interest margin was 3.46%, up 14 basis points. Core margin was 3.28%, up 10 basis points versus last quarter. The increase in GAAP margin resulted mostly from higher earning asset yields, security through ration adjustments from prior quarter, the impact of the Federal Home Loan Bank termination, offset by slightly higher deposit betas due to the recent rate increase. As a reminder, we restructured $2.9 billion of Federal Home Loan Bank advances at the beginning in the first quarter and recorded a pretax loss of $392 million. Asset sensitivity improved driven by shrinking fixed rate loans such as auto and mortgage and continued growth in core deposits. Looking at the second quarter, core margin will be up 2 to 4 basis points due to their March rate increase. Looking at our GAAP margin, we will be relatively flat on a linked quarter basis due to the decline in purchase accounting benefits. Continuing on Slide 12, our noninterest income ratio was 42.1%, down slightly, primarily due to the increase in net interest income. Noninterest income totaled $1.2 billion, up 3.1% from last quarter. Our fee income changes included an increase of $39 million in insurance income, mostly driven by seasonality and employee benefit commissions. This was offset by investment banking and brokerage commissions to several large deals that closed last quarter. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect fee income to increase 6% to 8% versus second quarter of last year. Turning to Slide 13, noninterest expenses totaled $2.1 billion, excluding the $392 million Federal Home Loan Bank restructuring charge, merger-related charges, and the mortgage reserve adjustment from the prior quarter, core noninterest expenses were slightly below $1.7 billion, down 2.9% from last quarter. Personnel expense was up slightly driven by a $34 million increase in payroll taxes and equity-based compensation. Approximately $25 million of that increase was due to seasonal FICA expense and 401(k) match. This was offset by FTE reductions and a $28 million decrease in salaries and incentives. Loan-related expense increased $36 million, largely due to our prior quarter release of $31 million in more repurchase reserves. Going forward, expenses are expected to be flat to up 2% versus second quarter of last year, excluding merger-related and restructuring charges. Also please note the effective tax rate is expected to return to a 30% range next quarter. Turning to Slide 14, our capital and liquidity remained strong. Common equity tier 1 was 10.1% fully phased-in. LCR was 124% and our liquid asset buffer remains very strong at 12.7%. Dividend payout ratio was 64% on a GAAP basis to due to the Federal Home Loan Bank restructuring with our total payout of 106%. We are currently targeting a total payout in excess of 100% with our recently submitted CCAR '17 capital plan. Now, let's look at segment results beginning on Slide 15. Community Bank net income totaled $334 million, essentially flat. But our commercial loan production is a very good indicator of Main Street is right now. This is the vast quarter we've ever seen. We're continuing to focus on efficiency and you can see that our operating margin improved to 40.6% in the first quarter. We believe we can further improve efficiency in the Community Bank as we continue to look at opportunities to right-size the branch network. Turning to Slide 16, residential Mortgage Banking net income was $48 million, down from last quarter. Net interest income decreased $12 million primarily due to lower average balances. Noninterest expense increased $36 million due to a higher loan processing expense driven by $31 million release of mortgage repurchase reserves. Production mix was 52% purchase and 48% refi and again on our sale margins were 1.01, up from 0.86 last quarter. Looking to Slide 17, Dealer Financial Services income totaled $29 million, down from last quarter. This was due to the slight decrease in net interest income, driven by the decline in credit spreads on the loans caused by a more competitive marketplace. The provision for credit losses increased $9 million, mostly driven by higher charge-offs and regional acceptance and higher loss severity trends. Charge-offs in regional acceptance increased to 8.9% this quarter. However, the risk adjusted yield remains strong at 8.7%. We continue to manage to lower LTVs. Next quarter's charge-off rate should be much better due to seasonality dropping significantly lower than 8%. Charge-offs for the prime portfolio remained excellent at 16 basis points. Turning to Slide 18, Specialized Lending net income totaled $50 million, up $4 million from last quarter. We had strong year-over-year loan growth and production growth in Premium Finance, Sheffield, Equipment Finance, and Government Finance. We expect seasonally strong growth in Specialized Lending in the second quarter approaching mid-teens annualized versus first quarter of this year. Looking on Slide 19, Insurance Holdings net income totaled $47 million, up $13 million from last quarter. Noninterest expense totaled $389 million, up $15 million from last quarter, driven by higher incentive expense and payroll and defined contribution expense partially offset by a decline in salary expense. The higher noninterest income from last quarter primarily reflects seasonality employee benefit commissions. Adjusting from the timing of profit commissions, organic growth was up approximately 1%. Turning to Slide 20, Financial Services had $91 million in net income, down from last quarter. This was mostly due to lower investment banking, client derivative, and private equity investment income. Corporate banking had strong loan growth of 8%, while it generated strong loan and deposit growth of 11% and 36% from last quarter. On Slide 21, I'd like to summarize our outlook for the second quarter. We expect loan growth in the range of 1% to 3% annualized versus first quarter. We expect to see growth in commercial, specialized, direct retail, and revolving credit. In credit quality, we expect net charge-offs and NPAs to be stable compared to first quarter. We expect linked quarter GAAP margin to remain stable and linked quarter core margin to be up to the 4 basis points driven by the March rate increase. We expect net interest income to increase 2% to 4% annualized versus last quarter. We expect noninterest income to increase 6% to 8% versus second quarter of last year. Excluding merger-related and restructuring charges, expenses will be flat to up 2% versus second quarter of last year. In summary, we had strong earnings performance, excellent credit quality, increasing core and GAAP margins and good expense control for the quarter. Now, let me turn it back over to Kelly for closing remarks and Q&A. Kelly King : Thanks, Daryl. So, just to reemphasize we think it was a great start to solid operating earnings, good expense control as Daryl described. We have future opportunities to continue to rationalize expense structure and our mergers and rationalized expense structure in our branches, including branch closures. And so, when you put all that together with our focus on our six focal areas, we think the opportunity for us to continue to improve is very good. The key is on the consistent in our execution, which is what we're going to take very good about. Now, I will turn it to Alan. Alan Greer : Okay, thank you, Kelly. At this time we'll start the Q&A session. Debbie, if you could come back on the line and explain how our listeners may participate in the session. Operator : Thank you, gentlemen. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to John McDonald with Bernstein. John McDonald : Hi, good morning guys. Kelly King : Good morning. John McDonald : The fee income looked good this quarter and the guide for growth for the second quarter, 6% to 8% year-over-year, wondering what you see as some of the drivers of the fee income improvement year-over-year. And then also on the insurance, you had a good quarter. Could you just speak to the economics of that business whether you are seeing any improvement in pricing and some of the trends there? Chris Henson : Hey, John, this is Chris. Fee income is certainly one of the drivers and next quarter will be insurance. I'll come back to that in just a moment. We're going to see we believe investment banking doing much better. We have, just as Daryl said, a little of pullback. In fact, we had a number of deals that sort of popped in the fourth quarter, so we see that pipeline building back. We think that could be in 10 to 12, maybe in 13% kind of range. We think mortgage has - mortgage pipeline with rates down and beginning to rebuild a bit. That won't be a big quarter, but we think we could see a little bit of pickup there and then trust investment grocery up slightly, so then all the other check cards would be up a bit as well. Going back to insurance to follow-up on your question, first quarter is always seasonally strong in the sense, as Daryl said, we get good EB pickup, because that's the only one of those contracts we kind of build, but second quarter is actually our best quarter of the year. So, we see possibility to be up 5% or 6% kind of range second quarter and that business I would say underlying, we're very happy with the trends we are seeing. While pricing is still down in the 3% to 4% range, our core organic growth is up 1%. So, we're really outpacing the pricing through underlying new business growth and we're seeing that in our core business and Internet services, which is across the banking footprint. That grew 11% in new business production this year, I mean, this quarter. Our California business grew about 15% and wholesale, you might recall, we converted Swett & Crawford into CRC, our primary wholesale business this quarter. We actually expected it to be down and it was really about flat, so really a good pickup there. And then our life business was up about 8.3%. So, all in all we had a really good quarter seasonally. We tend to see them drift, which is our large in retail down that fourth quarter is sort of their best quarter. So, all in all really good overall performance in insurance and I mean clearly we're taking market share in footprint. John McDonald : Okay. Thanks, Chris and Daryl, just a follow-up. When you coupled that fee income outlook with the expense guide, what are you thinking for the progression of the efficiency ratio as you look at your adjusting number of first quarter going into second quarter and the rest of the year? Daryl Bible : John, I mean every quarter we're always out trying to achieve positive operating leverage. When you look at second quarter, we do have an uptick in expenses just for seasonality and we continue to have our technology investments. So, I would say second quarter is too close to call right now. But we feel very confident we will have positive operating leverage, improved efficiency on a year-over-year basis. Basically in the second half of the year we're really seeing a kick-in. John McDonald : Great, okay, thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Kelly, and good morning, Daryl. Daryl Bible : Good morning, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Kelly, I want to follow up on your comment about artificial intelligence and robots. Where do you think you are in that process? Is it the first inning or not even the game hasn't even started yet? And what do you envision over the next two or three years on what this could do to your operating expenses by making you more efficient? Kelly King : So, Gerrard, as it were, it's sort of in the first inning. We've actually tested some areas to be sure that we are so comfortable with the whole concept of AI and robotics working. Just to give an example, Daryl did a test in his financial reconcilement area, so we took one process where a human working with a computer took two hours to do the track and solve the process. Once we applied AI and robotics, it was only in 15 minutes. So, we are engaging some people specialized in this area to help us over time. We will learn how to do this for ourselves, but we are using outside expertise. I think it's a big deal, Gerard. When we get our methodology being fine-tuned, we'll boost up the entire company starting with the most sensitive opportunities and then moving down. It's hard at this stage of the game, but this is kind of saying that allows us to invest into new areas if we need to invest and like digital, new markets et cetera and really keep a tight lid on the background expenses. That's why we're optimistic in terms of longer term operating leverage, because we will have to continue to invest in new technologies et cetera, but at the same time we'll simultaneously reduce on the cost our traditional process-oriented activities and frankly I'm pretty excited about it. It's a bit early if you were to claim victory but the concept is really sound. Gerard Cassidy : And in talking about this, what's your total technology budget for, not just for this, but when you look at tech spending this year, what kind of number you're looking at? Chris Henson : Gerrard, this is Chris. Of our $11 billion in revenue, we probably - CapEx is probably in the 4% to 5% range, so four to $500 million. The grand majority of it frankly would be technology spends. It could be of a sample structure, so I was compliance, but we actually are spending a lot of time. We actually changed the way that we have visibility that this is going to really begin to try to tweak away from compliance and allocate more of those dollars toward discretionary digital and revenue client service kind of efforts. That obviously will take some time, but if that pivot is appropriate we think for this point in time and a good chunk of that would be digital as well. Gerard Cassidy : Great and then just as a second question, Daryl, on the LCR, I think you said you're about 124%. If regulations change and you're not held to an LCR ratio as other banks and again I know this is kind of far-fetched. But what's a more comfortable number if you were mandated to be carrying this LCR at the level you're carrying in now? Daryl Bible : Yeah, we probably have some room for it to come back down, maybe down about 20%, 25% give-or-take. I mean it's definitely adding a lot of value, it's lowered everybody's profitability returns. It's not efficient use of the balance sheet. So, we can definitely bring it down and over time we can continue to optimize portfolio on the balance sheet. Gerard Cassidy : Great, thank you, guys. Operator : We'll go next to Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Hi. I was wondering if you could talk a bit more on the expense side. The expenses were lower than certainly we had expected this quarter. The rhetoric around expense efforts that you have to match cost seems quite positive. But on the outlook for the second quarter was a little bit higher than I would have thought. So, maybe just square at all and I - if I recall correctly, you talked about costs being below $1.7 billion on average, I think you would imply a little bit higher for the second quarter. So, just square all the kind of expense moving pieces that I laid out there. Kelly King : So, Matt, obviously there are a lot of moving pieces. Second quarter you get some season rate increase and all of our salary increases kick in and [indiscernible] you get that. We are still in the midst of spending frankly a lot of money on resolving our BSA AML issue improving that platform. We're way down the road with regard to that, but expenses are still building and will probably continue to build through the second quarter after which it will plateau and come down. At the end of the year, that will be down but it's probably going to be up in the second quarter. So - and then technology, of course, is always kind of high. So, you got your normal seasonal in the second quarter. You got your consistent technology and some spiking in BSA, which will probably substantially grow up in the second quarter relative to first and then you get that baggage ahead towards the end of the year. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then just think about the $1.7 billion on average for this year or below the $1.7 billion, is that still a reasonable target all in? Kelly King : Yeah, I think so when you go down. Daryl Bible : Yeah, I think once we get through the pick that Kelly talked about through the next quarter or so, I think we will be back closer to 1.7 or maybe a little bit below that. Matt O'Connor: Okay, great. Operator : We'll go next to Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Kevin Barker : Thank you. In regards to your comments regarding regional acceptance corp, you mentioned 8.9% net charge-off for this quarter and you've changed your underwriting standards. Have you seen a dramatic improvement in your credit losses and your charge-offs following the changing underwriting standards? Or are you still seeing some credit softness across the space in auto for those type FICOs? Clarke Starnes : Hey, Kevin, this is Clarke. Certainly, we have seen improvement particularly starting to turn in our 30 to 60, 60 to 90 in non-performers and that makes us feel really good about the losses coming down and leveling off as we move forward. I would remind you our actual losses were actually 8.6 for the first versus 8% last year, full year last year with 7.33, we think there is a high probability of things whole that we could bring losses in for 2017 at a similar level to '16. So, what we've been experiencing in the industry has been experiencing this big hit on severity, Majority of the subprime lenders are financing smaller compact cars. And while the overall main hand has been fairly stable, it's really been hit hard on the small cars and so the severity is what we've been hit with. The good news is our underwriting changes that we began really in the third quarter of 2015 are kicking in and it offset a lot of that. So, I think you look at a lot of the ABS subprime pools. Losses are still going up and they're north of 10%. So, we think we're doing a lot better. But we think it will be continued challenge for those that have not made the appropriate adjustments. Kevin Barker : Okay. And then in your opinion, do you feel that you're going to start to see a settling out of residual values sometime this year or do you feel like it's something that could occur next year given the stress we've seen in used car prices? Clarke Starnes : It's a great question. I think there is still risk of more deterioration. However, I will say in March, as we came through the quarter, we did see some firming to a degree particularly in that smaller car segment, but - and the overall index was more or less flat. But generally we're hopeful that we may have seen the worst, but it may not have been and we believe the underwriting changes we've made will help mitigate it even if it softens a little further. Kevin Barker : Okay. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : We'll go next to Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Matt Burnell : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Kelly and Daryl, maybe you could drill down a little bit into your commentary about increasing the efficiency within the Community Bank. Obviously, there was a nice improvement this quarter. But what are you doing now to drive that efficiency ratio down going forward specifically? Kelly King : So, let me give you a general response, Matt, and I will let Chris to drill down a little bit further. So, we win on a several year process rationalizing our expense structure in the Community Bank. The most obvious of that is downsizing the number of tellers and platform people as the number of transactions have been coming down about 4% a year for us for the last several years. So, we in account cortically following that decrease in transaction is relatively downsizing the number of platform participants. That continues. We are accelerating our focus on the consolidations' closing branches. We did 40 or so last year with respect to 100 or so neighborhood this year. We don't believe branches are going away, but the fact is the dynamics around what's been closed today versus what we closed five, 10 years ago changed, because of a substantial increase in digital transaction capability and usage of our clients and so five digital capabilities are very, very good. People are gravitating to that and that's giving us more comfort in terms of different kind of branch closures than we've done in the past. So, let me let Chris give you more color on that. Chris Henson : Yeah, thanks, Kelly. I think Kelly is exactly right. I mean consolidated teller and the relationship banker role and something we call branch banker that really was done 18 months or so ago and we're really kind of hitting our stat there and that has certainly created some efficiency sort of in the branch. Secondly, as you heard, we've had two of our best quarters in terms of just outright revenue production in one production. Just to give you some sense, commercial loan production over a year ago was up 22%, retail up about 25%, so we're - as we commented at the front end of the call, we really are seeing Main Street come back. I mean these are the people. Our portfolios are much more granular than peers typically our size and I mean these are the people that really sort of go represent all of us. They believe that we are seeing them kind of work with their financials. I think thirdly the comment on the branches is something that we really try to take and heed and be sure for it about but yet be on our front foot and so we did about 2% reductions last year. Kelly said transaction was down about 4%. We think we would do 100 or so this year and these are typically branches that are within markets where we have a good brand feel in those markets and we don't think we've been testing them a lot and we don't see a lot of loss of business. We are monitoring that pretty closely. Part of the reason is beginning to transition more towards our digital efforts and so we've got in our retail business about 4.6 million clients. We have about 60% of them that are using - actively using digital technology today and business about 50% is using digital technology. The retail clients, which is really about 2.5 million that are digital clients, about three quarters of those are using our new U platform. So, it gives us a real opportunity to kind of scale up, not only those who are using, to help them fully utilize that technology, but then also bring in another couple of million over on the system. So, tremendous amount of opportunity gives us I think a really good platform that can offload some of these branches frankly because they have a new channel that they become accustomed and accountable to working with. So, today we've got about 30% of our transactions being done digitally and I think that helps enable this whole branch optimization strategy. Matt Burnell : And this is for my follow-up, could you provide a little more color on your commentary about improving the corporate banking loan growth. You mentioned increasing the whole size as one area that you're considering, but are there specific industries within the corporate banking platform that you're going to target as well? Clarke Starnes : Hey, Matt, this is Clarke. I will answer that. As far as specific industries, we may have mentioned over the last four or five years, we've built a number of specific industry verticals and experienced corporate bankers and those would be the focal areas for us as a pretty diversified set of industry, so that's nothing really new. There is just - we're still early in that, taken advantage of that build out that we've already done. So, that's where we would play areas where we have expertise and specialization. But as far as our relative commitments, we are very granular. We look at syndications - we're in the same transaction with our peers. We tend to have commitments that are anywhere from 50% to thirds of the average of the group. So, we think we can move that up marginally given the size of our company and still have a more granular portfolio. But that alone combined with those new verticals gives us a great growth opportunity. Kelly King : And as we increase those exposures, we're going to get a bigger piece of that. Matt Burnell : Okay. Thanks for the color, gentlemen. Operator : We'll take our next question from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Marty Mosby : Good morning. Kelly King : Good morning. Marty Mosby : I wanted to ask you about capital payout ratio and you mentioned that it was going to be above 100% as you looked into next year. I think the 100%, 106% this quarter, would that be against with merger-related cost and some of that restructuring in the number? So, we're looking at next year with all the merger-related costs and everything. Daryl Bible : Yeah, Marty, to be honest with you, we really don't expect many more merger-related. We might have a little bit more restructuring costs as Chris talked about maybe in branches and all that. But it's not going to be a meaningful number going forward. So, the total payout ratio of 100% will be half of our GAAP net income, but I wouldn't see there could be any significance from a run rate perspective. Marty Mosby : Got you. And then when you look at the liquidity coverage ratio of 124, you already, even without changing it, have room to deploy that liquidity. If I kind of roll back to where you sliced out the loan portfolio, you've got about 30% of your own portfolio in that optimizing kind of category. If you think about, there is the ability like you said this is deflating returns in earnings to utilize that excess capital even under the current construction of the regulation and constraints. Why are we looking at this optimizing portfolio, especially residential mortgages, which you know while rates could go up you still can build that portfolio with a high yielding portfolio to use some of that liquidity. Marty Mosby : I think that's in the lines of what we're thinking as we right size and optimize both prime auto and mortgage businesses those will probably come down some overtime which gave us higher returns for the whole balance sheet or increase overall profitability. We are exiting those businesses, they're still quarter our company still very important, but there are just really low return businesses, so from mortgage we're still selling anything we can conforming, but we're keeping a good jumble clients and some low good [indiscernible] from that perspective and prime auto is just really, really competitive right now, and I think there's probably better uses of our capital and other loan areas. Daryl Bible : So to your question the way I think about this is, while those portfolios are optimizing, remember we are accelerating growth and our core portfolios. And the best case is to optimizing portfolios run down to core portfolios run up, the years get better kind of relationships et cetera only you yields up you don't build up, you don't build additional liquidity which some things on the line issue in your question. So if there were not to happen now and yes, we do have some opportunity to reduce some of that liquidity and term and to reduce funding because there are other types of sort of security types of investments. So we have a lot of leverage to pool, but the lever is replacing optimize portfolios but core portfolios. Kelly King : As you increase the profitability in a company and our balance sheet growth wouldn't be as much because all kind of trading that gives us much more confidence to happen much higher pay off to stay very strong from a capital perspective. Marty Mosby : This streams with the optimizing portfolio being almost a third of the overall portfolio, the math of trying to balance the acceleration to offset it comes pretty challenging they'll try to overcome the drag that's coming from that large of a percent of your portfolio? Kelly King : But it is to keep in mind more of that the more important whether your [indiscernible] as not as quick of restructuring that you might think. Marty Mosby : Okay, thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Amanda Larsen : Hi everyone, this is Amanda Larsen on for Ken. Kelly King : Good morning. Amanda Larsen : Are you at the point where you'd look to growth security balances or do you expect to say a bit cash heavy with the anticipation of better loan growth in 2H? Kelly King : Amanda we look at it right now is, we're very comfortable with our security balances, now we're well about 20% give or take of our balance sheet is in securities very parish from that perspective. We got a question earlier of LCR goes away though should we adjust that will kind of how that plays out. Now as far as increasing security balances at the end of the day it's still a lower earning asset so you really don't want to have you want to have enough on the books for your liquidity, but you really don't want to have too much on there, because it's not going to improve your returns, and it's probably not a great capital use. Daryl Bible : And it's not particularly good time and there are the securities when you going right for us. Kelly King : That's right. Amanda Larsen : Okay. And then your deposits bit of continue to be very low; can talk about how industry deposit expiring versus your expectation and also your willingness to be more competitive given the opportunity that you see on the asset side? Kelly King : Yeah so, I think the whole industry including us have been modeling deposit data has to be moving much higher than what's actually playing out reality. You look at the first two increases that we had last year and then this year and December, our deposit data is for less than 10%. So one that we just had in March we're expecting that to be probably 10% to 15% range. So we've been modeling data has between 40% and 60% requesting much higher in that. And we're just seeing it much more muted on the retail side. We are paying up and being aggressive to our corporate clients and we have to - but for the most part it's just much lower. The forecast that we gave you, but that includes is you know two more rate increases later this year, one in the middle of the year and one at the end of the year, and we model of conservative data, so we're looking for data is be up 30% to 35% next time that could be opportunity if that's not going to happen, and then the one at the end of the year we're modeling that to be 40% to 50% which CFL plays out could be another opportunity price. Amanda Larsen : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Saul Martinez with UBS. Saul Martinez : Hi, thanks for taking my question, good morning. First question is sort of more of a big picture question Kelly, you've been pretty consistent in terms of expressing optimism about policy reforms sentiment amongst your clients I mean American proving the outlook for better economic growth. But until now there has been something of disconnect between sentiment indicators and core data whether would be a loan growth or some poor economic data more broadly. Do you think there is a risk that optimism starts to fade, if we don't get policy changes if dysfunction in Washington continues however you want to term it at what point do you think your client - at what point do you start to worry that the optimism that is building that you've expressed starts to keep become more muted? Kelly King : Well, I think there is kind of the big - really big question for us all right now. First of all with regard to why has the increased optimism not yet shown up in hard data, that's not pricing it all to me because remember a period of time, we're going to have 90 or sort of days, and it takes a period of time for that optimism to translate into evaluating what kind of projects you're going to do or you're going to buy, et cetera. But as I said earlier, we are already seeing that. We are seeing actual hard data were clients are talking to us about expansions, I can loan requests for expansions, but frankly out of rate we haven't seen in eight years so that's why we said our community banks having it's best production ever, it is happening for us on Main Street. Now the question implicit in your question is, if they don't do anything in Washington do that chill it could stop it. And the answer is obviously yes. If they make no progress in Washington at all then eventually that optimism will turn to pessimism and now return into the reduction and spending and that were return into has more economic growth, and is it do really do a badly business sort of capable of then all return into recession. But here is the reason that the resiliency of the activity in the marketplace will be stronger than you might think. Remember that eight plus years these companies have not been investing. They're using 20 year old computers. They're driving trucks of 300,000 plus miles. At some point regardless of how frugal you want to believe you can't got a replacement of few computer and buy few trucks. And then the other thing is kind of a psychology and that is after feeling bad and conservative and not invest in fair reviews [ph] you kind of want to invest. So number one, they need to invest, number two, they want to invest. So that's why you're seeing this really little excitement out there today. I don't think it will wine immediately, but by the end of the year let's say if there's been no positive movement on taxes regulation, healthcare and all that combined then I will be very worried to be honest. And so my message to Congress which I sent chance I get is, there's a lot riding on them get their right together and you know we're talking about a future for our kids and our grandkids, we have a wonderful opportunity here to grow this country at much faster pace and shame on them if they don't execute. Saul Martinez : That's helpful. Have you seen any increases in utilization rates thus far? Kelly King : No, not really, if so what we're seeing if the actual longer quiz which are moving through the pipeline, so we've got the production numbers which show substantially you have pipeline substantially up, as we head on into the set of quarter that will began to - that will be a nice show up and increase loan activity that's why we would say in our core portfolio we're projecting 4%, 5% growth in that for the second quarter because of that activities shown to reality. Saul Martinez : Okay, that's great. That's helpful. Thanks a lot. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Good morning. Kelly King : Good morning John. John Pancari : Given the size of the optimization portfolios and everything, can you just talk about your expectations for where loan growth could trend in 2018, if we do see the macro improvement and Kelly as you said, if we see the tax reform and infrastructure reform et cetera, is there likely to be optimization portfolios at that point or do they go away and we get overall loan growth in the high single digits instead of mid single digits. How should we think about that? Kelly King : Well, I'll give you - and Clarke can respond. Maybe we are expecting in this quarter the portfolio that will continue to increase if everything else holds constant in terms of the workable climate et cetera. Then as for the optimization portfolios gets lower and lower then that will translate into higher and higher, so we're already moving this year's total - this quarter's total long projections from slightly down last quarter to 1% to 3% this quarter. That was certain to move on though. When you get to a run rate of optimization portfolios being merged out, yeah, you have been asking resurgence [ph], but does take a little bit of time to happen. Clarke Starnes : Absolutely yeah, I certainly think you could see the 5 to 6, to 6 to 8 as this thing gets legs and moves forward, so certainly the opportunity is there. John Pancari : Okay, alright thanks and then could you talk a little bit about the banks overall exposure to the retail industry. Sorry, if I missed any comments on that front, but just interested in the exposure in the CRE book as well as your C&I portfolio. Clarke Starnes : Sure John, we think about it generally a three book as I know, there's a lot of ways to define that when you all ask that question, but the way we think about it as for as our CRE book. So where we have specific exposure to retail centers and retail leases through operators, it's about $4.1 billion exposure. We generally get about that almost 70% of that would be what we consider neighborhood anchored type grocery centers, those sorts of things very granular, very high occupancy right now, so it certainly bothers risk, we feel good about that. We have about $600 million level outstanding through REIT space and retail of which the 80% of those are investment grade and very conservative in how we underwrite there. And then as far as direct retailer exposure, we have about $1.3 billion in outstanding there and probably 30%, 40% of that flashes to investment grade. So while we're certainly cognizant about issues and the structural changes that the ecommerce and other trends are having in that space, we feel like it's certainly performing well now and manageable as we look forward. John Pancari : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Nancy Bush : Good morning guys. I just Kelly, wanted to ask, I mean you talked about the optimism and the economy et cetera, et cetera. North Carolina has had some of its own unique issues to deal with over the past years, so I mean, have you seen any blips in business activity there? There were all kinds of threats made et cetera, et cetera and has that issue impacted things? Kelly King : No, there's been a lot of talk about it, there's been a lot of innuendos, but the actual optimism out there in North Carolina is very, very bullish, very positive into business community, they have to drive regions in North Carolina very strong. I'm not saying it couldn't happen, as you know since that was protected over a long period of time and I'm not saying it's not nice to have the best alternate terms here and all, but that's not the drivers of the primary economy. So drivers of the primary economy has not been impacted by this and so I'm glad we've - I'm glad we've kind of got it behind us because it puts a negative look on North Carolina that is not as loud and I'm glad it's behind us, but it had a material impact on the [indiscernible]. Nancy Bush : Okay, this is a follow up. This sort of dividing of the loan portfolio into these three buckets, is this something that just happened or is this been ongoing and I'm very curious about optimizing portfolio, is that a new designation or is this been around for a while and you just now named it? Chris Henson : We just named it Nancy. Frankly, it's been a strategy we've been using for some period of time. We felt that frankly our message wasn't being as clearly understood and so we just thought naming it will help per say and I think it will because it's very rational. I mean if you kind of look at a quarter negative point terms and long guidance level, what's good about that, but when you look under it and you say the quarter is doing well, the seasonal down, yeah, you got to optimize because you're breaking the profitability that makes me feel pretty good. Nancy Bush : Alright, thank you. Chris Henson : Thanks, Nancy. Operator : We'll go next to Jennifer Demba with SunTrust. Jennifer Demba : Thank you, good morning. Just curious if you could get some more color on the anticipated resolution of your BSA/AML issues and what your thoughts are about your M&A height is and when that might be lifted. Kelly King : As far as BSA/AML front, we're making really good progress even though the market only heard about it in the last few months, we've been working on it probably a year and a half. I think in terms of execution on the actual processes to be a first class BSA/AML shops, we're in the ninth inning [ph], more work to do, we're well in the ninth inning. And then you got the validation period of time where you have to satisfy your sales and the regulators that your processes are working, that will take a period of time. I think we have a pretty good shot of moving through this constrain order in a relatively rapid period of time. Solvency has three to four yearlong which is what people worry about, I mean I think as extremely remote for us. The kind of problems we have with pure process, we didn't have the - any FY evaluations, any money laundering those kind of things, we just had some process things we needed to change to meet the standards today. And so we're well along that. We have a really, really great experience BSA officer that actually worked and wrote most of the regulations, so we are very confident that we will be exiting this in the reasonably foreseeable future. Of course the M&A thing is restricted in terms of typical commercial banks and the area is not absolutely determined that you can't do one but it's practical money problem where they were branched on a regular commercial bank item that is centered to feel time. We think we do have flexibility to do other acquisitions in terms of technological space and insurance space et cetera and we sort of still continue to pursue those. But I don't think the future of our M&A activity is sort of far as some people may think and as I've said earlier that's still an important part of our long term strategy. I still believe we're going to see a pretty good and fast consolidation of the industry because once you get there, all of their proposed - I've talked about changes and taxes and regulations et cetera, et cetera. Hopefully that rising tide hits all the ship, putting all the ships on the same rising tide, so each of your scales that we talked about repeatedly is still there. We think the foundation is super mix and we still think it to be a part of our future. Jennifer Demba : Thanks, so much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. Mr. Greer, I'll turn it back to you for any closing remarks. Alan Greer : Okay, thank you Debbie and thanks to you everyone for joining us today.

You may refer to Page 2 and the appendix of the presentation for the appropriate reconciliations to GAAP results. And now, I will turn it over to Kelly. Kelly King : Thanks, Alan and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our call. We will appreciate it. So we had a strong second quarter record earnings, record revenues, good expense control and best returns in almost three years. So looking at some of the highlights, our record net income $631 million up 16.6% versus second quarter 2016. Diluted EPS was $0.77 but when you adjust for depending on merc charges its $0.78 up 9.9% versus coming quarter. Our returns were strong, ROA, ROA common equity, return on tangible common were 1.22%, 9.30% and 15.6% respectively. Record taxable equivalent revenues totaled $2.9 million up 3.9% verses second quarter and also up 10.7% annualized versus the first quarter. Our net interest margin on GAAP increased 1 basis point to 3.47% versus the first quarter. Our core net interest margin increased 3 basis points 3.31% versus the first quarter. And we had a nice increase on our fee income ratio increased 42.7% from 42.1%, as a function of our continuing to leverage. Our fee income businesses into the new acquisitions up in Pennsylvania and in other new markets. Our GAAP efficiency ratio was 61%, but if you adjust as we normally do efficiency ratio was 58.6% versus 58%, so up a tick. But I would point out to you that we\u2019ve been talking about for the last two or three years, these major projects we\u2019ve been working on. These major projects are wrapping up. Expenses are peaking. We would expect over the next several months and quarters, these projects are continued to be wrapped up that these expenses will not only peak, but slowly decline. I\u2019ll point out specifically that most of the BSA/AML work has been done. We\u2019re in the 98-plus percentile in terms of getting all of that worked done, there will be some time in terms of it to mature, in terms of the exited from the consent order. But that\u2019s not the same kind of expense level than building to program So you can expect our BSA expense levels to begin to decline as we head into the third and fourth quarter. Credit quality is fantastic. Our core and financial questions about that was just fantastic all over across the board. NPAs, performing TDRs, 90 days or more past due to net charge-offs all declined versus the last quarter. We are clearly at pristine credit quality at the company. Importantly, in terms of our CCAR application, as you saw, it was approved. That includes a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.33, which we expect the board to approve next week. We also have approved up to $1.88 billion in share repurchases. We indicated we would repurchase $920 million in the third quarter. That is this quarter, and that will be done as soon as possible. Even so, our common equity Tier 1 ratio remains strong at 10.3%. I did point out on Page 4 the one special item. I won\u2019t spend much time on that. That\u2019s just $10 million, $0.01 impact in terms of merger and restructuring charges. On Page 5 in your slide deck, just point out that we think we did a good job with regard to meeting or exceeding guidance. On the loan side, we were on the high side of our loan \u2013 total loan range of 1% to 3%. Core guidance was 5% to 7%, and we were on the outside of that, in fact, beat it at 7.5%. Credit quality was low, on the low side. NPAs actually declined. Our net interest income was above the range. We\u2019ve said 3% to 4%, and we were at 6.3%, and all others net. So the point is we thought we had a relatively aggressive guidances, and we met or exceeded those guidances. Now if you turn to Page 6, I want to give you a little commentary with regard to the loan area. So we\u2019ve been talking the last few quarters, and we really want to make sure everybody understands what we\u2019re trying to do. What I think about in terms of excellent execution of a complex set of profit improving loan strategies. So what it means is that if you look at our total loan performance, it was up 3%, which is very good in the industry today. But if you look at C&I, for example, we were up 6.1%. If you look CRE combined between IPP and construction and development, it\u2019s a strong 7%. We had strong performance seasonally adjusted, to some degree, but in a number of our fee \u2013 Specialized Lending areas, for example, Sheffield was up 20.3%, premium finance was up 15%. So very, very strong performance there. I would point out to you that our Community Bank experienced the best quarterly commercial production in its history. Main Street is optimistic. I\u2019ll come in a bit more on that in a minute, but it is definitely beginning to flow through in terms of better production and closings with regard to our Community Bank. A little more color on these various portfolios we\u2019re looking at on Page 7. So we told you last quarter to try and make it clear, we\u2019re breaking our portfolio out into three categories, and we have strategies around those. So we have our core nonseasonal portfolio, our core seasonal portfolio and then the portfolio, which is self financed and residential mortgages, which we call an optimizing portfolio. I\u2019m going to explain to you what that means. So in the longer strategy, we are simply focus on growing the more profitable loans with better risk profile. This is not a game about how fast you grow loans. This is a game about how fast you can grow profitability. And so we are focusing on growing, albeit a little slower than we could be growing, but growing profits fast about focusing on the most profitable loans. We continue to price our prime auto portfolio at a level, which substantially improves profitability and returns. That has caused that called that portfolio to shrink, to some degree. We\u2019re better off currently and in long-term by having better profitability. I would point out to you though that, that does not mean that we\u2019re getting out of auto, does not mean we\u2019re getting out of mortgage. We are simply rationalizing while optimizing the portfolios to stabilize them at a level that gets to the current profit projections that we are expecting. So if you think about our loan growth going forward, we will have stronger core growth for a quarter or two than the total because of those optimizing portfolios. But you should now expect, like prime auto and residential mortgage, to go away. In fact, we expect it to stabilize as we\u2019re in 2018 around the second quarter. It\u2019s not as hard to project exactly, but probably around the second quarter of 2018, we expect those to stabilize. And I would presume to point out we are still in the auto business. We\u2019re still in the business of meeting our clients\u2019 needs on home mortgage financing, and we expect to remain there. So our third quarter expectations are that our core loans are expected to grow 5% to 7%, which I think is pretty strong in this economy, which has still not totally taken off yet. As you combine, again, it\u2019s 1% to 3%, and I would guess on the high side of that. I just want to mention to you again that Main Street continues to rebound. Our confidence is up. I\u2019ve been in 23 of our 26 regions in the last few months. Every single region is reporting in terms of \u2013 and I\u2019m talking to the people that are making the loans, everyone is talking about increased optimism on the part of small- and medium-sized businesses. Main Street, as I\u2019ve talked about over the years, has been kind of dead in the water for the last seven or eight years. Larger businesses were doing well, because of a lot of international transactions. Main Street business, though, didn\u2019t participate in that. And so they are now seeing more activity in terms of confidence, in terms of clients buying from them. They are, therefore, more willing to invest. We see that, in fact, in our pipelines. And we see that, in fact, into production as I continue \u2013 as I mentioned earlier, Community Bank\u2019s having a strong production ever. So I think that will continue to build as we go forward, and it\u2019s really good for BB&T. BB&T is basically a Main Street bank. We\u2019ve struggled over the last seven or eight years in loan growth while Main Street was struggling. Main Street is improving. BB&T is improving. I believe that will continue. If we have positive movement on the tax reform, which is most important, and infrastructure, to a secondary degree, I believe GDP will continue to improve. I know there\u2019s a lot of conversation about the waffling around in Washington. Who knows what will happen with regard to health care. But at the end of the day, it doesn\u2019t matter that much in terms of the GDP, but the tax reform and infrastructure spending is a big deal. We believe it will occur, and we believe it will have a big impact on our business and the industry in general. On Page 8, just a brief comment with regard to deposits. We believe we\u2019re having excellent deposit growth, and we\u2019re doing a really good job managing our cost of funds. Our noninterest-bearing deposits grew 11.6%, yet our total deposits declined about 2.8%. We\u2019re simply replacing more expensive, less core-oriented deposits with noninterest-bearing free deposits, and that seems like a rational thing to do. And frankly, we get a lot of stability out of the markets that we\u2019re in, particularly markets like Kentucky and West Virginia, et cetera. So you saw that the percentage of noninterest-bearing deposits increased again from 31.7% in the first quarter to 32.8%. And while it won\u2019t continue to increase at a rapid pace forever, that is still a very steady, nice increase. So before I turn it to Daryl, I just want to make three points. We are really, really focused on revenue growth. We \u2013 as I indicated, are putting a huge amount of effort in our core loan performance, loan performance on our core loan portfolios, and we have several other revenue strategies. In fact, we have five core revenue strategies that we start out every executive management meeting talking about. We\u2019re getting excellent execution on every one of those. We are focusing intensely on our margin. We believe we will continue to have low betas. The main reason for that is because we have a really solid core deposit base. Over the years, as we went into places like West Virginia and Kentucky and remain in places like Houston, North Carolina and South Georgia, these are very stable, rural markets, not as volatile, not as driven by national funding organizations that are prices don\u2019t push up as fast. So we believe we\u2019ll be able to serve our clients well because, in many cases, we\u2019re one of the few suppliers of banking services there. So they get excellent client service quality, but we just don\u2019t have to pay as higher interest rates, and we believe that will continue. Finally, with regard to expenses, we are laser-focused on expenses. We have a number of expense initiatives. We are using, for example, artificial intelligence, AI, robotics and moving across our backroom. Just to give you a flavor for that, Daryl did a really nice job earlier this year in taking just one project, one smaller project where we have in the accounting area, account reconciliation one person with a computer, one software reconciling account that took two hours. We put robotics on top of that. And in a virtual period of time, the new robotics software could do it in 15 minutes. So we now have six or seven more substantial projects that we are moving through to further improve the case, after which we will be going enterprise-wide in terms of finding ways to take these repetitious activities and apply good digitization and artificial intelligence to find more efficient and effective ways to reduce our cost. Finally, I would point out as an update that we told you early on that we expect to have a more aggressive posture with regard to branch closings. We\u2019ve said early on in January that we thought we\u2019d be north of 100, now revising that to north of 130. We\u2019ve simply done more work on it. And we\u2019re finding that we have a number of branches that are overlapping or in very close proximity to other branches that we can close. And our marginal profitability goes up meaningfully because we really don\u2019t lose any material business there, and our service quality remains good because our remaining open branches are very, very close. So that\u2019s just an overview of the most important things we\u2019re focusing on now. Let\u2019s let Daryl give you some more color. Daryl? Daryl Bible : Yes. Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I\u2019m going to talk about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, noninterest expense, capital, segment results and lastly, provide you guidance on the third quarter. Turning to Slide 9. We had a really strong quarter with regard to credit quality, which continues to show improvement. Net charge-offs totaled $132 million or 37 basis points, a decrease from 42 basis points last quarter. Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing decreased 9%. Loans 30 to 89 days past due increased $69 million or 8.6%, mostly due to expected seasonality in our consumer-related portfolios. NPAs were down 13.9% from last quarter, mostly due to the decline in nonperforming C&I and the residential mortgage loan sale, mostly of nonperforming loans and TDRs. Looking at the third quarter, we expect charge-offs to remain in a range of 35 to 45 basis points, assuming no unexpected deterioration in the economy. Given that NPAs are close to historical lows, we expect NPAs to remain about the same. Turning to Slide 10. Our allowance coverage ratios remain strong at 2.8 times for net charge-offs and 2.43 times for NPLs. The allowance-to-loan ratio was 1.03%, down slightly from last quarter. Excluding acquired portfolios, the allowance-to-loan ratio was 1.12%. So our effective allowance coverage remains strong. We received a provision of $135 million compared to net charge-offs of $132 million. Going forward, we expect loan loss provision to match charge-offs plus loan growth. Turning to Slide 11. Compared to last quarter, net interest margin was 3.47%, up 1 basis point. Core margin was 3.31%, up 3 basis points versus last quarter. Both GAAP margin and core margin benefited from short-term rate increases, partially offset by funding rate increases. The GAAP margin was also impacted by the runoff of purchase accounting. Asset sensitivity was relatively unchanged from the prior quarter. Given that we don\u2019t expect further rate increases this year, GAAP margin is expected to be down 1 to 3 basis points next quarter, while core margin is expected to be stable. Continuing on Slide 12. Our fee income improved to 42.7%. We attribute our 1.5% year-over-year improvement to positive results from the acquisitions we made and our team\u2019s success in implementing BB&T sales culture. Noninterest income totaled $1.2 billion, up $49 million compared to last quarter. Our fee income growth included an increase of $23 million in insurance income, mostly driven by seasonality in P&C commissions. Investment banking and brokerage and bank card and merchant both had strong quarters. Mortgage banking income was down from last quarter, primarily driven by lower net MSR income. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect fee income to increase 1% to 3% versus third quarter of last year. Keep in mind that insurance will be seasonally lower in the third quarter. Turning to Slide 13. Adjusted efficiency came in at 58.6%, down 1% from the same period last year. We are committed to improving our top-tier efficiency along with making right investments to generate revenue. Adjusted noninterest expenses totaled $1.7 billion, up $58 million from last quarter\u2019s adjusted expense number. Personnel expense increased $31 million, mostly due to the performance-based incentives and merit increases. Merger-related and restructuring charges decreased $26 million, largely due to prior quarter\u2019s write-off of software and write-down of real estate. Professional services expenses increased $16 million, offset by $10 million decrease in outside IT expenses, both related to BSA/AML efforts. In addition, other expense increased $16 million, mostly due to operating charge-offs, charitable donations and employee travel. Our FDIC costs are up minimally from last year due to the improvement in performance, which is offset by the increase in the FDIC surcharge. Going forward, expenses are expected to be stable to up 2% versus third quarter of last year, excluding merger-related and restructuring charges. We believe expenses will be well below $1.7 billion. We expect third quarter effective tax rate to be about 31%. Turning to Slide 14. Our capital and liquidity remained strong. We\u2019re very pleased to receive a non-objection to our capital plan. As a result, next week, we will seek board approval to increase our quarterly dividend to $0.33 per quarter. We received approval to repurchase $1.88 billion over the next four quarters. And our capital plan calls for us to repurchase $920 million in the third quarter. Common equity Tier 1 was 10.2% fully phased-in. LCR was 122%, and our liquid asset buffer was very strong at 13%. Now let\u2019s look at our segment results, beginning on Slide 15. Community Bank net income totaled $345 million, an increase of $5 million from last quarter and up $43 million from second quarter of last year. Net interest income increased $32 million from the first quarter and $99 million from second quarter of 2016. This is the best quarter of commercial production we\u2019ve seen, growing 25% year-over-year. This shows increased activity we\u2019re seeing on Main Street and the job our great bankers are doing in continuing to build quality relationships. Continuing on Slide 16. Residential Mortgage net income was $46 million, down from last quarter. Noninterest expense increased $4 million driven by higher regional production. Production mix was $68 million \u2013 or 68% purchase, 32% refi, and gain on sale margins were 1.61%, up from 1.01% last quarter. Looking at Slide 17. Dealer Financial Services net income totaled $38 million, up $9 million from last quarter. This is primarily due to the decline in provision for credit losses due to lower net charge-offs and prime auto and Regional Acceptance. As expected, net charge-offs and Regional Acceptance decreased to 6.5% this quarter. And our risk-adjusted yield was strong at 10%. Regional Acceptance 30 to 89 days past due were 6.6%, up from last quarter due to seasonality. Charge-offs for the prime portfolio remain excellent at 10 basis. Turning to Slide 18. Specialized Lending net income totaled $54 million, up $3 million from last quarter, primarily due to lower loss provision. We had strong year-over-year growth and production in premium finance and government finance. Additionally, year-over-year growth was strong in equipment finance in Grandbridge. Looking at Slide 19. Insurance Holdings net income totaled $55 million, up $9 million from last quarter. Noninterest income from the second quarter of last year reflects the timing of wholesale commission payments. Adjusting for the timing of these commissions, like-quarter organic growth was up approximately 1%. Noninterest expense totaled $396 million, up $7 million from last quarter, driven by higher personnel expense. Looking ahead to the third quarter, insurance income traditionally has the lowest revenue quarter of the year. Turning to Slide 20. Financial Services had $115 million in net income, up $23 million from last quarter. This was mostly due to higher investment banking, brokerage fees and commissions and improved funding spreads on deposits and increased loan volume. Corporate Banking had strong loan growth of 9.1%, while Wealth generated strong loan growth of 18.2% from last quarter. On Slide 21, I\u2019d like to summarize our outlook for the third quarter. We expect loan growth to be up 1% to 3% annualized versus second quarter. We expect to see faster core loan growth in the 5% to 7% range annualized. Our guidance for credit quality is about the same as last quarter. We expect net charge-offs to be in the 35 to 45 basis point range and NPAs to be relatively stable compared to second quarter. We expect GAAP margin to declined 1 to 3 basis points and linked quarter core margin to be flat compared to last quarter. Net interest income is also expected to be stable, similar to last quarter. We expect noninterest income to increase 1% to 3% versus third quarter of last year. Excluding merger and restructuring charges, expenses will be stable to up slightly, but below $1.7 billion versus third quarter of last year. Restructuring charges will include real estate charges as we rightsize our branch network. In summary, we had stronger earnings performance, good revenue growth, excellent credit quality, increasing core and GAAP margins and good expense growth for the quarter. Now let me turn it back over to Kelly for closing remarks and Q&A. Kelly King : Thanks, Daryl. So let me also provide my summary. As I said, I think it\u2019s a solid quarter, record revenue and earnings, good expense control and really much improved returns. We are having excellent execution on our key revenue strategies. We have improving and growing loan portfolios. We have excellent Specialized Lending performance, and our insurance business is doing very, very well. We are very energized about reconceptualizing our systems and processes through AI and robotics and other techniques. We are laser- focused on expense management. Main Street is alive, and we believe our best days are ahead. Alan Greer : Okay. Thank you, Kelly. Operator, at this time, if you could come back on the line and explain how our listeners may participate in the Q&A session Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question today from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: I was hoping to follow up on the outlook for the stable NIM on a GAAP basis. And I guess, specifically, why aren\u2019t we expecting or why shouldn\u2019t we expect some increase in the NIM, given the Fed hike in June and some of the optimization that you\u2019re doing both on the loan portfolio and deposit side? Daryl Bible : I think right now, Matt, we\u2019re forecasting our beta and deposits to be in the 20s from June rate increase, and there is opportunity that we might be able to be better than that. We have some contractual deposits and borrowings that will be priced up higher, which is kind of canceling out some of the core and GAAP margin from that perspective. In purchase accounting, it is somewhat predictable. In essence, it could be down 2 to 4 basis points. It really depends, and we\u2019re just trying to give you an estimate that we sure we can meet from that perspective. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then just a quick clarification on the expenses. What\u2019s the expense base that you\u2019re using from 3Q 2016 when you\u2019re saying flat to up 2%? Daryl Bible : Okay. So if you look at third quarter 2016, and you take out merger-related costs, it\u2019s $1,668,000,000 is what I have as core expenses for the third quarter of 2016. And we believe, as Kelly said, with our emphasis on expenses, we will be well below the $1.7 billion for third quarter of this year. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. Daryl Bible : Yes. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hey, good morning. Daryl Bible : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : So just to keep the conversation going, the well below $1.7 billion, can you just give us a sense as to the core run rate that you\u2019re looking for in the quarter you just did? And then when you say well below, is that really being driven primarily by the AML/BSA that you referenced in the prepared remarks, Kelly? Kelly King : I think it\u2019s the peaking out and defining of the BSA/AML, but it\u2019s also the other projects. Clip is our big commercial loan project that we\u2019ve been working on for last two years. We did that conversion July 2 or 3. It\u2019s gone extremely well largely, but that will be tailing off. And then, as I said, we\u2019re being more aggressive with regard to branch closings. I think right now, we\u2019ll be 130 plus in branch closings this year. And we are taking an enterprise-wide look, Betsy, at every area that we\u2019re doing business in. We believe we have been through eight years of having to deal with an extreme amount of micro management regulatory pressure. We believe that is lifting. And we are going to be focusing on how to run our business based on what makes sense to us. And so I\u2019m challenging everybody to go back and reconceptualize their business and, frankly, be prepared to run their businesses with less resources. Daryl Bible : Yes. So specifically, Betsy, I\u2019d say you should see decreases in personnel costs and occupancy costs, IT and professional costs and maybe other expenses will be the areas of focus over the next couple of quarters. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And so then based on the outlook that you gave for 3Q specifically, I know it\u2019s only one quarter forward look that you give, you\u2019re triangulating to positive operating leverage for us on a year-on-year basis. Is that \u2013 would that also be on a Q-on-Q basis, do you think? Or is that more flattish? Daryl Bible : I believe we have a good chance of getting it for a quarter-over-quarter basis, but definitely on a year-over-year, and we didn\u2019t quite make at this quarter, but we gave it our best shot. I think we have a good shot to get a quarter-over-quarter basis. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Great, thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Rose with Raymond James. Michael Rose : Hey, guys thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just a question on the portfolio optimization, I mean, what\u2019s really driving that? Is it concerns around any sort of credit issues as we move forward? And are there other areas that you might look to optimize in the next couple of quarters? Thanks. Kelly King : Well, Michael, let me give you a shot, and then I\u2019ll have Clarke to fill in. This is a big deal. There are no credit issues. Our current portfolio is clean as a whistle. We just have these two portfolios, about $30 billion in mortgages and about $10 billion in auto, that are sub-optimizing in terms of performance. And so in a rising rate environment, you don\u2019t exactly want to keep growing real fast your mortgage fixed rate portfolio, and I think everybody understands that. And the auto portfolio, we started 1.5 years so ago changing the nature of how we have our revenue-sharing arrangement with these dealers. We are an outlier in the industry, but it is a better, more consumer-friendly approach that we are taking. And so that\u2019s causing some of the loan rundown. But the other thing is that we are simply pricing up the assets. The market has driven down the pricing in auto to where it was just unacceptable returns. And so we said we are going to get our pricing to more acceptable returns, and we\u2019ll accept less volume. That\u2019s exactly what\u2019s occurring. So the profitability is not going down commensurate with the volumes. And so you\u2019ll see that all stabilize because we are continuing to add new dealers in the Northeast, et cetera, around the country with our model. And so it is not a \u2013 I mean, it is sub-optimized today. It is optimizing. Soon, the structure will be set for the future, and auto will begin to grow again, and mortgage will stabilize and probably slow a little bit again then grow again. Would you agree with that, Clarke? Clarke Starnes : Absolutely. Michael Rose : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe if you can just give, just switching gears, give some broad color and context on what you guys are seeing in the insurance business, the life and just generally what the expectations would be for that business as we move forward? Thanks. Chris Henson : Sure, this is Chris. We\u2019ve said in the past that rates pricing was down about 4%. We are beginning to see some stabilization of pricing. So the way I would characterize it is it\u2019s slowing at a slower pace. So instead of 4% down, you\u2019re probably seeing at something in the neighborhood of down 2.5%, 3%, which we think gives us the ability to, over time, potentially even by the end of the year, elevate our 1% core growth closer up to the 2% kind of category. And the things that were driving that, one, we have a disproportionate share of property. Property seems to have less pressure the last couple of quarters. We\u2019ve been in a down pricing market for 15 consecutive quarters. It normally runs about three years. So it\u2019s going to be down, but we think down less. Our current new business growth was \u2013 year-to-date, we\u2019re up 2.2%. Our current second quarter new business growth was up 8%. So we\u2019ve got really good momentum in growing faster than the market and offset the decline in pricing. And I think with respect to that, we also have some optimizing efforts in place. We\u2019ve got a couple cost initiatives that are, think of them as restructured ones in the EB business, and a real opportunity we\u2019ve gotten all the synergies out of our Swett & Crawford conversion. We\u2019ve converted in February, so we\u2019ve really been able since then to take advantage of that. So I think we told you we expected the improved margin. We think we\u2019ve got potential to improve the margin from 2016 to 2018 up 2% to 3%. We\u2019re kind of right in the middle of that, and that\u2019s going really well. Right. We finished the quarter at 22.5%. By the end of 2018, we\u2019d hope to be in the mid sort of 23% range. So we think there\u2019s opportunity there to expand profitability. And you mentioned life. Life is another bright spot because life companies really put out more capital when rates rise. In a rising rate environment, we have upward leverage in life insurance. And so year-to-date, our life insurance revenue is up 5.3%, which is a net helpful area for us. So all the core businesses, the BB&T Insurance Services, the McGriff on the retail side, and CRC on the \u2013 and Swett on the wholesale side, really are performing as expected or slightly better to date. So I would say, generally, it\u2019s much more positive momentum than we would have seen, say, two quarters ago, the margin expansion and general growth. Michael Rose : I appreciate the color. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to John McDonald with Bernstein. John McDonald : Hi, good morning. I was wondering about the capital, kind of optimal capital levels and how you\u2019re thinking about payout sustainability. You\u2019ve had a great CCAR and ramped up the payout to above 100% this cycle. Just wondering, when you look at the CET1 of 10%, north of 10% now, given your risk profile and size, it seems like that might be pretty high. Where do you think you could run it over time? Daryl Bible : So right now, with what we\u2019re doing in the third quarter, John, our CET1 ratio come down about 30 basis points, so we\u2019ll have about 10% CET1. As we continue with the repurchase, we may dip a little bit below 10%, but not much below, maybe 5.9% could be the lowest, depends on how much the balance sheet grows from all that. As the outlook goes out farther, I think it really depends on what happens in D.C. and regulatory. And from that perspective, if the industry allows ratios to come down more, we will follow to come down. If it doesn\u2019t, we\u2019re comfortable here. We believe we can get our return on equity over our cost of capital at the 10% level. We think with the leverage and growth that we\u2019re seeing on revenue and our expense actions that we\u2019re going to take, we\u2019ll be over 10% and moving higher than that from the next several years. John McDonald : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Daryl, just a ticky-tack item here, on the bank card fees had a big jump this quarter. You called out a reduction in the accrual for rewards. Is that a permanent change that pulls through, so this is kind of a new run rate on that revenue line? Or is that a one-timer? Daryl Bible : I would say it was probably $5 million or $6 million one-timer in there. It was some of our commercial card clients were not utilizing all their rewards, and we adjust the number. John McDonald : Got it. Okay. And then can you guys just comment, obviously, credit quality, very good across the board, talk about what you\u2019re seeing in auto and maybe just distinguish between the auto, sub-prime auto and what you\u2019re seeing in the prime? Clarke Starnes : John, this is Clarke. Just full disclosure, our total retail auto portfolio is about $13 billion. About $3.9 billion is sub-prime lending in Regional Acceptance. The other $9 billion is prime, as Kelly said before. The quality and the performance in the prime portfolio remains pristine. We had 10 basis points of loss year-over-year, flatness in delinquency. We\u2019re seeing no indication at all in the prime portfolio of any deterioration even with some of the concerns that certainly industry has around overcapacity and off-leased vehicles and those sort of things. But the profile of that portfolio is so clean. We just don\u2019t see any real issues. We never did any 84 month. We have a conservative advanced rate. So the prime portfolio, I\u2019m extremely comfortable with. We are also cautiously optimistic about our results with Regional Acceptance. They had nice seasonal improvement. For the third quarter, their losses were $649 million versus $598 million common quarter. And if you look at \u2013 while we don\u2019t know what our full year forecast will be, we think it will be around 8% or less, and that\u2019s not up much from last year. So we\u2019re starting to see stabilization in our pools based upon underwriting changes we started two years ago. But we think that this, when we put it in there and we\u2019ve moderated the growth rate, that we\u2019ll continue to perform well. And as Daryl said, our risk-adjusted yield, even after losses, is north of 10% in that portfolio. John McDonald : Great. Okay, thanks, Clarke. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Kelly King : Good morning. Erika Najarian : My first question is just a clarification to Betsy\u2019s line of questioning. Kelly, you mentioned that expenses were peaking during your opening remarks. And I\u2019m wondering, as we look beyond this year and into 2018, do you mean that they\u2019re peaking in the specific categories that Daryl mentioned when he was answering Betsy\u2019s question and that\u2019s related to compliance and BSA? Or are you talking about expenses peaking generally for the franchise? Kelly King : I\u2019m talking about peaking generally for the franchise for two different reasons. The ones that Daryl referred to are peaking because the projects are moving through completion status, and that includes our general ledger and our commercial loan system, our new data center and then there will be BSA, and all of those kind of project-related. The other is we\u2019re rationalizing the cost structure in our branch network. That\u2019s a tailwind for us in terms of controlling expenses in the branch network. And then broadly across the company, as I indicated earlier, we believe there\u2019s an opportunity to get all of our expense structures more efficient as we move from the last eight years of intense regulatory pressure to where we believe we\u2019re going to have a more reasonable regulatory environment going forward. And that is going to give us the opportunity to take a fresh look at all of the things we do across the organization and find better ways to do what we do, find ways to eliminate things that we\u2019re doing that we don\u2019t really need to do. We\u2019re going to go \u2013 we\u2019re going to basically go back to the future. We\u2019re going to go back and run the bank the way we think it ought to be run and eliminate all of the nonessential stuff that\u2019s been added during this period of time. Erika Najarian : Got it. Just a follow-up question. A lot of your peers have been asked about what the potential impact would be on deposit growth and then subsequently, deposit betas if \u2013 as the Fed starts reducing their balance sheet. Given your commentary that you are the bank of Main Street, I\u2019m wondering, is it fair for us to conclude that your wholesale or non-retail deposits could possibly be less sensitive to attrition in the event of a Fed balance sheet reduction? Kelly King : Absolutely. Fed balance sheet restructuring has nothing to do with Main Street. It has nothing to do with BB&T. Erika Najarian : Great, thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Good morning. Kelly King : Good morning. John Pancari : I wanted to get a little bit more detail on the loan growth outlook and what you\u2019re seeing there in terms of trends and demand. I mean, when you look at the loan growth, Kelly, in your comments, you sounded optimistic. You indicated that there\u2019s improving optimism at mid-market and small business and activity there. And you\u2019ve come in at the high end of your guidance now for a couple of quarters around the 3% annualized range. So why the 1% to 3% range? Why not guide to the higher end of that or give us a little bit of color? Is there anything that\u2019s keeping you at that 1% to 3% range firmly? Kelly King : No, John. The only thing is you know us, we tend to be kind of conservative. In fact, the most recent information I got last night would suggest to me that the 3% would be more like a reasonable number. But you guys ask us to hang guidances out there, and then you come back and hang us if we miss it. So we tend to want to be a little conservative. And you got some \u2013 yes, I get that. We love you for it. So yes, your evaluation would be accurate. Everything we\u2019re seeing in terms of commentary from the client, this is I\u2019m getting from talking to our lenders. I\u2019m getting it from talking to the business people. I\u2019ve had 23 lunches where I\u2019m sitting and talking to six to eight business people over the last few months. I\u2019ve gotten this across our entire footprint. I\u2019ve got a pretty good feel what the clients are directly saying. I\u2019ve got a really good feel of what our production people are saying. And I\u2019ve got a good feel for what the actual pipeline shows. All of that is very, very positive. And can I guarantee that all the craziness in Washington will not derail that? No. But I\u2019ll be honest with you as I\u2019ve talked to business people out there, they\u2019re not worried about all this craziness going on in Washington. They\u2019re just focusing on growing their business. Now I will say I think they are expecting a tax reduction deal and, to a lesser degree, they\u2019re counting on infrastructure. But if we get the tax reduction deal, they\u2019ll continue. So what they\u2019re doing today is what I call replenishment investment. So for 8 years, they\u2019ve not been investing. They\u2019re driving trucks for 300,000 miles, they\u2019re using 20-year-old equipment. They kind of got to do something or shut their business down. The changes of late have given them a level of optimism causing them to go ahead and do different replenishment investment. Then if we get tax reform, I believe we\u2019ll go into an expansion investment where they\u2019ll be able to grow their plant, add more trucks and add more associates. And so I think that most likely is we\u2019ve been pretty conservative, and we\u2019ll see next quarter how a prognosticator I am. John Pancari : Okay. All right, thanks, Kelly. And then on the expense front, regarding the BSA/AML commentary you had, I know you indicated about 90% of the work is done, and you expect the cost could begin to abate in the back half of this year. Have you \u2013 can you help us quantify the run rate of those costs, the amount of them and then separately, the timing, any type of guesstimate around when you could be out of this consent order? Kelly King : Let me give you a general comment. So we\u2019ve spent about over $80 million this year in terms of developing this program. As I said, we\u2019re about through with that. Now a lot of the $80 million is just the consultants and all of the work of building the program. That will kind of go away, but then you do have to run the program that you just built. That won\u2019t go away. So for example, if I had to guess right this minute, I\u2019d say of the $80 million, $50 million to $60 million will stay and $20 million to $30 million will go. It\u2019s hard to know exactly because we have to evaluate the responses from the regulators, et cetera, but it\u2019s very expensive to build these programs, whether it\u2019s a commercial loan system or AML/BSA programs. They\u2019re expansion to build takes a lot of consulting expense, takes a lot of our time. All that is going away. So I think that you would definitely see it peaking and going down. I think it will be going down at a major, consistent pace over the next 4, 5 quarters, and then you\u2019ll find the new norm. John Pancari : Okay, got it. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Marty Mosby : Thanks. I have a couple of questions, a little different process. Daryl, when you talk about deposits and deposits actually declining, you talked about retail and commercial are still growing, but public funds was really the driver of that, is that a shift in the way that liquidity requirements don\u2019t give much credit for those types of deposits? Or is that just a different way of looking at it? Daryl Bible : Marty, when we look at public deposits, and we\u2019ve been in the business for a long time, but as we rationalize, like we\u2019re doing on the asset side of the balance sheet, we\u2019re also rationalizing the other side of the balance sheet. And a lot of times, when you negotiate and deal with the public funds, you pay them really attractive interest rates and you also bit of a lot, really discount your fees or whatever. So we\u2019re just going through a rationalization of who makes sense from a funding perspective. So I really wouldn\u2019t be concerned of losing any of those deposits. We also lost some contractual deposits, non-client, also this quarter if you look at our end-of-period numbers. But Kelly said, all of our core retail and commercial clients are staying with us and growing very nicely. These are just on the edges as we just rationalize and optimize the balance sheet. Kelly King : And so Marty, you just need to think about the public funds balances largely as a substitute for other forms of short term, non-core funding. And we move those around just like we do short-term funding. And the good news is our core fundings are going really, really well. And the fact that we can let some of the others run down is just a real positive story, not a negative story. Marty Mosby : Yes, I was more looking at the collateral, the price you pay, everything is really just more expensive than other sources of funding that you can get on the market. So with no liquidity, good will, anything coming from it from a liquidity standpoint, then I thought that was an optimization that was probably going on, on that front as well. Daryl Bible : You\u2019re absolutely right, Marty. We have to price collateral, we charge the business lines for that collateral of those deposits, and it\u2019s a real cost, especially when you\u2019re using HQLA 1 type security. Marlin Mosby : When we look at \u2013 you\u2019re buying back about half of your shares then you just got approved. Is that because you generally envision your stock price moving up over the year? I mean, what\u2019s the \u2013 you said even as soon as possible. What is the thought process when you are doing much more accelerated than across the year evenly? Kelly King : So Marty, the reason is, number one, we have the excess capital today. We don\u2019t need it, and we think returning it to the shareholders as quick as possible makes sense. I\u2019m certainly never going to own these cost project what our stock price is going to do, but I\u2019m quite happy to do an accelerated repurchase of these funds at their current prices. Marlin Mosby : Just to know if that gave you a bias. And then going to AML/BSA, just a real kind of side curveball here. Two things with this. The bank has spent so much time, effort and money on AML/BSA. And yet, behind the scenes, we now have Bitcoin emerging, which is not regulated. So I mean, are we spending so much money on this to just push all the activity to where it\u2019s not even going to be able to be looked at, at all? So is there any real productivity from this? And then the second part of the question is, are you getting other things besides just satisfying the regulation out of this $80 million that you spent? I mean, is there some business things that you can do better because you spent this money? So overall, is there a return rather than just checking a box from the consent order? Kelly King : Well, Marty, I would say, don\u2019t make the mistake of trying to apply your really well-developed sense of logic and rationality to this whole area of what we\u2019re doing and everybody else is doing with regard to this. If you and I ran the whole country with regard to this, we\u2019d figure out a dramatically more efficient way to deal with this, but that\u2019s something we obviously can\u2019t control. So yes, we\u2019re doing exactly what the regulators tell us to do. And we get some benefit, yes, because the system we\u2019re developing is better. It will allow us \u2013 I mean, one of the things, while you\u2019re looking for tariffs, you\u2019re also looking for fraudulent type of transactions. And your system being made more efficient, I think Clarke will get to some lift with regard to that. Clarke Starnes : Absolutely. We \u2013 Marty, we\u2019ve added a new very comprehensive commercial lending screening process as part of this that we do get value out of, so that is a positive. Marlin Mosby : Perfect. Thank you all so much. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning, guys. Kelly King : Good morning. Gerard Cassidy : A question I had \u2013 and I apologize if you addressed this earlier, I had to jump off the call for a minute. When you look at the treasury\u2019s proposals that they came out with about a month ago about some of the regulatory changes that they suggest should happen, they had to identify a couple of them that would benefit BB&T than most. Can you tell us what those would be? Kelly King : Yes, so I think what Secretary Mnuchin came out with is a really, really good blueprint of kind of what the regulators ought to be moving towards. And I would say, Gerard, the most important thing is what most people don\u2019t focus on. The most important thing he basically said is we ought to kind of let the banks run the banks, and we need to get the regulators out of micromanaging, I\u2019m paraphrasing, but micromanaging the banks. There are enormous benefits for us and everybody else when we move down that road because we have just added in so many micromanagement types of processes and systems that have been required that are not productive, that I think the Secretary understands as a former banker. And as a smart person, I think he understands that is ineffective for the banking system, and I think he understands it\u2019s hurting the banking system and is, therefore, hurting the economy. So the biggest thing, in general, that if they can \u2013 if they will follow through, the regulators will follow through and remove themselves from micromanaging the banks, get back to where it\u2019s always been for most of my career where they looked at the most important issues like capital adequacy and profitability and liquidity and the thing that regulators always look at. And I think if we go down that road, this could be substantially more profitable for us. The other thing that he focused on, which is really important, is it will allow the banks to improve lending. One \u2013 if you know that the \u2013 everybody tends to ask why is the economy not running more than 1.5%, 2% the last eight years. It\u2019s not surprising. It\u2019s mathematical. I mean, when you go through and you dramatically increase the capital, you dramatically increase the liquidity and you dramatically change the cost pressure of the bank so that they take money away from trying to grow loans into [indiscernible], you get less loan growth. And so \u2013 and that not only affects the banks, but it affects the businesses. The businesses out there have not been willing to borrow because, and I\u2019ve said this on many, many of these calls, when you talk to them over these last eight years, they have said I\u2019m not going to borrow a nickel because of taxes, regulation, Obamacare, et cetera, et cetera. And so number one, the businesses \u2013 remember, they\u2019re dealing with regulatory bodies beyond us, think EEOC, DOL, EPA, et cetera, et cetera, all of those agencies have been putting undue pressure on those businesses. So when it all whitens up, you\u2019ll see the businesses more willing to borrow, you\u2019ll see the banks have more capacity to lend and you\u2019ll see the banks more able to lend because we have more time to lend because we\u2019re doing less minutia. The other thing I would point out \u2013 yes, Gerard, just one other point, in case you don\u2019t know this, this is incredible. So mortgage lending. Mortgage lending is a whopping big part of our economy because housing construction is a big part of our economy. Mortgage drives the housing market. And the mortgage processing business has been decimated by all the changes that have been made. When I started in banking in 1972, I could have made you a mortgage with 8 or 10 pages, and you do understood what we were doing. And now we\u2019ve got \u2013 the average mortgage out there is 615 pages, and the more complex ones go up to 800. And Secretary Mnuchin gets that. So if we can get the CFPB to understand how damaging this is to the economy and particularly young borrowers out there, they need the bank\u2019s help. And they\u2019re making this so cumbersome, so expensive, banks can\u2019t afford to make $100,000 to $125,000 loan for a young couple to get their first house. So what he is doing is trying to help the banks improve lending, which will improve the economy. Gerard Cassidy : Kelly, as a follow-up, obviously, you\u2019ve been through a few cycles with the bank on credit. Can you compare this \u2013 credit, obviously, for your organization and others is very strong. Can you compare it to other parts of the cycles when you go back to maybe the late 70s or following the 1990 banking debacle we ran into? What do you compare this period to in your career? Chris Henson : I think, Gerard, this is a relatively stable period. It\u2019s not a period like the early 90s when we had a really boom in commercial real estate. It\u2019s not a period like 2007 and 2008 where we had a really booming residential mortgages. There are a few little things that bother me out there, like a mode of family kind of got out of hand for a while, but it\u2019s been jacked back in. So I would call it, today, the loan portfolios in general and the banking system are really good, and I would say about as good as I\u2019ve seen it in any of the cycles in my career. I will say to the extent that there are any excesses being built up in the system. It is yet once again out in the shadow system. And the banks are doing a heck of a good job in general in managing our portfolio, but we can\u2019t do anything about controlling what happens otherwise. But I don\u2019t think, Gerard, as you read going forward, I don\u2019t think, by the way, that the shadow system is of such today that we are heading into a major recession because of anything like 2007 or 2008. I\u2019m just saying the tendencies of that system or they don\u2019t operate as prudently as the banking system. They don\u2019t have the controls and they don\u2019t have the capital requirements and liquidity requirements that we have. And so naturally, they drift to where they can make loans that are less well-structured and less well-priced because they got lower capital and less liquidity and less regulatory expenses, and so they create excess capital that causes excesses in certain areas that get built that shouldn\u2019t get built. But specifically, I\u2019m proud to say, I think, overall, the banking system today is in really good shape. Gerard Cassidy : I appreciate instance, Kelly. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we\u2019ll take our final question today from Christopher Marinac with FIG Partners. Christopher Marinac : Kelly, as a couple of quarters passed, and you have more visibility on cost controls and being able to execute some of the points you made earlier on the call, what does this mean for M&A that you may look at? Does this create new opportunities because you can grab greater cost efficiencies? Kelly King : I was wondering, Christopher, if we will get through this call without somebody asking about M&A. I was wondering. So yes, so to the extent that we are able to figure out how to operate more efficiently, that factor causes M&A to be more attractive because you can bring in less efficient organizations into a more efficient platform. That increases the economics and the desirability. On the other hand \u2013 and that the whole scale thing is still a really big driver of M&A. That\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing a lot of M&A today in the smaller institutions, and they\u2019re seeing it. I mean, they have no choice. It\u2019s true, the larger size is just more complex. So the scale is a big issue, will continue to be a big issue, and finding ways to reconceptualize the business and become more efficient will improve across banks of M&A. On the other hand, as I\u2019ve mentioned, there are some other factors that cause M&A to not be as attractive. I mean, we \u2013 if you have large retail networks out of market prospects, they would not be as attractive to us today as they would have been 10 years ago because when you do an end-market deal, they\u2019re still very attractive because you can monetize the net present value of the branches immediately. When you buy an out of market where you don\u2019t have the overlap, you are buying the risk of what is the net present value or the stream of earnings of those branches, and nobody knows the answer to that except this will be less with digitalization. So we will be looking, as we go forward, whenever we get back in M&A business, we are not today, I\u2019m not releasing our pause, but I would say it\u2019s not as far away as it has been in place. When we look at it, we will be very eager to look at end-market opportunities, and out-of-market opportunities will have to be looked at more carefully. Christopher Marinac : Great, Kelly. Thank you for the background. That\u2019s appreciated. Operator : Alan, I\u2019ll turn it back to you for closing remarks. Alan Greer : Okay. Thank you, Debbie, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. If you have further questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to contact Investor Relations. This concludes our call. We hope you have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today\u2019s conference, and you may now disconnect.",

Hope you're having a great day and thanks for joining call. So, we had a solid third quarter with growth in revenues that despite the hurricanes which as you know impacted a meaningful part of our market. We did have growth in core loans and we had very good expense control and net income available to common shareholders totaled $597 million, diluted EPS was $0.74 up $1.04 versus third quarter 2016. But, if you adjust for the four penny effect because of merger-related and researcher charges, it would be an adjusted $0.78, which is up 2.6% versus third quarter 2016. Our adjusted and return on assets, return on common equity and return on tangible common equity were 1.2, 9.2 and 15.6, which I think are very respectable performance ratios in this environment. Positively, we did have adjusted positive operating leverage which we were very pleased with. Taxable revenues totaled $2.9 billion, which is up $1.04 versus the third quarter and that was led primarily by a good core loan growth and we did have the [benefits] [ph] and higher rates. Net interest margin increased 1 basis point to 348 as did our core net interest margin and we are pleased about that. Adjusted efficiency ratio improved to 58.3 from 58.6, if you recall early on the year, we talked about our -- our cost began to kind of peak in the middle part of the year and begin to kind of common down that proving out as we hope to it was. Non-interest expenses excluding merger-related restructuring charges totaled $1.698 billion and that was notably a decrease of 7.8% annualized versus the second quarter. Our point of view, we are spending a lot of time on reconceptualization around all aspects of our business; it's the new world, simply many of the old methods and strategies don't work any more. So, we are continuing, but on a more aggressive pace, our reconceptualization strategy around all aspects of the business, so if you are seeing and you will expect to continue to see meaningful changes that will result in FTE reductions and have positive expense impact going forward. Still on Page 3, our non-performing assets climbed 1.4%, our net charge-offs declined to 35 apart from giving more detail, if you like it, the truth is we are just having great credit quality. We did increase our quarterly dividend 10%, $0.33 completed a 920 million in share repurchases and our common equity ratio is still a strong 10.1%, so good return on capital to our shareholder. If you look at Slide 4, we just had just one merger related restructuring charges of 47 million, $0.04 a share after-tax, almost all of those are restructuring cost including severance accruals and facility charges related to branch closings. We closed 61 branches in the third quarter. We project at a high probability level closing about 78 in the fourth quarter, so we will have closed about 140 branches for this year. This will of course produce positive run rate savings as we go forward and we would expect to continue to look aggressively at our branch distribution system next year and I will relate to that again in just a moment. If you look at Page 5, we started recently just trying to give you a little report card in terms of our performance versus guidance. With regard to loans, we did miss as we indicated at a mid-year conference, what really happened was there was a huge spike in pay-offs in August, if you recall there was a meaningful reduction in the tenure and that just drove a lot of people to go ahead and refinance, so that drove our pay-offs up, which frankly we didn't see the time we did our last earnings call and I don't know that almost anybody did. And we did have some slower production due to hurricanes not a dramatic impact, but some particularly in Florida where our power was out anywhere from 10, 12, 13 days, for lots of people across the entire state. Obviously, when power is out, and trees are down people are back on taking care of their family versus that the bank making loans. So, we lost some production, we think we will get that back, but we did have some of that impact. Credit quality of asset was just impeccably good, our net interest margin, we did hit our guidance there, we were actually up a little bit of basis point in each area. Net interest income was stable. Non-interest income, we did have a slight miss, but that was primarily because of lower performance commission coming out of the hurricane effect, if you want more detail on that Chris is certainly available talk about that. But, basically the immediate impact of storms, yes, we have lower performance commission, we tend to get that back reasonably soon as rate suggest, but that did have some impact on this quarter -- we've had a nice quarter probably. And we did lose some insurance production during the hurricane as well because again some people just didn't have power [indiscernible]. We think we will get that back but that was a diluted impact. Expenses were inline with our guidance and we felt good about that. If you look at Page 6, as I said we had solid loan growth, I notice was a little bit messy but let me try to hit and see what we did. So, if you look, you will see that our total loans were down 1.1% annualized, but our sub-total for commercial is up 1.2, I will point out that there is a reclass -- a one-time reclass between C&I and CRE, RPP coming out of our reset commercial loan system conversion. So, basically what that meant was we shifted some loans out of C&I to CRE, but this is basically loans that are like to think about investment grade drug store, investment grade grocery with [land] [ph], we tended to call that RPP, we think it's RPP, but this system also wants to call it CRE. So, this was not a change in quality, it's just a shift in that. So, the best way to look at is to put that together, we had commercial growth of 1.2. We had some very strong growth in a number of our categories, premium finance was up 34% annualized, Sheffield up 19% annualized, finance up 15%. And so, we think that those particular segment and categories we have are doing very, very well. Just a little more color on the loan portfolio. If you look at the next page, we have been trying to break out four year to help you understand we are fully growing on our business. It can look -- it can look and also good if you just look at the decline of 1.1%. But, if you look at our core portfolios, we are growing 3.8% and as I said, commercial is growing when you make that adjustment. So, we feel good about that and then our core season portfolios have grown 28%. So, we are getting our core business are growing but simply focusing on these strategies which we have for the last two or three quarters to improve the long-term profitability by adjusting some of these optimizing portfolios. So, in terms of key strategy, we continue to focus on growing more profitable loans that are better risk return, what that means is, that we are growing C&I, we are growing, deferred the level of CRE. We are pricing prime auto at a level which are through profitability and returns. Frankly, their market to guidance so over delivered the returns were just low and so we just want to book of assets to generate total low returns for our shareholders. So, we are adjusting that and that's causing some volume reduction. But, that's okay because our relative profitability is going up. We continue to sell most of our confirming residential mortgages, while we are meeting all the needs of our clients because we are booking all of them we just are selling most of the confirming because we still think the most likely the rate rise and we don't want to hold-off huge amount of mortgages at this time. We continue to focus again on sales finance, so sales finance, we give you perspective decrease [$60 million to $70 million] [ph] or 25%, so that's a material impact in before run, residential decreased 6.3% in the short run. Now, with regard to our expectations, going forward we think core loans are expected to grow 2% to 4% annualized in the fourth, so our basic core business is doing well, not great but well in this environment. Our prime holder and prime residential, I'm pleased to say we expect to take a lot of them in the first half of 2018. So, you begin to see our total loan growth begin to move up as we head through 2018 because of those optimizing portfolios haven't gotten into where we want them to be. So, total loans will decline slightly end of fourth, but good solid growth in the core portfolios. Look, it is a very challenging market out there, it is important from a long-term point of view to stay focused on quality and profitability attempting to have faster loan growth in the short run that is a fools game and we want to grow all the good loans from our clients that are well priced and well structured that we can and we are not going to try to improve short-term earnings by making bad loans. I have been around 45 years, I have seen things, thanks to that many, many times, it's not like a strategy, we are not going to do it. Still I would say to you that we are turning EBITDA we can, so we have a number of special strategies, run our specialized lending businesses, our core corporate portfolio is growing very, very well and a number of things that Clarke and our [many] working on to enhance performance and we think we can, but this will be in a context proper quality and profitability. Recent acquisitions, I will say you are beginning to gain traction, they are not nearly where they need to be but they term to occur every time we do a merger we know that you go through a 18 to 24 months period of time that takes you to kind of stabilize and begin to grow we have been through, stabilization period is beginning to grow so that's good news and they were good benefits as we go forward. Quick look at deposits on Page 8, I feel pretty good about this while our core deposits are down 7% that is totally about plan. Our non-interest bearing deposits of our plan are up 6.9% which is very, very good. We are beginning to see interest rates move up a bit particularly in commercial. We have been holding our betas pretty tight, we will probably give up a little bit of that as we go forward, Daryl will talk about that in his report and so, we will begin to see that. That will correspond as we go along during the year, but loan growth and so that will be appropriate. Importantly our non-interest deposits did increase again from 32.8% of deposits to 34% which is really important from a long-term point of view. So, just before I turn it to Daryl, just a couple of strategic comments. We have this call every quarter, every quarter we spend a lot of time talking about what happened to the every little detail and income of the balance sheet on this quarter. And that's fine, we have to answer questions about it. But, it's not the most important thing for us to talk about. Most important thing for us to talk about is what's going on in the world, what's going on, end of people going on in terms of our strategies and I would just say to you that look world has changed and if we need to be, and we are focusing on every aspect of our business to make sure that we are benefiting the old times strategies and processes that don't work and reinvesting in strategies and processes that didn't work, recognized in the new environment. For example, we are tightly focused on strategies that where we can differentiate. It makes more sense in the world today to focus on a strategy you can differentiate on, unless you are the biggest player in town where you can have really low prices and based on huge scale. And of course, that's not what we are, we are focused on differentiation, where we can operate with an inelastic demand curve meaning by differentiation we can get a meaningful price improvement that of course of the differentiation of the -- that's a whopping big deal conceptually and we are spending a lot of time on that. We have these areas that we really can't differentiate unlike our middle market commercial, our small business are well, our insurance, our specialized lending business, we are focusing more and more and more time on those and frankly spending relative less time on other areas where we can't get the differentiated advantage. We are spending a lot of time on digital AR and all the investors we need to make to be an aggressive player in the new world to play to the excess wires millennials et cetera and we are focusing to rationalize on branch networks that's been paid for conceptually by focusing on this branch conceptualization network strategy. We are able to return some of that to the shareholders and we are able to invest substantially and the new strategies of the future which are really important in terms of growing the franchise as we go forward. We believe we are assembled to going forward, the winners are going to be the once that have solid strategies but have excellent execution. That's exactly what we are focused on. Now, I will turn it to Daryl for some more commentary. Daryl Bible : Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today I'm going to talk about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, non-interest expense capital; our segment results and provide some guidance for the fourth quarter. Turning to Slide 9, we had a really strong quarter with regard to improved charge offs and non-performing assets. Net charge offs totaled 127 million or 35 basis points, it decreased from 37 basis points last quarter. Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing increased 2.4% versus last quarter. This is mainly due to government guaranteed residential mortgages. Loans 30 to 89 days past due increased 113 million or 12.9% mostly due to seasonality and hurricane related impacts. NPAs were down $10 million or 1.4% from last quarter mostly due to improvement in the commercial portfolio. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect net charge offs to be in a range of 40 to 50 basis points assuming no unexpected deterioration in the economy. The slight increase in the expected net charge off range is due to seasonality. Continuing on Slide 10, our allowance coverage ratio remain strong at 2.93x for net charge offs and 2.44x for MPLs. The allowance to loans ratio was 1.04% up slightly from last quarter. The allowance includes 35 million qualitative adjustment for the stores. Excluding the acquired portfolio, the allowance to loans ratio was 1.12x unchanged from last quarter. So our effective allowance coverage ratios remain strong. Third quarter provision of $126 million compared to net charge offs of $127 million. Going forward, we expect loan loss provision to net charge offs plus longer. Turning to Slide 11. Compared to last quarter net interest margin was 3.48% up 1 basis point. Core margin was 3.32% also up 1 basis point from last quarter. GAAP and core margin benefited from higher loan yields partially offset from funding rate increases. Deposit betas continue to be very modest exceeding our expectations. Asset sensitivity was unchanged from the prior quarter. GAAP and core margin both expected to be down 3 to 5 basis points next quarter due to higher funding cost and asset mix changes. Continuing on Slide 12. Our fee income ratio was 41.4% down from last quarter mostly due to seasonality and insurance. Non-interest income totaled $1.12 billion down $54 million compared to last quarter. Both mortgage banking and other income had nice increases from last quarter. Other income was up due to private equity investments which is partially offset in minority interest. A primary driver for the decrease in non-interest income was lower insurance income. It was down $84 million mostly driven by seasonality and lower performance based commissions. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect fee income to be up slightly versus the fourth quarter of last year. Turning to Slide 13. Adjusted non-interest expense was slightly under $1.7 billion down $34 million from last quarter's adjusted expense number. Personnel expense decreased $18 million mostly due to lower benefit expense and lower production-based incentives. While we had a modest drop in personnel this quarter, we expect the much larger reduction in salary expense to show up in future quarters. Merger-related and restructuring charges increased $37 million mostly due to facility charges and severance. The professional services expense decreased $11 million primarily from lower AML expenses. Going forward expenses are expected to be stable versus fourth quarter of last year excluding merger-related and restructuring charges, which equates to $1.65 billion for next quarter. We will achieve positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter for growth like and linked quarters. We expect fourth quarter effective tax rate to be about 31%. Continuing on Slide 14. Our capital and liquidity remained strong. Common equity tier 1 was 10.1%; we are very pleased with this quarter with the third quarter payouts. Dividend payout ratio was 44% and our total payout ratio was 198% reflecting $920 million in share repurchases. The remainder of our proved $1.88 billion of share repurchases are expected to incur evenly through the next three quarters. Now let's look at our segment results beginning on Slide 15. Community Bank net income was $396 million an increase of $51 million from last quarter. Net interest income increased $24 million from the second quarter mostly due to positive performance in deposit betas. Loan production was disrupted in part by hurricanes well down since were impacted by larger pay-offs. We had a good increase in our commercial pipeline which was 15.4% from the end of last quarter. As you can see we closed 70 branches through the third quarter we are planning to close as Kelly said about 78 this quarter. Turning to Slide 16. Residential mortgage banking net income was $67 million up $21 million from last quarter. Non-interest income increased $14 million driven by increased gains in the sale of residential mortgages. Production mix was 70% purchased and 30% refi relatively stable compared to the second quarter. And our gain on sale margin was 1.85% versus 1.61% last quarter. Continuing on Slide 17. Dealer financial services net income totaled $38 million unchanged from last quarter. Net charge-offs and regional acceptance set a slight year-over-year increase to 7.5%. Net charge-offs for prime portfolio remained excellent at 18 basis points. Turning to Slide 18. Specialized lending net income totaled $54 million unchanged from last quarter. Compared to second quarter we had a strong loan growth in premium finance, Sheffield and equipment finance. Turning to Slide 19. Insurance holdings net income totaled $13 million down $42 million from last quarter. Non-interest income totaled $399 million down $84 million; this was driven by seasonality as well as lower performance-based commissions. The fourth quarter fee income guidance includes lower expected performance-based commissions like-quarter organic growth was down 28% mostly due to timing of renewals and storm-related losses. Non-interest expense totaled $378 million down $18 million from last quarter driven by seasonally lower incentives. Continuing on Slide 20. Financial services had a $106 million in net income down $9 million from last quarter. Fee income was up due to private equity investments, corporate banking has strong loan growth of 8.4% while wealth generated strong loan growth of 18.2% from last quarter. A decline in deposits was mostly due to managed run off a larger balanced rate sensitive deposits. On Slide 21, you will see our outlook for the fourth quarter. While we continue investing in our businesses to drive improved revenue growth, we feel very confident that non-interest expenses will continue to decline and we will strive to have positive operating leveraging. In summary, we had solid third quarter earnings, positive adjusted operating leverage, decline net charge-offs and non-performers and increase to the GAAP and core margins and good expense control for the quarter. Now let me turn it back over to Kelly for closing remarks and Q&A. Kelly King : Thanks Daryl. So very good Daryl it was a solid quarter take on a challenging environment, our revenues grew we had good core loans and growth, we had good core deposit growth, we have excellent expense control. We have a lot of focus on the future, focusing on our branch - rationalizing, our strategy, our digital strategy and most importantly we continue to be tightly focused on our vision mission and values. At BB&T we clearly believe our best days are ahead. Alan Greer : Okay. Thank you, Kelly. At this time, we'll begin our Q&A session, and we would ask our operator alone to come back on the line and explain how our listeners may participate. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Nancy your line is open please go ahead. Nancy Bush : Good morning Kelly, how are you? Kelly King : Hi, Nancy. How are you? Nancy Bush : Good. In this differentiation that you are talking about and in this rethinking of the franchise what has been the biggest emphasis to this, I mean when you are thinking about the factors that are out there right now, what really plays into this? Kelly King : So Nancy, I think it's, its broadly speaking is that the, world is changing frankly a lot faster than I would have four, five years ago, is largely around, the whole digitalization, artificial intelligence, robotics, all of which are allowing us in the back room to restructure and, frankly we can robotize many, many processes that were manually handled forever. And we get that quality and more efficiency. So the back room offers, really prefers them in my career offers huge opportunities to recentralize and do the same with less expense. In the front room as you know the world has changed in terms of their expectations of convenience banking and is not just Xs and Ys in the many years although they are the most strategically focused on it, but everybody who just have very, very high quality mobile banking et cetera. So that is where we are having a spend an enormous amount of focus on being sure that we have the best offerings in terms of digitized delivery of services think mobile banking and et cetera and be able to do it in a efficient way. So in order to pay for all of the front room, we are rationalized in the back room and we rationalize in the branch structure. So it's, simple way to answer and I think about is just, you actually wrote to our commentary about some time ago, the world if really changed and so, we are thinking about every aspect of our business that we are today, than we were three years ago, two years ago. Nancy Bush : Did this that thought process include and we just saw JPM by WePay doesn't include, the bringing in fintech franchises, have you thought that for ahead is that something and that would be attractive to you? Kelly King : Absolutely, we have for 18 months, you may have heard how we wanted first to have one of our executive officers as our Chief Digital Officer. He is full time focused on scouting the role figuring out what the best fintech offerings are, looking for opportunities to buy partner loan from we are just completely open minded about how we can integrate the advanced technique to fintech brought to the world. So, the answer is clearly yes. Nancy Bush : And I would just ask as the final part of this, in looking at the banking franchise and rationalizing the banking franchise is it possible, I mean you guys have spend decades now building a franchise is it possible that you will look at regions to exit? Kelly King : In today's world Nancy, everything is possible. So, well we think about that is we first frankly focusing on, pardon me, we are first focusing on what I call residual business and that we have that, don't really make sense because of not that we might not be making money, but we just can't make much money. So we get as I mean those kind of strategies recall they won't be tightly focused on the ones that do make sense. In terms of regions, in terms of the market outreach, as I sit here I don't have any particular regions that I would say we are in that we don't want to be in. But, the clear thought process that I will be focusing is, de-emphasizing regions that don't offer as much opportunity and improving our profitability. Now that may ultimately lead to your point lead to actually exiting, but right now our focus is on improving profitability in those regions that don't offer substantial growth, but do offer good solid relationships today, we were focusing on providing still good, always quality, but because we have such huge brand value there, we think we can provide this solid service quality value with less expense. And then reinvesting those expenses and the market instead our higher growth markets and offer more long-term potential. Nancy Bush : Thank you. Kelly King : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi good morning. Kelly King : Hi Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi good morning. Kelly King : Good morning. Daryl Bible : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : I just want to focus in on the loan growth opportunities here, because I know that you are looking for the core portfolio to be growing in the 2% to 4% range or so, yet in the near term it's going to come in below that because of the run-off portfolios which feel like they are going to be done running off in 1Q, 2Q next year. But maybe if you can give us a sense as to that piece of change and what's the issues in the run-off portfolio that you really want them to be moving off as oppose to sticking with them in this low growthish environment? And then maybe highlight where you see opportunities in your regions for accelerating loan growth? Thanks. Kelly King : Betsy, I'll take a start and then Clarke can add some detail. So we are really focusing on, as you how to say optimizing these the mortgage portfolio and the prime portfolio there is no surprising those portfolios are now generating adequate returns on equity and in terms of when you think mortgage in terms of rising rates, now we are about to have auto where we wanted to be, I mean the business we're going to stay in, but this would be and not chasing volume, but chasing margins and profitability that's heading towards stabilization, mortgages heading towards stabilization just a natural run-off. So, you are right first half that being, they would be where they want to be. But really the more important thing it doesn't really come through I think in our numbers is that we have really good traction in a lot of areas. Our corporate banking strategy is growing extremely well, strong double-digit growth and has a good long runway. Because, as you know we weren't natural player in the big, the high-end market until the last few years, we have a fantastic team in that area and it is doing really well and we'll continue to do well going forward. Our growth strategy is really hitting in all cylinders in terms of fees and asset generation is doing extremely well, all of our specialized lending businesses are doing fantastic. I mean you grow in double, you grow in 20%, 24%, 25% growth rate and as seasonal somewhat, but I mean still they are doing extremely well and we are differentiating it, so I don't worry about it comparative prices much on that. The biggest challenge is in the community bank, where we are competing with everybody in the world, but what we are doing there is focusing on, the quality service delivery, but also frankly differentiation. We are in the midst of rolling out today in our community bank a very, very exciting a quality differentiating approach which is around what we call financial insights. And what that it is rather than going to decline, so I'm talking about loans and deposits, we go and talking to them about how we can help them grow their businesses, we try to get clear about what their goals and strategies are going forward. So that we can better augment their performance by support them. For example, we, I believe the only bank out there that through our BB&T leadership institute that goes into companies and talks to them about how to help their companies for better by having better leadership talent and we have, a very, very long history of providing excellent executive leadership training that we bring to our clients. And they really appreciate that, they appreciate if that we don't come in day one and ask for a loan, but the positive is we come in and talk about how can we help them grow their business, how can we help them their individuals grow and that's got really, really good attraction. The number of all those Betsy that we are focusing on is well so, I wouldn't want you or others to think that, we got a decline in loans and that's the whole story that's not the story at all. The decline in loans is simply a smart profitability strategy of restructuring our portfolios that don't make as much sense and reinvesting more time and energy in ones that do. And we think that forms in those areas are very strong. Betsy Graseck : Okay, thanks. Very helpful answer. I appreciate it Kelly. Kelly King : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt your line is open. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. Kelly King : Hi Matt. Matt O'Connor: I was hoping you could elaborate on the insurance performance-based commissions, how much of the insurance fees, does that represent what are drivers and what's the outlook? Chris Henson : Yes. Happy to do that Matt, this is Chris. First thing I would maybe point out that, I think that there might be some mistake about the inline performance. We come off our second quarter which is our highest quarter of the year to our lowest which is in the third, when you call out that $84 million reduction about $56 million of that is seasonality about $9 million was just directly related to hurricane losses due to performance-based commissions, three was like Kelly said was just production loss, facilities are really shutdown, so we couldn't do business. And there is about $16 million related to timing through various businesses where we might have received something in the second quarter of this year, we received in the first quarter in the year's prior. So just to clear that on seasonality, but the outlook I think it's a great question that the storms do cause a reduction in performance-based commissions in the short-term, but we get improvement over the intermediate term. So, really over the long-term this is good for brokers, you have to go through this wonder of short-term paying to really get pricing up to the long-term. I think what you could expect from us in fourth quarter is commission is being up around the 5% level and that includes in the reductions we would have in performance-based commissions. We still see economic expansion driving our unit growth, this quarter we had 5% new business growth, when you drive insurance one is pricing and its stabilized down from 4 and to say the 2 to 3 range and we have the opportunity now through storms for pricing to actually improve further. Second, it would be client retention and we're industry leading at 91%, 92% or so there. So economic expansion, I think is one pricing new business growth we commented on. But to your point that outlook on performance-based commission this is really too early impact, you can't get the impact, the recent catastrophes, we focus on hurricanes there have been four of those, but you also have the Mexican earthquake, you've got the wildfires in California. So, given there is lots of capital in the market, today the industry is in transition as it relates to all this. Of offsets, the most that I read range up to $150 billion plus by the way. Most of what you read is, if you, if it exceeds a 100 and its going to put capital pressure on the industry side, I think it is likely to causing pricing increase as going forward. Obviously depends on levels of new capital coming and I think we will likely see some sort of price increase. We've also got the impact of standard cares and support to retail market that really freeze pricing after the storms and what they really trying to wait on so see what the reinsurers do which is a price reset at the first of the year. So, I think that also will likely drop pricing out for carriers. Matt O'Connor: Okay that's helpful. And then if I could just squeeze in on a follow-up on expenses, I know there was a comment about hoping to continue to push cost down obviously fourth quarter, the ability on does you think about 2018 any early thoughts on can you reduce cost on absolute basis, are you trying to offset kind of inflationary pressures, what are the thoughts on the expert plan heading into next year? Daryl Bible : Yes Matt, this is Daryl. We are still putting together our 2018 plan. I think the best way I can tell you right now is what Kelly said is that we are continuing to look forward our efficiencies and kind of redistribution of our cost structure and you will continue to see the salary line item and more severance payments which will drive our personnel cost down for the next couple of quarters. We're going to use that into 2018, we are going to give guidance on 2018 yet, but no that we have pretty much wind in our sales right now from an expense basis because its headed down right now and well we're going to make investments in our company, we still have a pretty good trajectory down. Matt O'Connor: Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from John McDonald with Bernstein. John McDonald : Good morning, Daryl, I was hoping to ask just a little bit about the NII outlook and net interest margin on. For the net interest margin down 3 to 5 basis points next quarter, can you give a little details on the funding cost and asset mix pressures that you referenced? Daryl Bible : Yes, I think we made a decision John to grow our investment securities portfolio, over the next quarter or two consistent with what we think we're going to see loan growth over the next year or two. So our securities portfolio is going to ramp up a little bit kind of close to what it was a year or so ago. So, consistent with maybe three plus percent that's basically given us a negative asset mix change, but gives us positive net interest income, a contribution from that perspective. And then from a deposit beta perspective if you look at the last four rate increases, our deposit beta has been about 14% today on interest bearing deposits. We continue to respond and, be a aggressive on the commercial side as we need to and I think retail side is still pretty tame though we are starting to have a couple competition more for wealth clients and all that. So we're trying to be responsive, but I think over the next couple of rate increases you are going to see that 14% start to drift up probably back to normal levels you had, but closer to higher levels than where they are today. John McDonald : Okay, and the change in mindset about the securities is driven more about the loan growth and challenges of loan growth rather than a rate outlook change or anything like that it sounds like? Daryl Bible : Yes, I don't think we're smart enough to know exactly which way rates are going to go, but alone that the shape of the curve and you have adverse as long and all that, I think we just want to keep our portfolio approximately 20 plus percent of our balance sheet, from a liquidity perspective. We're really gearing up to have pretty solid loan growth into 2018 and we just want to make sure we have liquidity, so we want to make sure that we're funded with our core clients, we have been liquidity with our securities portfolio as our important loan portfolio starts to take-off. John McDonald : Okay. And then just on the fourth quarter outlook for net charge-offs, so can you remind us what portfolios see that seasonal up tick in the fourth quarter and also is that charge-off guidance the 40 or 50 include any hurricane impact on charge-offs that you might expect for the fourth quarter? Clarke Starnes : Yes. John, this is Clarke. Primary seasonality impact in the fourth is always going to be in our retail portfolios, but more specifically its Regional Acceptance or some problem or wind or so while we are not expecting any increase in deterioration it would be the normal year-over-year seasonality that's the biggest impact, but also just to remind you, well we had extremely low third quarter number in our commercial losses and we're just forecasting maybe a little more normal losses, hopefully we'll do better, but those are the two primary factors. John McDonald : Okay, got it. Thank you. Clarke Starnes : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning guys. Kelly King : Good morning, how are you doing? Gerard Cassidy : Kelly, can you give us a little more color you talked about looking over the long-term and not necessarily the short term when it comes to loan growth and some of the things that you folks are seeing in the marketplace on underwriting. What are you seeing that makes you little nervous especially at this point the cycle and can you bring that by loan category whether its CRE or commercial or consumer? Kelly King : Yes. Gerard, I think the mega issue here is that you know we've been on a nine year slow economy. Asset returns for all investors have declined steadily that's driven the profitability down and so everybody is scrambling for profitability which means they are scrambling for assets and is invariable happens as you know when people are scrambling for assets and there is a lot of people scrambling then you get declines in prices and you get, stretching in terms of term. So, the mega issue is we did a lot of pricing and to two level of underwriting, two longer terms not special covenants et cetera. I think that's generally occurring across the board, it was more specific and, like more to family although we would tell you that as improved two years ago, 18 months ago we've heard about that, but I think everybody is going to rationalize that down a bit more, little more rationale. And so, I don't think that there is any one particular area that we were, there is a little bit of a spike in story facilities, fee links like that, but nothing that's dramatic, and Clarke would you add anything to that. Clarke Starnes : I would just add to what Kelly said, on the corporate side to our generally probably the most rationale, but what we see its time to continue to get a mandatory, to deliver the mandates for the syndication or loosening covenants, reducing the number of covenants, dispose federal structural weaknesses that we know in the long-term, you got to be careful on, I think we see the most hyper competition in the small regional community bank winning space which is again a lot of structural consideration give ups and little pricing for that's probably the most hyper compared to and your third point, I think you'll had to always look at is not all growth is per saying, so I think everyone in the slow environment is trying to find a little niche or something to get it growth that they are not highly experienced into kind of the herbs chasing some of these new forms of lending to have it being tested yet and that's underneath the lot of these numbers. So, we're just trying to be mindful of all those issues. Gerard Cassidy : Could you guys equate this period to 2005 or is that, or is too aggressive back then when you think back about it? Kelly King : I think it was too aggressive back then. Then you had a much less informed, you for around chasing bubbles. And you know we have a much more inflated level of bubbles throughout all asset classes. So this is nothing like 2005 and 2006, but totally in the real estate category. So, I personally think anything impressive we would make about lending today should not suggest, we think its way out of control and its leading to recession and all of that not at all. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then on the deposit side, obviously you guys are very clearly about taking down the interest bearing deposits and you grew your non-interest bearing obviously quite well. Aside from the betas that you've already touched on, was there something else in the interest bearing that prompted you to kind of take them down the way you did this quarter? Daryl Bible : Yes. Gerard, it was basically just lower funding play, we had some deposit that was close to LIBOR flat that was indexed to market rates, and we just made a decision to basically fund them for federal more bank advances which was sub-LIBOR probably by 10 or 15 basis points. So it's just an economic decision, when you are being paid LIBOR flat that's really not a, I would call core client, they are very, very sensitive from that perspective. So we didn't lose any core clients, it was just a economic decision. Gerard Cassidy : Great, thank you. Daryl Bible : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Yes, hi good morning. Kelly King : Good morning. Daryl Bible : Good morning. Erika Najarian : My first question Kelly is on maybe asking further little bit more detailed and how you are thinking about the branch reduction strategy for 2018 and 2019? And, as you think about your distribution channel, do you think that could naturally lower the efficiency ratio all those being equal from the 58% that you've been, booking all year? Kelly King : Yes. So conceptually, we're going through cannibal process and the, the first phase of the process is looking at kind of what we call the life free that's where you have, in the market you may have 15 and 20 branches on this one particular street you have three branches all that are within 5 or 6 miles each other. So you close the one in the middle, you move the associates to the, of the two and it doesn't really change and your expenses go down. So that's what we've been doing kind of this year, as we head into 2018 and 2019 then what we have to do is think in terms of eliminating the branches but being assured that we are investing properly in the other areas, other forms of distribution so for example you might see us there closing branches but adding free standing ATMs or you might see us closing branches but adding ATMs and drug stores or Wal-Marts or places like that, because while most of the declines still go to the branches for more complex products, I'll now for a lot I feel just making a deposit in cash and checks, as we go through 2018, 2019 it will be a little more complex, but still a plenty of opportunity it just may require a bit more add back not terribly expensive add back in terms of the way to meet the convenience needs of the client. In terms of the efficiency ratio all of those to get will improve our efficiency ratio, because we're simply able to reduce expenses and have relatively small negative impact in terms of income. So, everyone that we closed improves our efficiency. Clarke Starnes : The other thing I would add with that Erika is as we are closing branches what we have found is our retention rates are really, really high in the high 90s. So, we are maintaining the almost 100% of clients in revenue and deposits that from the closed branches. So, I think there has been really little impact on revenue or core deposits. Erika Najarian : That's really helpful. Thank you. And the follow-up to that is, so essentially you are telling investors is the value of the branch and changing world has declined, how should we think about this relative to the strategy in terms of how BB&T grow up. So, in terms of you had been community bank roll up story, so as we think about potential other roll ups going forward does that mean your less likely to do them or does that simply mean that the natural cause savings going forward from here is it completely differently and maybe higher math than we had seen in the past? Kelly King : So Erika, that's a very good question, I have addressed that in a couple of conferences. So it does make a material change and here is how. So historically, when we acquired an institution you could very reasonably mathematically project the future cash flows from the projected operations of a branch discount those cash flow and back them figure out what paid for and it makes sense, because the projected cash flow is relatively constant and in many cases it's growing. Now as we look at a bank acquisition, we have to be thoughtful about the future cash flows of those branches going down, because in the last two or three years especially the level of branch activity has been going down for us and everybody else though we have been 6 and in some cases higher percentage of lower activity three year. And so what that means is if you are looking, an out of market acquisition where you're going to keep the branches it doesn't mean it's not valuable, but it means is meaningfully less valuable, because when you look forward the predictability the cash flow is less and you are sure will be a decline in cash flow. And so you have factor that in, so you would be discounting back a lower projected cash flow with more volatility and so necessarily you pay less of that. For all of that means and as it's said the value of out of market acquisition for somebody like us doesn't make any sense. There is a price you do it, it may have a price that [fell when they expect] [ph]. End market hasn't changed the reason for that is because you got the same factors with regard to the changes in the future projected cash flows of those branches. But, in an end market where you have dramatic overlap you do, what I call effectively monetizing the value of that branch by closing it immediately and drawing those lines over to other branches and to other forms of digital interaction and so you cut the expenses, you don't have the revenue which can do that out of market you got the branches you just got off your relationship with the client. End market you got the expenses just like -- it's just exactly what we are doing in terms of rightsizing our branch size, it's the same concept when you are doing end market merger. And so we would continue to have a strong appetite for end market M&A. We have it release our own internal pause, you have to be putting in place back 2.5 year, but I would tell you we are very, very close to releasing that -- we basically have moved through the period we were concerned about in terms of the major projects and somebody in Pennsylvania and so forth. So, we are pretty close to either left release a pause. In terms of M&A, there is the issue with the BSA, issue, we are in the bottom half of the [8, so the top half of the 9] [ph], top half of the [9] [ph], on average we feel very good about where we are, we expect, and we have done all that we need to do in terms of changing and assessing the processes. We are just working with our regulator in terms of their evaluation of that. And while, I cannot promise anything, I'm optimistic that in the not too distant future, we will be removed from that order and have capability of just paying back in the M&A again. I want to be very clear, however, that is now signal BB&T is getting ready to go out on some big rampage of M&A. As the M&A strategies I just described is very different than what it was few years ago. We are very conservative. There will be some partners who would be interested in doing business with, where it's good for everybody that we are most focused on our shareholders and we are simply not going to do to lose a deal. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Good morning. Kelly King : Good morning, John. John Pancari : On that -- just going back to the M&A topic, can you just remind us though -- in terms of bank versus non-bank acquisition interest and would you be interested in ensuring some properties if they come about or you're not looking when they are growing that inorganically anywhere? Thanks. Kelly King : We are very interested in insurance acquisitions today we are not prohibitive regarding insurance acquisitions and we are open for business as you will. And very interested into an insurance acquisition today. We like to think of our insurance business and Chris can give you more color if you want. We would like to ideally keep it at about [2010] [ph] revenues, we are about 17% that's why we have room to expand there. And there are good opportunities out therefore. We would consider other non-bank acquisitions, but to be honest other than insurance, I don't really see that happening. People talk about asset acquisition businesses. Most of the times now we don't work in those and so we are -- I would say we are currently tightly focused on insurance. The single -- any small things and by the payment business we look at but they are not meaningful in terms of moving the numbers. And then, we reopen the bank acquisition opportunities I just described to Erika. John Pancari : Great and that's helpful. And just remind me on the bank side, what will be your suite spot again in terms of target asset size, if you were to do whole bank deals? Kelly King : I think, the suite spot would be 20 plus billion. John Pancari : Okay. All right. Thanks guys. And then, separately back to the competition discussion, I know you flagged it a few times here in terms of where you are seeing that pressure particularly on the lending side. Can you talk a little bit about what that means for -- your loan yield here borrowing any incremental moves from the fed? How do you think the competition could weigh on loan pricing and how that could play out in terms of your loan yield as we look in the out quarters? Thanks. Chris Henson : As we said, it's highly competitive out there. So, this quarter we did see some compression and the new loan spreads not material. So we have been doing a really good job despite the competition of generally holding up our spread although they continue to be pressured comparatively -- a wrong yield was actually up as we benefited from the rate increases and as Kelly laid out very well earlier in the presentation, mixed strategies around better pricing schemes for things like our indirect auto, the business that we get out of some of the subs which have higher margin. So, we think those help to offset some of those competitive pressures. But, it is a real challenge as we look forward and we fairly don't want to comment on\u2026 Daryl Bible : The only thing I would add to that John is, you have to look -- so, we are optimizing mortgage and auto. When you look at the spreads like for example auto is big chunk of the book was put on as spread that was a little over 100 basis points or at 120 basis points. We now optimize that the spreads are not close to 200 basis points. So as those old ones renewal and roll over that's going to give us some left. As Clarke said, there is competition in specific C&I credit, whatever, but if you point it all together, I think our credit spreads are still hanging in there pretty well because of our optimization efforts that we have there. And rate sensitivity wise, we are about -- very still up or the short end is about 2/3rds going in, it is our net interest income come up at the -- curve actually even and then shifts, we will also benefit from that. So, it really just depends what the rate outlook is. John Pancari : Got it. All right. Thanks Daryl. Operator : And our final question comes from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Kevin Barker : Thank you. Good morning. Kelly King : Hey, good morning. Kevin Barker : So, you obviously talked about M&A quite a bit here and you are looking at that as a longer term strategy, you have to deal with consent or first but taking the other side of it, there has been an increased talk of the Sify buffer potentially moving into $250 billion or going to some type of quality approach. Given then, you are a little bit over $220 billion in assets right now, have you ever considered staying below $250 billion in assets in order to not have to deal with possibly the liquidity coverage ratio or having more flexibility with your capital ratio. Kelly King : So, Kevin, I -- first of all, the value of the $250 billion is very much in slice, there are a number of conceptually proposals and converse the ensuing bill et cetera, it's not at all clear, what's going to happen with regard to the value is at $250 million. What's most likely getting ready to happen is, I'm going to eliminate the hard ones when the fed is reshuffle in terms with their board of governors. I think they are going to eliminate the hard full 50, 250 and unless they can go away and banks that will be gauged based on the weighted average assessment of their risk. And so, if that happens, it's actually for us given that our weighted average category of risk, but relative to some of the biggest banks, we could be $400 billion, $500 billion and still not be just be a Sify or require a huge amounts of excessive regulation. So, we will see how that plays out. But, independent of that, as we look at the next deal, it's already, this is close to $250 billion, if that's still the existing rule, we will be mindful of exactly how we do that deal. But, look here is the thing Kevin, for us sit back here now and say that we are not going to go over $250 billion because there are some things that we have to deal with -- would be redeeming ourselves a long player. In this business, you are growing or you are dying and we are a growth company and robust right $250 billion, when the appropriate time comes we will be real happy about it. Kevin Barker : Okay. And then, when you think that you talked about this and it has but some of the expenses as you build up or some of the investment that you made in order to prepare for the $250 billion in assets. At what point, as far as the investments, how far long do you think you are in preparation for a $250 billion? Daryl Bible : It really depends on what happens to the rose Kevin. I would say that we are hopeful that the advanced approach kind of fans away when Governor Tarullo was in office. He was not a fan of the advanced approach. We believe that will continue on, but we really need to see and hear that from the new board of governors. That would be one big expense you can take off the table. As far as the capital, the OCI market that's just something that we would manage and I think we were very comfortable managing that with our held to maturity portfolio. OCR and got talked about that in the past, I think with the combination of our core deposits and our current liquidity coupled with usage of letters of credit from the home loan bank, we can minimize that cost, so until we significantly. So, there are couple of other things, but as Kelly said, we will grow over $250 billion. We will -- you pay us to manage our business and do it effectively and we will minimize the cost as much as possible. We don't see anything prohibitive there. Kevin Barker : Okay. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : At this time, I would like to turn things back to Alan Greer for any additional or closing remarks. Alan Greer : Okay. Thank you, Laura. This concludes our call for today. Hope everyone has a great day. If you have further questions, please don't hesitate to contact Investor Relations. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Good morning, everybody and thank you for joining us on our call. We had a really strong quarter, record adjusted net income available to shareholders, which was very balanced led by record revenues, good expense controls, stellar asset quality and really good growth in core loans. If you look at some of the numbers on page 3, you will see that net income available to common shareholders totaled 614 million, which was up 3.7% versus the fourth quarter \u201916, but adjusted net income because of a number of changes, which we\u2019ll cover with you, was a record 671 million, up 11.5% versus like quarter. Diluted EPS totaled $0.77, up 6.9% versus fourth quarter, but adjusted EPS totaled $0.84, which was up a strong 15.1% versus the fourth quarter.  If you look at full year, our adjusted EPS was $3.14, which was up 9.4% compared to an adjusted EPS for last year. Our returns were very strong. So if you look at the adjusted ROA, ROCE and ROTCE respectively, they were 1.29%, 9.93% and a very strong 16.7% on return on tangible. We\u2019re very pleased we had a positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis for both like and linked quarter.  We had taxable equivalent revenues totaling 2.9 billion, which was up 5%. That was a function really of good core loan growth and non-interest income. Our linked quarter revenues were up 7.4%, which reflected strong insurance, which is somewhat seasonal, typically seasonal and other fee business income. Now, net interest margin did decrease 5 basis points as expected. Our core margin decreased 4 basis points, all again as expected. Recall that our actual, absolute margins are still relatively high, some of the highest in the peer group. Our fee income ratio was 42.7%, up 41.4%, so it continues to be very, very strong. Our GAAP efficiency ratio was 64.7%, but importantly, our adjusted efficiency ratio improved to 57.2% from 58.3% in the third and I would point out that's the best adjusted efficiency ratio we've had in three years. So we've been saying that we have plateaued and we'll begin to see our efficiency ratio come down, that is in fact materializing. Also, I would point out that our adjusted non-interest expenses totaled 1.697 billion, which was a decrease of 0.2% annualized versus the third quarter. Not a huge decrease, but a decrease, so, a turn as we\u2019ve indicated.  Credit quality was fantastic. NPAs declined another 7.8% from a very, very low level. Charge-offs were 36 basis points versus 35 in the third quarter and 42 on a like quarter, so a really nice improvement in credit quality. We did complete 371 million in share repurchase and we did do a 53 million all de minimis purchase, which is allowed under CCAR. If you're tracking in the deck and on page four, we just wanted to share some of the detail in terms of some of the changes we made with regard to the tax reform benefit. You probably saw we did increase our charitable contribution by 100 million on pretax, which will be invested over time into our communities. We did reevaluate our deferred income taxes, investments in affordable housing projects. That was a plus $43 million on a tax basis.  We did do one-time bonuses for associates, which we were happy about, which was 36 million pretax or 23 million aftertax. We did have a total of -- therefore the net impact of tax reform items of 43 million aftertax, which is $0.05 a share dilutive to our GAAP number. Our merger related and restructuring charges was 14 million, which is $0.02. So, if you look at that $0.07, that our earnings per share was diluted because of the tax changes and the restructuring charges that reoccurred during that quarter. If you look at page 5, just kind of a bigger chart, but that\u2019s just ahead of you, if you want to dig into these changes, you can very easily see how the personnel expense and the merger related charges and revaluations and the donations, all figured in just fine, I\u2019m explaining how you got from $0.77 to $0.84 from our perspective.  If you look at page 6, I would just point out we had a really good performance relative to our data. We get checkmarks in all the areas. We were particularly pleased with our credit quality, which was 36 basis points, below our range of 40 to 50. Our margin was as we expected. Net income, net interest income was down a little bit. We have said stable, so that\u2019s actually in that category. Non-interest income was kind of a nice improvement. We\u2019ve said it will be up slightly and so 5.4%. And again, we did -- I say, we would expect to achieve positive operating leverage and we did. So, we felt good about the guidances that we had given. If you look at page 7, in terms of our loan growth, I\u2019d call it strong core loan growth. You know over the last year, we've had to explain away the fact that we\u2019ve been making long-term strategic changes in a couple of our key portfolios, auto and mortgage. It was the right thing to do. But the good news is, it is nearing an end. So if you look at that slide, you'll see that our subtotal commercial was up. And let me point out that these numbers you're seeing do represent some changes we made in terms of our loan presentation to better reflect our business, primarily between commercial and retail.  I don't think it's too confusing, but if you want details, there's a map in the appendix that shows you exactly how these items map over. But essentially, it\u2019s basically just clarifying all commercial as commercial and all retail as retail and I think that will be cleaner for you as we go forward. But as I indicated earlier, we had strong core long growth of 3.9% versus the third quarter. We\u2019ve had some very strong individual areas, like, commercial leases were up 27.3% annualized; dealer floor plan up 22.9%, government finance, up 17% and revolving credit, up 13.5%.  So, we did have a decline in retail of 4.6% annualized, but again that was by design. I would point out that we are nearing the end of this optimization process. We expect retail runoff to begin to stabilize and grow in the first quarter from -- primarily from the mortgage area. And in the second quarter, we expect the auto portfolio to turn. So, kind of by the end of the first half, we\u2019ll be clearly growing both of our portfolios and then our blended average will be somewhere between the first and second quarter. But the main thing is the pain of most of that is over. And as we go forward over the rest of this year and into next year, you will see our loan growth, I think, meaningfully increase, because of that painful process we needed to go through, but good process from a long term strategic point of view. If you look at page 8, I just point out that DDA continues to do great, growing 5.9%. Our percentage of DDA to total deposits was up 34.4 from 34. I\u2019ll just remind you that if you go back over about last 15 year, our DDA has gone up from about 14% to 15% to 34%, growing from the last end of the peer group to top. So, huge improvement in our balance sheet restructuring over these years in the product category and the loan category, all of that has taken a lot of work, but has worked out very, very well. I would point out that our betas in deposit are low at 15% on interest deposits and 8% on total deposits.  A lot of speculation about what\u2019s going to happen going forward, my own view is that betas will go up, but they will go slowly until and unless loan growth really takes off. But the fact is industry and we don't need to substantially raise prices on deposits until and unless loan growth will take off. We think there will be some increase in loan growth, but to expect betas to dramatically increase in the short term, I think would be inappropriate. I want to take a minute now and cover a couple of key strategic issues to me that are more important than all the detailed numbers. So \u201917, as I just described was a very strong year. However it was a strong year in the midst of some substantial headwinds that I want you to understand. First of all, Main Street where we participate primarily was still slow. It is improving, but it was still slow.  Our Pennsylvania investment, if you recall, we invested over the last couple of years about $30 billion in assets, they are great long term investments, but in all these mergers and I have done a lot of them over my career, it takes about two years, two-and-a-half years to go through the restructuring process, we were still right in the middle of that in 2017. They are improving dramatically, but they were still a drag in \u201917. Our loan portfolio optimization was a drag. Our major IT investments as we finished up AFSVision, our Zebulon data center was a drag. Our BSA program was a drag, which is by the way [indiscernible].  So if you look at all five of those, they were pretty substantial and to have the kind of returns we had, dealing with those key strategic changes that that we needed to work through is pretty spectacular. Now, the good news is, as you look in to \u201918, all of those five headwinds in \u201917 become tailwinds in \u201918. So, Main Street is getting better, Pennsylvania is getting substantially down and productivity is up high percentages, bond portfolio optimization is basically over. The IT investments are basically over. The BSA program, in terms of investment expenses, is basically over.  So, that\u2019s really, really good. Also, I would point out that you \u2013 I mentioned that we had some changes in our accounting presentation with regard to our loan portfolio. The backdrop of that is we are really doubling down on our community bank, we think, Main Street is coming back. It\u2019s time to get substantially more performance out of the community bank. So we are taking another of our top level executive and asking him to run the retail part of the community bank, Brant Standridge and leaving David Weaver to focus totally on the commercial side.  So, while we've had a good performance in community bank, the time is right to really substantiate in that point of the community bank, because it's getting ready to really take off, given the changes in the marketplace. So that's a pretty big deal and you will see our retail performance improve substantially as we go forward, not just the optimization portfolios reversing, but also the emphasis on new products and new strategies and new execution focuses that will come out of those changes.  I\u2019d also point out we continue to have more emphasis on all of our national lending businesses, our corporate business, our leasing businesses, particularly around our equipment, our auto portfolio. As I\u2019ve said, we're changing, but we're also expanding it more broadly across the country. Our mortgage portfolio, we're expanding in a lot of new markets and other places in terms of our brokerage business around the country. Our wealth business continues to grow and we invest substantially more assets in that.  Simultaneously, we continue to invest substantially more in our digital strategy. Our new platform continues to be one of the very best in the business today. We continue to invest in it on a regular basis. Our Zelle P2P program, like all of the other major banks in the country rolled out recently, it's going extraordinarily well. We have and we will continue to substantially increase our investment in marketing, around our digital presentation to the marketplace. That's a big deal.  We are in the midst of rolling out what we call voice of the client, which is a major way of tracking the client as they tiptoe through our company from area to area. We get feedback on a consistent basis whether they are on the client care center, in the branches or wherever they're visiting us, we get feedback so that we can respond to any challenges that they have. A big deal, we are doing a major substantial restructure in our IT area, around dev ops, AI, robotics, all of the areas that will make that whole area substantially more effective and frankly less expensive.  As you saw last year, we closed about 150 branches, we\u2019ll close another 150 or so this year. We do have a pretty big opportunity to continue to rationalize our branch structure. We've still got a lot of small branches in a lot of rural areas and we're being much more aggressive in terms of rationalizing that structure. You can expect to see that continue for a number of years. And then finally, I would point out that the economy we believe is going to be better. The global economy is better. This tax change will flow through and will have a big impact on the economy. We get constant clear feedback that the market leaders out there, the CEOs have dramatically increased their level of confidence and optimism. We are seeing activity in terms of them investing in the businesses, so the economy is going to be better in \u201918 and further we believe. And then finally, I\u2019d point out that we, in addition to all that, we are tightly focused on organic growth. Over the years, we\u2019ve spent a lot of time with regard to mergers. I\u2019m not ruling mergers out entirely. We still are on our path. We haven\u2019t officially listed out, but it kind of doesn't matter. We are tightly focused on organic growth. We're not focused on mergers and we're getting really, really good benefits from that. And in addition to doing all of that, we [indiscernible] and so that shows you that we're doing what we said. We are re-conceptualizing our business. We're disrupting our businesses. We're preparing for the future and we're very excited about the future. In fact, we believe 2018 will be a very strong year for our company. So let me turn it to Daryl now to give you some more detail on the performance areas. Daryl Bible : Thank you, Kelly and good morning to everyone today. I\u2019m going to talk about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, non-interest expense, capital or segment results and provide some guidance for first quarter and full year 2018. Turning to slide 9, credit quality exceeded our expectations and continues to look very strong across the board. Net charge-offs totaled 130 million or 36 basis points, up 1 basis point, but down 42 basis points from fourth quarter 2016. The slight increase is due to expected seasonality. When excluding government guaranteed and PCI loans, loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing were 5 basis points of loans and leases, flat versus last quarter. Loans, 30 to 89 days past due, increased 65 million or 6.6% mostly due to expected seasonality. NPAs were down 53 million or 7.8% from last quarter, mostly due to the improvement in C&I loans and foreclosed properties. At 28 basis points of total assets, the NPA ratio has not been this low since the third quarter 2006. Continuing on slide 10, our allowance coverage ratio remains strong at 2.89 times for net charge-offs and 2.62 times for NPAs. The allowance to loans ratio was 1.04%, unchanged from last quarter. Excluding the acquired portfolio, the allowance to loans ratio was 1.11%, down 1 basis points from last quarter. So our effective allowance coverage ratios remain strong. We recorded a provision of 138 million compared to net charge-offs of 130 million. Turning to slide 11, the reported net interest margin was 3.43%, down 5 points. Core margin was 3.28%, down 4 basis points. The decline in GAAP and core margin reflects a 2.1 billion increase in securities, lower security yields due to duration adjustments and spread compression between loan yields and product costs. GAAP margin also includes expected reduction in purchase accounting benefit. Deposit betas continue to be very modest, with most of the increase coming from commercial deposits. Asset sensitivity declined slightly due to an increase in fixed rate assets. Continuing on slide 12, our fee income ratio was 42.7%, up mostly due to seasonality in insurance. Non-interest income totaled 1.2 billion, or 59 million. There was a broad based increase in the quarter, including commission based fees, which impacted personnel costs that we would talk about shortly. Insurance income was up 21 million, mostly driven by seasonality. Investment banking and brokerage had a strong quarter, up 8 million. The increase of other income reflected another strong quarter for private equity investments of 13 million. Turning to slide 13, adjusted noninterest expense, excluding restructuring charges and actions taken to the tax reform, was slightly under 1.7 billion, down 1 million from last quarter's adjusted expense. As Kelly mentioned, the tax plan gave us an opportunity to invest in our associates and communities. This included a 36 million one-time bonus payment and 100 million charitable contribution, which will be invested in our communities in the coming years.  Personnel costs included a decline of 16 million due to lower salary expense, equity based comp and higher capitalized salaries, partially offset by higher performance based incentives of about 19 million. Notably, average FTEs declined 729 versus last quarter. Outside IT and professional services were up, due to higher consulting and contracting expenses across several projects. It is also worth noting occupancy and equipment expense declined, reflecting solid progress on consolidating back office locations and branch closures. Continuing on slide 14, our capital, liquidity and payout ratios remains strong. Common equity tier 1 was 10%. Our dividend payout ratio was 42% and our total payout ratio was 103%. This reflects 373 million in share repurchases, which included 53 million de minimis repurchase. The remaining 640 million are expected to occur evenly through the next two quarters. Now, let's look at our segment results. We changed our segments, effective this quarter to align with the reporting management changes with emphasis on faster growth, while continuing to address the needs of our clients. Over the next year, we will continue to refine those allocations. You can see the old segments versus new segments on slide A-10. Continuing on slide 15, community bank retail and consumer finance net income was 263 million, down 33 million from last quarter.  Planned run-off in average mortgage and auto loans drove net interest income decline. The decline in mortgage and retail origination reflects the impact of our optimization strategy. Regarding residential mortgage, loan production was 65% purchase and 35% refi, relatively stable. And gain on sale margins was 1.53% versus 1.85% last quarter. Non-interest expense was up, mostly due to one-time bonus. As you can see, we closed 78 branches for a total of 148 branch closures for 2017. We plan to close 150 more this year. Continuing on slide 16, average loans declined 672 million, mostly due to planned runoff in mortgage and auto. We put plans in place during the fourth quarter to stabilize these portfolios. We expect mortgage to stabilize in the first quarter and auto to stabilize in the second quarter of this year. Deposit balances have been relatively stable and deposit costs relatively unchanged over last year. Turning to slide 17, community bank commercial net income was 233 million, an increase of 3 million from last quarter. Net interest income increased 5 million, mostly due to growth in CRE and demand deposits. We had good increase in our commercial pipeline, which was up 20%. We also saw record loan production due to strong business demand and tax exempt production. Non- interest expense was down 20 million, mostly due to higher capitalized salaries. Continuing to slide 18, average loan balances were up slightly compared to last quarter, however, ending loan balances increased 925 million, reflecting strong loan growth near the end of the quarter. Deposit growth came from increases in the demand deposits.  Turning to slide 19, financial services and commercial finance net income was 136 million, up 24 million. Noninterest income increased 26 million due to across the board fee income gains. Noninterest expense was up 11 million, mostly due to higher incentives. Strong growth in institutional and retail invested assets resulted in more than 12% annualized growth versus third quarter. Continuing on slide 20, we had strong loan growth, led by equipment finance, government finance and wealth. Deposit growth improved, led by money market and savings balances. Interest bearing deposit cost rose 8 basis points, due to the rate sensitive nature of these clients. Turning to slide 21, insurance holdings and premium finance net income totaled 33 million, up 15 million. Noninterest income totaled 428 million, up 27 million mostly driven by seasonality in P&C commissions. Like quarter organic growth was up 2.8%, mostly due to increased new business and higher retention. Noninterest expense was up, mostly due to the one-time bonus. On slide 22, you will see our outlook. Looking to the first quarter, we expect total loans to be 1% to 3% annualized, linked quarter; net charge-offs to be in the range of 35 to 45 basis points, assuming no unexpected deterioration in the economy and the loan loss provision to match net charge-offs plus loan growth; GAAP margin to be down 1 to 3 basis points, with core margin stable compared to fourth quarter due to the adjustment on tax exempt assets from the new corporate tax rate change; fee income to be up 1% to 3% versus like quarter; expenses to be flat versus like quarter, excluding merger related and restructuring charges and other onetime items and effective tax rate of about 21%.  Looking ahead to the full year, we expect to grow loans in the 2% to 4% range, which should be stronger than the 2% from 2017; taxable equivalent revenues up 2% to 4% and expenses flat, excluding merger related and restructuring chargers and other one-time items and an effective tax rate of about 21%. While we continue to -- continue investing and drive improved revenue growth, we feel very confident that our flat expenses will result in positive adjusted operating leverage for full year 2018. In summary, we had very strong fourth quarter earnings, positive adjusted operating leverage for both linked and like quarter, excellent credit quality and good expense control. Now, let me turn it back over to Kelly for closing remarks and Q&A. Kelly King : Thanks, Daryl. So again, just to summarize my point of view. As Daryl said, we did have a strong quarter of positive adjusted operating leverage. That's a big deal. Our adjusted EPS was up 15% versus fourth quarter \u201916. We had a lot of headwinds that are turning into tailwinds. We have a number of key strategic initiatives that I described to you, which will have a big impact during the year and the years beyond. We have laser focused on organic growth, which is a big deal. We think the economy will be better. There will be less taxes, there will be less regulation. To put all that together, it\u2019s a good time to be in banking, so we think 2018 will be a very strong year. Alan Greer : Okay. Thank you, Kelly. At this time, we will begin our Q&A session. Anthony, if you would come back on the line and explain how our listeners may participate in the session? Operator : [Operator Instructions] It appears our first question comes from [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : Daryl, I was wondering on the expense outlook, for keeping expenses flat. It sounds positive. I was wondering, off of what base should we look for that to be flat? I guess that would be kind of the adjusted basis about 6.65, is that the number that we should look for that to be off of? And then that excludes kind of merger and intangibles, so just kind of what's outside of that number that we should think about? Daryl Bible : So, John, if you look at our slide deck, on page 5 in there, Kelly went through and mentioned that, we basically should have reported and all the adjustments coming through. If you look at the very last column on that page, it\u2019s the full year, for 2017, the total noninterest expense is 6.8 billion. If you see that, that's the base that we're talking about, being flat on a year-over-year basis. Unidentified Analyst : And in terms of kind of spending some of the benefits of tax reform, does keeping expenses flat kind of include that as well? Kelly King : John, this is Kelly. Yes. It will. So, we have substantial investments that we are making in the business. We had said we would invest a substantial portion of the tax advantage in to that and we are. So what you can see is that we're making those investments that we alluded to and we're holding expenses flat. So obviously, if we were not making those expenses, investments and our expenses would be down. Daryl Bible : John, what you don\u2019t know is we put our 2000 plan together. Kelly challenged all the business units to basically cut across the board and what we did as a management team is reallocate all the inappropriate investments. That\u2019s how we kept it flat. But we created a pot of money that we basically put into all these investments. Unidentified Analyst : And then just as a follow-up, the outlook for the positive operating leverage also sounds good. What would it take to kind of get to the higher end of that, what would we have to assume to kind of be at the higher end of the revenue growth and operating leverage goal for the year? Kelly King : I think you\u2019ve got a couple of things there, John, that might -- that could do that. Insurance revenues could be higher than we projected, if the market responds with better pricing. Now, the market is not recommend -- or not seeing huge increases. We differ a bit. We think the insurance price increases will be higher because of all the catastrophes and we compete on loan growth and that could cause more positive operating leverage. And interest rates could be, we think that it\u2019s -- we're forecasting, I guess, as Daryl just want and plan, but we think there would be more like 3. So that\u2019s going to be by the end of the year, but you can really think more about 2 versus 1 in terms of what we really think is going to happen. Unidentified Analyst : So if we got 2 or 3, we could be at the high end of that 2 to 4 kind of revenue outlook? Kelly King : That\u2019s fine. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : I was just wondering, on the fee side, you mentioned some of the headwinds abating and I\u2019m just kind of wondering where you expect to see the growth and specifically if you can comment on insurance and pricing and what you think that key business can do inside the fee growth this year? Chris Henson : Sure. This is Chris. We\u2019re seeing really good fee growth as you can see across all the categories. We had insurance, service charges, you saw our private equity business, bank card, check card, so we get really good contribution as retail really comes back. Specifically insurance, I think as Kelly mentioned that, could be a lever for us. Just to kind of give you a background today, pricing is still down 2% and 2.5% kind of range, down from sort of the 4% range. And to drive core growth, you get retention, retention is up year over year. Our business production is up 3.3% in -- which drove organic growth this year at 1.7%, which we're pretty pleased with. But in terms of outlook, what we would expect next quarter is about a 3.5% pickup and Kelly talked about the economy. Economic expansion is really good for the insurance business, because anything that helps drive more units, more exposure to existing clients and more units is very helpful to do business production, but really it's still too early to estimate the full impact of the catastrophes. There is still excess capital in the market.  Everybody is centering on sort of losses in the 130 billion, 135 billion range, which is the largest cat year we've ever had, but offsetting that is the investment income for the carriers that really offset the losses in 2017 and we're still seeing new alternative capital coming into the market, but still reinsurers are seeing rates up about 4% to 5% and what we think that could mean for us is pricing kind of move in for that negative too that stabilized and in the last half of the year and we get another bite of the apple that renewals at mid-year, which should help. But I think you can see pricing up a percent or two, sort of stabilized in the last half of the year and that would be very, very helpful for the business for sure. Daryl Bible : I mean besides insurance, we expect service charges. We\u2019ve had a strong year in \u201917 that continue in \u201918. Our mortgage area continues to grow as we continued our, keeping our penetration in that market, that should be up and then investment banking and brokerage. So \u2013 Chris Henson : Yeah. Investment income, as Daryl mentioned, was up about 12% and we continue to invest in the wealth and in our full service broker, which has got really good momentum. And so we see those as being really good downside kind of protection for us and good growth rates. Ken Usdin : Got it. And the second question, Kelly, I heard your comment saying that you're very focused on organic growth and I'm just wondering how that translates into how you think about both, the tax implications and organic and capital return and this year CCAR. Can you just kind of help us frame, if the focus is on organic, what do you anticipate in terms of the tax benefits for how you think about CCAR and any changes to that thinking in a general sense? Thanks. Kelly King : Well, so I think the organic growth for us is a function of two things. I think the economy is going to be growing faster because of the tax changes and to be honest, the reduction in regulatory constraints out in the marketplace, so that the market growth is driven by taxes and less regulation. Our growth is being driven by a virtue of the fact that our market will be growing faster and we have more focus on actually making the execution strategies that we have worked.  So it's a two part thing for us. As you think about CCAR going forward, the way that all plows into CCAR is your projections in terms of income and what that gives you in terms of the ability to create capital and what do you do with that. So right now, we are solidly capitalized at a 10% common equity tier 1. We don't see the need to increase that. There is some opportunity as time goes on and things stabilize to decrease that. So, as the economy gets better, as organic growth increases, as earnings increase, that just augurs for better capital deployment coming to the CCAR process. Operator : Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : My first question is on the reinvestment of some of the tax windfall. Kelly, I believe you made some comments at a conference in December about potentially investing some of the tax reinvestments and I just wanted to make sure that that's contemplated in the flat guidance and how should we think about the multi-year strategy for investing that windfall. Kelly King : Yes. Erika, as I said then that I thought this was early on remember, but I did say conceptually, to me, it made sense to think about investing about a third in the business, about a third in terms of dividend increases and about a third just kind of falling through to the shareholder through the bottom line. That\u2019s kind of the track we're on. We are making substantial increased investments in a variety of areas, in the business, in terms of restructuring and reinvesting in our community bank, in terms of our digital offering, in terms of the marketing of a digital offering, in terms of cyber security, risk management structures, it\u2019s just a long list of new and increased focuses that we have to make the business better. Now, for clarity, all of that is incorporated in an expected flat expense structure.  So what that means is, as Daryl alluded, we started way back in \u201917 on a very intense re-conceptualization, I call it, disrupt that, focus on our business because we really felt and feel that there are substantial ways to get better and get more efficient and reduce expenses in the basic business. So, we are reducing expenses in the basic business. We are reinvesting in the items I outlined that results in a flat expense structure for \u201918. As we look into \u201919, as I've said a little less clear at this point and, but conceptually, I think it kind of continues in the same vein, because we're just scratching the surface in terms of how to restructure the business and we are, as an executive team, we're really intense about it. I mean, this whole opportunity in terms of advanced capabilities and computers, call it, advanced intelligence -- artificial intelligence, robotics, all of the things that you're reading and hearing about, this is all real and banks are just absolutely loaded with opportunities to apply these new techniques to rationalize our expense structures and become more efficient and more effective at the same time. So, certainly through \u201918 and \u201819, I see a continuation of the same trend, it may even be longer than that, but certainly for those two years, I see that. Erika Najarian : My follow-up question is, there appears to be a bipartisan momentum to change definition of SIFI and in the Senate version, there is certainly an asset threshold that\u2019s attached currently of 250 billion. I thought you were pretty clear about the focus on -- take focus on organic growth this year and I'm wondering if that does -- the SIFI threshold does officially change the 250 billion, does that change your thinking in terms of organic versus inorganic strategy. Kelly King : So, Erika, first of all, I personally don\u2019t know that the 250 is going to make it through. There are a lot of people talking, including us that it would be better not to do the 250 and rather than going to a brighter line, rather move to where institutions are based on the inherent risk in the business, which has been a lot of work done by the Fed on already. So, I hope it doesn't happen. But if it does, it won't change the way we run our business. We're not going to run our business based on whether we're 249 or 251. They're not dramatic changes for our business once we go over 250. Some of the C&I impact will contemplate that. You\u2019ve heard me say, if we have 245 and somebody wants to do a $6 billion merger, we probably wouldn't do it. But as we grow our business, organically, we will clearly move over to 250. We have all of that incorporated into our thinking and it will be net positive because while there's a little thing in terms of expense with regard to going over 250, there's far more advantages in terms of scale of running our business, plus inherent fact is in any business, sort of in our business, [indiscernible]. So for our executive team to say, we're going to get over 249 and stop getting in our tracks, it would be inherently stupid. So we\u2019re going to be running our business smartly and we would be growing and the growth would take us where it takes us. Operator : Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Can you guys give us an update on your BSA/AML work with the regulators, where do you stand on that and how this is progressing? Kelly King : Yes. Gerard, I think we\u2019re in the ninth inning. I mean, basically, we've done everything that we have been expected to do that we think we should do in terms of building a very robust BSA/AML, kind of state-of-the-art system. Obviously, over time, depending on what the regulators require, you will always be continuing to tweak and improve that as you go along, but we've essentially built out what we expected to build out. It's been a very expensive process, we\u2019ve used a lot of outside contractors, consultants. But it's built out, it's running fine and so we're now just in the process of working with the regulators in terms of how much time they want to see it run well before they lift the consent order. So, obviously, we don't control that, but as far as what we have to do, we think we\u2019ve substantially done everything we need to do. Gerard Cassidy : And then a follow-up question is on \u2013 Kelly, you touched on your betas, they\u2019re quite low. You don't expect them to rise meaningfully, if there isn't a significant increase in loan demand. Can you guys share with us the difference in the betas though within the customer base, the consumer deposits tend to have the lowest betas versus the commercial deposits and the high net worth? How does yours differ between the different segments? Daryl Bible : Yeah. Gerard, I\u2019ll take that. Actually, you can see it very clearly in our new disclosures and segment. So in the first segment disclosure of the retail, basically, it has flat interest bearing costs for the last year, so there's been basically zero beta in the consumer portfolios. In the community bank commercial, it has the commercial deposit is up, I think they were up I think maybe eight basis points or so.  And then in the other segment, the financial services one would tend to be the larger clients, more national businesses, those commercial products were up the most. So it's very clear the duration, you can see between each of the deposit categories. But as Kelly said, our average beta is 15% and if you factor in the good growth that we\u2019re getting in our commercial deposits and DDA and all that, it\u2019s really down to 8 basis points. So we\u2019ve had great control of our deposit costs so far. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Rose with Raymond James. Michael Rose : Just wanted to get a sense on what would drive the charge-offs guidance that you gave from the low end to the high end, because it seems like, as you guys derisk the portfolio that charge-offs are coming towards the lower end. And as we move forward, with tax reform, maybe, some of your customers might be performing better. So how should we think longer term about your credit trends? Clarke Starnes : Great point, Michael. This is Clarke. I think the biggest factor that would change the point and the range would be how fast we change the mix. So certainly, Kelly talked about we have some very aggressive strategies at some higher margin businesses and particularly in the retail and subsidiaries that have higher margins and higher normal losses, and so I think if we\u2019re successful in growing some of those businesses faster, then, you would probably see us move higher in the range, but you certainly have offsetting margin to compensate for that. And I would also say the whole industry is operating at a very, very low, probably below trend line level in a very benign environment. So just from normalization, as we move forward, would also move us and others up in the range as well. Michael Rose : And then maybe as a follow up, just to touch on loan growth. Obviously, your guidance relative to the first quarter to the full year implies a pretty steep ramp and I know you guys talked about how the derisking efforts will basically cease come the midpoint of the year, but what areas of the portfolio are you actively growing? Are there any geographies that you guys are experiencing more growth than others? Kelly King : So, Michael, it's really kind of across the board. Our C&I is growing really, really well, particularly in the larger end through our corporate strategy, which has really been robust performance for the last several years and we really are still seeing lots of opportunities across the country, where we just still don't have regional representation. So C&I national business, our equipment national business, our mortgage business is expending more nationally. Remember, we've opened new markets at Texas and Pennsylvania, et cetera and we haven\u2019t fully built out those areas yet. Small business opportunity is very strong as we go forward. So those women Jenna was let me like Christmas on a more specific areas of research you are some of the general ones. Let me let Chris point some of the more specific areas that we\u2019re seeing. Chris Henson : We\u2019re seeing really good growth in Houston, Dallas, Alabama and South Florida, really good growth. North Georgia, including Atlanta and also South Carolina markets, so really good broad based in the new markets, but also some of the core markets like Alabama and South Carolina are doing well. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Unidentified Analyst : This is actually Ricky from Matt\u2019s team. Just a quick question on the securities book. They were up around 2 billion this quarter. Just wondering how much additional capacity there is to add to this book and what\u2019s the strategy from here? Daryl Bible : Yeah. Ricky, this is Daryl. I would tell you that we're basically going to just hold tight. We don't have any plans for 2018 to expand securities. So, the earning asset growth that you see from here on out will be on the loan growth side. So with securities flat, loan growth up in the 2% to 4%, you should have earning assets up about 3% or so. Unidentified Analyst : And then wondering if you could touch quickly on sort of the trajectory for NIM in 2018, I understand there's a bunch of moving pieces, sort of with and without rates, but just generally speaking is it your expectation that core NIM can stay relatively stable, a hike or two this year. Daryl Bible : Yeah. So with the rate increase that we had in December, if we didn't have a corporate tax rate change, we would have adjusted our guidance by 4 basis points, because the lower tax rate -- corporate tax rate basically brought down GAAP and core margin 4 basis points this month, starting in January. So we guided to a flat core would have been up 4 basis points from that perspective.  So all that taken in to account, and as Kelly said, if we have two rate increases throughout the year, I think core will continue to trend up as we have those rate increases and beta continues to lag. Core -- on a reported or GAAP margin basis, we still have the headwind of purchase accounting. So GAAP will be probably relatively flat, maybe up a little bit, more relatively flat for the year, but core continuing to rise if we get a couple of rate increases. Operator : Our next question comes from Saul Martinez with UBS. Saul Martinez : Sorry to beat a dead horse on the reinvestment of the tax windfall and sort of the unit play on cost, but just kind of want to understand the numbers around it a little bit better. So, I think you said at a conference or I think maybe on this call as well that about a third would be -- of the windfall would be reinvested and you've been doing about, I think, last year, you did about 4 billion of pretax earnings, the tax reform will reduce your tax rate by about 10 percentage points. So that comes out to like 400 million, so a third would be 130 million, 135 million in terms of how much is actually reinvested. Is that sort of the right way to think about it in terms of the parameters around how much the magnitude of dollar reinvestment and benefits that you get? Kelly King : Yes. Saul, [indiscernible] That will be reinvested and it will be reinvested in the category areas that I mentioned and that's -- part of it is already ongoing, part of it will be new, but it will be pretty wide spread, but all marginally designed to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of our business and also the client offerings to our business, so that we are fresh and appealing to our clients on the marketplace. Saul Martinez : And if I think about the flat expense guidance, should we be assuming then that you're finding efficiencies in other areas that are roughly of the same magnitude as the 150 million to 200 million that you mentioned? Kelly King : That\u2019s the exactly the way to think about it and we didn\u2019t just start yesterday. We started early in \u201917 with an enhanced internal program. We now are going to announce some kind of a big program, call it, whatever you want to call it. So, we've approached it with the same kind of intensity in terms of restructuring our business. What you saw in the fourth quarter, we reduced our associates by like 800 people. So, you know that we are restructuring the business pretty substantially and we\u2019re simply reinvesting that in the business. Saul Martinez : And on that point, AML/BSA remediation, have you given sort of an order of magnitude in terms of how much benefit you would get once you get that remediated in terms of how much lower cost you would have from -- once you get that remediated, what\u2019s sort of the run rate benefit you get in terms of compliance and control costs? Daryl Bible : Saul, this is Daryl. The AML/BSA remediation is all factored within our guidance. Obviously as Kelly said, we're close to the end AML/BSA. That will be a savings -- that's part of the savings that's been reinvested in the company as altogether part of reinvestment. We haven\u2019t given any specific numbers there. Saul Martinez : And then just finally on the revenue guide, 2% to 4%, how should we think about how that breaks out more or less between non-interest income and NII? Daryl Bible : It's pretty balanced really. With loan growth and the GAAP margin that we have, that's going to be in -- close to 2.5% to 3% if you get in the middle of the range and fee is about the same. So, Chris talked about the fee income. So there's some play in between it, but the way we put the plan together, it's actually pretty balanced between net interest income and non-interest income. Operator : Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Sorry to go back to the expense topic again, but Kelly, when you were talking about how you are -- the areas that you're reinvesting some of the savings and then also pulling back in other areas in order to keep expenses flat for \u201918, you alluded to that that's the goal going forward as well as you look into the following year. So I was just wondering, is your expectation that you're going to fight to keep expenses flattish in \u201819 as well? Kelly King : Obviously, as you know, John, \u201819 is a long way from here in terms of and I'm not giving the official guidance for the 2019. I\u2019m just saying conceptually I believe that the kind of programs that we're executing on again, think about, not just re-conceptualizing your businesses in terms of the processes, but once you re-conceptualize and make the process more efficient, then you overlay on top of that, artificial intelligence, robotics, ways to substantially reduce these expenses by the various smart, sophisticated computers. And so, we are in the early stages of using all of those tools. And so, and from my point of view, again without giving specific guidance, I believe we will -- I know we will intend to continue to focus on that as we get through \u201918 and \u201919, I believe that will keep downward pressure on expenses even as we become better at what we're doing. And so I would not be surprised if we're able to hold expenses in the flattish range \u201918 and \u201919, but I'm not going to make a commitment on that. \u201918 in to \u201919. Yeah. John Pancari : And then just back to loan growth, I appreciate some of the color you gave us in terms of the drivers, can you just talk to us -- give us an update around your appetite to grow commercial real estate balances and then separately your appetite to grow auto? Thank you. Clarke Starnes : John, this is Clarke. We're pretty bullish on very high quality real estate opportunities right now. Certainly, it's still a very aggressive marketplace, but we have an emerging more national platform with some very professional bankers. So we're doing larger more institutional lease supported projects, pretty low risk. So we think that as an opportunity that we're probably underpenetrated in and we can grow safely within our risk appetite, some of the areas, industrial, office. We continue to see with the economy improving and housing being strong, good, solid single family construction, things like that on the CRE book.  And then on auto, we\u2019ve been focused obviously on the optimization to increase the margin so that certainly could hit on volume. But I think our strategy now is to take that business more nationally. We do think that we have an opportunity in the middle on the near prime side, we've been on the super prime and on our traditional business and in our real estate subsidiaries, really lower subprime. So we think there's a way to have a full spectrum offering there. A lot of new investments in scorecards and process and center consolidation and a lot of investment to execute that strategy, so we're bullish on both of those businesses. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Scouten with Sandler O'Neill. Stephen Scouten : Yes. So curious more about the strategic initiative or strategic push into retail that you said will be accentuated. I'm curious is that just more of what probably we\u2019re just speaking to of the near prime auto or are there other initiatives within retail that you'll focus on more fully or again is it just maybe not the drag that you've had over the last two years in mortgage and auto. Kelly King : So, it\u2019s kind of multifaceted, Stephen. It's the elimination of the drag that we've had and the dilutive investments we\u2019ve made in newer markets. Those will be getting better in all respects, including retail. It is the elimination of the drag from auto and mortgage that Clarke has described and it is just frankly making the business more productive. We have a real opportunity to apply more management focus and the fact is the community bank has gotten to be much more complex over the last several years, as we have many new offerings around digital, et cetera, et cetera. We've been basically driving that from an executive point of view with one person overseeing and driving the entire retail bank, I mean, the entire community bank.  What we have done effective January 1 is we\u2019ve divided that so that David Weaver is continuing to drive the community bank commercial and Brant Standridge, one of our newer, younger executive leaders who's had a lot of experience out in the field, has had a lot of experience in auto and mortgage and specialized in these businesses, he is now driving directly every day the brand side, the retail side of the community bank. So basically, we've doubled the executive amplitude, executive leadership in the community bank and we know that is going to generate substantially more performance as we laser focus in on the productivity of the sources that we have invested in that side of the bank. Stephen Scouten : And maybe my last -- other question would be if you had to think about an area of focus where you thought you could maybe exceed the guidance that you've laid out in the presentation, where do you think that would be? I mean, could loan growth end up being significantly better if we get an uptick in the economy or could your NIM move higher, like, maybe restructuring, becoming more asset sensitive or even do you think you could see actual net reductions in expenses? Are there any of those areas where you think you could maybe exceed what you're putting out there today? Kelly King : Well, obviously, we always try to exceed everything we've put out. That\u2019s just our nature. We\u2019re a bunch of high achievers. But practically, I would say the most likely area that we could exceed would be on the loan area. We're still relatively conservative in terms of what we project. But if the economy takes off faster, which I think there's a decent chance of, I mean, the global economy is good, as you saw this morning in China, that 6.9% GDP, Japan has had six consecutive quarters of increasing GDP, Europe is doing fine. The US\u2019s tax code is just being implemented as we speak, regulatory restrain is down lower. There is some really good chance in my mind that the economy will do better, particularly Main Street, and BB&T is right in the middle of Main Street. If we beat in the area, I think it will be loans. Operator : And our next question comes from Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Nancy Bush : A couple of questions, Kelly, on the run-off portfolio, can you just sort of gives us an idea or a rough estimate of how much of that was organically generated versus acquired? And when you look at the organically generated portion of it and you look back and, okay, here's why we're having to run it off, can you just tell us, I guess, what happened. Kelly King : Yeah. Nancy, so it's mostly the organic and what happened in those businesses is, as we were -- as the market was moving along through \u201916, \u201917, we've been in the business a long time. What we saw was the spread just kept getting tighter and tighter and tighter and the returns on equity got to be tighter and tighter and tighter. And so that was driving the profitability of the business down. And then you may recall Nancy that the CFPB came in with an iron club and made us change the way we priced our product through our -- indirect auto purchasing through auto dealerships and that caused the substantial runoff in that business.  And so because the market itself was getting too unprofitable, because the structure that we went to based on CFPB guidance, both of those combined, drove the volume down in auto. And in mortgage, it was the same thing. It was just a spread on mortgage. It was just getting too low. I mean, the returns were just not satisfactory and we\u2019re more focused on capital optimization for our shareholders and we are growing. We simply said these markets are irrational, we're not going to continue to deploy capital in a rational business segment. And so we pulled back and made our structure so that what we were looking was rational and reasonable from a ROE point of view.  So now we've run that down. In the auto case, frankly, we believe we're going to be very soon moving back to a more traditional auto pricing program like we had before. That will increase that volume in to auto portfolio and the spreads will remain good. In the mortgage business, we've simply run off the lower yielding part of that and we've expanded and diversified this organic growth and acquisitions on a national basis, so that we're able to get the volumes that allow the portfolio to grow at acceptable returns. Nancy Bush : So my point here is you feel at this point that the guidelines are -- the checkpoints or whatever are in place that we're not looking at another run off portfolio in 2, 3, 5 years? Kelly King : No. That's exactly right, Nancy. [indiscernible] foundation, build a program so that going forward, you won\u2019t hear us saying, we will grow this year and not grow next year. This is a core part of our bears, I\u2019d say the amount of positive growth trajectory as far as I can see. Nancy Bush : Second question is this, you said that you're near your -- the end of your investments into the Pennsylvania franchise. And I guess what are we two or three years down the road to I guess. Are you going to get what you want from that acquisition, which was somewhat controversial at the time? When you look back on it, are you going to get what you thought you were going to get? Kelly King : Well, it was controversial to me. But yes, we're going to get what we expected. But look, the mergers, Nancy, have been around a long time, like I have and I\u2019ve been around longer than you Nancy, I\u2019m not trying. Nancy Bush : Okay. I\u2019ll take your word for that. Kelly King : But look, mergers are always a painful process for the first two or three years. If you did it for the first two or three years, you would never do one. You do it for the long haul. You do it for market opportunities and so Pennsylvania just turned out, just like, exactly like I knew it would turn out. Pennsylvania's a big market. It is a stable market. It is a high net worth market. And so it's exactly where we thought it would be and we're very pleased from a long term point of view.  We just had to go through this process. The reason you haven't heard as much about this and some mergers, remember, when we were doing most of our mergers for all the years, the whole economy was running and gunning. So you could do a merger, you could go through what I call the thermal process where you go through the dilution and restructuring of the portfolios, but it didn't show up because the rest of the whole market was growing so fast. In reality, this merger is turning out about like all other mergers and we've gone through the painful part, is a great long term investment as what we thought and begins what we think now and we're very happy about it. Nancy Bush : So you're going to get -- are you going to get growth there? Or are you primarily going to get funding there? Or do you see both? Kelly King : We get both. We really get funding, but we get growth. Look, I mean, the Pittsburgh, I mean, sorry, the Philadelphia market is a great market and huge wealth, not just deposit, but lending businesses, the corporate businesses there, the trade services, the middle part of Pennsylvania is exactly like North Carolina, really stable balanced growth opportunities for us. So, yeah, it will be deposits that will be growth in loans and it will be relative improvement in efficiency. Operator : And it appears we have time for no other questions. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Alan Greer for any additional or closing remarks. Alan Greer : Okay. Thank you, Anthony. This concludes our call. We hope that everyone has a good day. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Good morning, everybody and thanks for joining our call. So, I think we had strong quarter with record earnings and returns, very good expense control, continued healthy asset quality and really, we have strong commercial loan growth if you adjust for the mortgage warehouse lending. Net income available to common shareholders was a record $745 million, up 97% versus the first quarter, and adjusted net income was a record $767 million. Diluted EPS was a record $0.94, up 104% versus first quarter and to adjust for diluted EPS for merger and loss on extinguishment of debt in first quarter is up -- it was $0.97, up 31%. But the way I think about this in time to get it through a real comparable run rate I go into pretax ex mergers and ex loss on extinguishment of debt to get it to real apples-to-apples in it\u2019s still up I think strong 5% versus first quarter, which is really good on a 2% environment. Adjusted returns; ROA was 1.49, common equity was 11.75 and internal tangible was 19.89, so all very, very good returns. And very importantly we did achieve positive operating leverage on a debt basis versus the fourth quarter and the first. Taxable equivalent revenues totaled $2.8 billion up 0.6% versus first quarter. Virtually the net interest margin increased 1 basis to 3.44, our core margin increased 4 basis points, both were a little bit better than we expected. Our fee income ratio was 41.9. Our adjusted efficiency ratio was 57.3 versus 57.2. But if you adjust for the system outage, which Daryl will give you more color on, the efficiency ratio would've been down. Our adjusted non-interest expense of $1.68 billion, a decrease 9.3% annualized versus fourth quarter and a decrease of 1% versus first quarter. So, we have decreased expenses linked and like, including increased expenses for the future. We\u2019re making substantial investments in the future investments for risk management, infrastructure transformation, digital product development platform, enhancements and marketing. And Chris is going to give you a special breakout commentary with regard to some of those investments. Our credit quality remained excellent. NPAs did increase a couple basis points but we\u2019ve told you in the past we\u2019re at the bottom, you will see a little bouncing around the bottom that doesn\u2019t mean anything. And importantly, it decreased 6 basis points from a like quarter basis. We did have seasonally higher charge-offs, 41 basis points versus 36 basis points in the fourth. But if you go to like quarter, which you should, it\u2019s very, very comparable and little bit down. We did have a strategic announcement to acquire the Regions Insurance Group, which we\u2019re very happy about. This was a great addition from both a cultural and a market perspective. It strengthened our presence in many of our Southeast markets and importantly, it expanded us into new markets in Texas, Louisiana and Indiana. And we did increase our common dividend 13.6%, which we\u2019re very pleased with. On Page 4, if you are following along on the deck, we did have some merger and restructuring charges of $28 million pretax, 22 after tax, which was about $0.03 per share. We didn\u2019t try to qualify for you the impact with regard to outage, but Daryl is going to give a little color with regard to that and its impact as well. If you look at Page 5, we always like to grow our sales relative to the guidance we have provided for you. So, if you look at average loans, the guidance was 1 to 3 we came in at 0.6. I could say around at 1 but I won't say that, but it did came little shy of that. But if you ex the mortgage warehouse, which you can really need to because it\u2019s very, very volatile then it was an adjusted 1.8, which was right in the middle of the guidance. Credit quality was right in the middle of 41 basis points. Net interest margin, I would say, was up on GAAP and core. Non-interest income was a little light. We said 1 to 3, it was 0.8. But again, if you exclude the estimated impact from the system outage, fees would have been up 2%. So, it would have been in right in middle of guidance. Expenses were real positive, down versus the flat we have projected. So, we\u2019ve got really good folks on expense control, and frankly expense control for the rest of the year looks great. If you look at Page 6 on loan growth, we had what I\u2019d call strong core commercial loan growth. Now, our total loan growth as you can see was 0.6%, but again if you ex the mortgage warehouse its 1.8. But importantly, we think if you look at core commercial loan growth, it is 5.2% ex the mortgage warehouse, has substantial growth in a number of areas. Commercial real estate was up 7.7%, revolving credit of 5.7%, commercial leasing up 4.6%, mortgage 3.8% annualized, government finance and Grandbridge experienced double-digit annualized growth. So, it's pretty broad-based in that commercial growth. So, I feel really good about 5.2% core growth in this market. And I just want to point out that we told you in January that we expected mortgage to turn in the first, it did. We told you we expected indirect to turn by about midyear, it will. And so, it's going exactly as we had expected, knock on wood, and we feel good about that. I will give you just a bit of commentary in regards to market. We\u2019ve recently averaged the Kennebec 24 regions in the last few weeks. I\u2019ll tell so actually even with a lot of the conversation coming out of Washington, the attitude of business owners and our officers that deal with them are very, very positive. They seem to be focusing on what\u2019s happening versus what\u2019s been said, which is actually a very pretty instructive way to think about it. Our pipeline in all areas is all time highs, which is very, very positive as we think going forward. So, we do we expect loan growth to improve as we go forward for two basic reasons; the market, we think is positive out there and that it\u2019s going to begin to turn into loan growth as the pipeline begins to move through; and optimizing portfolios are moving from a big tailwind, a big headwind to a tailwind as we projected and that\u2019s a good thing. If you look at next page with regard to deposits, not a lot to say there. Our non-interest-bearing deposits were down 6.7% that\u2019s seasonal adjustment. It was down a little more than the season investments were called for. So, we think clients are beginning to use cash, which we\u2019ve been talking about and that\u2019s a very positive development. We begin to see just a little bit of line draw downs, which is very positive development. So, all of that is moving, which portends the economy beginning to have a confidence to go ahead and make some investments and move forward. So, our cost of funds is moving up some and we can expect some additional increase. But I would point out that our betas are still at 17% since they started rising and we\u2019re 24% in the first quarter and probably go up a little more. And Daryl can give you more detail on that, but I'm pretty comfortable that betas have not going to just really take off. And loan growth takes off and if loan growth takes off, we\u2019re going to afford for betas to take off, so I feel pretty confident in terms of earnings impact about that as we go forward. Let me turn it now to Daryl for some additional color. Daryl Bible : Thank you, Kelly and good morning, everyone. Today, I\u2019m going to talk about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, non-interest expense, capital, segment results and provide some guidance for second quarter and full year 2018. Turning to Slide 8. Credit quality remained strong. Net charge-offs totaled $145 million or 41 basis points, up 5 basis points, but down one from last year. We've been running below normal levels for a while and this increase reflects some normalization. Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing as a percent of loans and leases decreased 4 basis points for the fourth quarter and from a year ago. Loans 30 to 89 days past due decreased 16 basis points from year-end, mostly due to seasonal improvement. This was up slightly compared to last year. The NPA ratio was up 2 basis points but down six basis points from a year ago. The slight increase was mainly due to CRE and leasing portfolios, and an increase in foreclosed properties. Continuing on Slide 9. Our allowance coverage ratios remained strong at 2.55 times for net charge-offs and 2.49 times for NPLs. The allowance to loans ratio was 1.05%, up slightly. We recorded of a provision of $150 million compared to net charge-offs of $145 million. Turning to Slide 10. The reported net interest margin was 3.44%, up 1 basis point. Core margin was 3.32%, up 4 basis points. Excluding tax reform, reported margin would have been up 3 basis points. The increase in GAAP and core margin reflects asset sensitivity to December rate hike and higher LIBOR rate. We were successful in repricing our tax-exempt loans higher in the wake of tax reform. Deposit betas continue to come in lower than expected with most of the increase in deposit costs coming from index accounts. Since November 2015, cumulative deposit beta has been 17%. During the quarter, deposit beta has been higher at 24%. Asset sensitivity increased slightly due to the increase in free funds and balance sheet mix changes. Continuing on Slide 11. Our fee income ratio was 41.9%, down slightly mostly due to seasonality. Non-interest income totaled $1.2 billion. Investment banking and brokerage had a strong quarter and was $22 million higher than last year. Insurance income was up $18 million, mostly driven by seasonality and employee benefits. Service charges on deposits were down $18 million, mostly due to system outage we had in February. We decided to enter on the side of the client, refunding many fees whether they are related to the outage or not. The cost was about $15 million in lower deposit service charges and about $5 million higher operating expenses. Other income decreased $40 million, mainly due to decline in private equity investments and certain post-employment benefits. When you exclude the system outage, we would have had positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis on a linked quarter. Continuing on Slide 12. Adjusted non-interest expense, excluding restructuring charges, came in at $1.66 billion, down 39 million from last quarter's adjusted expense number. Personnel costs included a decline of $33 million due to last quarter's $36 million of bonuses related to tax reform, partially offset by the typical seasonal increase of $25 million due to compensation related items. Notably, FTEs declined 576 versus last quarter. Other expenses were down $127 million, mostly due to $100 million charitable contribution in the fourth quarter. In addition, FASB changed how we account for our pension cost. Only service costs are allowed in personnel expense -- only servicing costs. That means that the benefit on investment returns now go into other expense. These costs were down $15 million versus last quarter, and will be repeated for the rest of the year. Merger-related and restructuring charges were up $6 million, mostly due to our facilities optimization. Continuing on Slide 13. Our capital and liquidity and payout ratios remained strong; common equity Tier 1 was at 10.2%; our dividend payout ratio was at 39%; and our total payout ratio was at 82%. This reflected $320 million in share repurchases, leaving the same amount in share repurchases authority for the second quarter. LCR was 144% and our liquid asset buffer remains very strong at 15.1%. Looking ahead to CCAR '18, we plan to increase the common dividend while maintaining our capital ratios. We expect our recent announcement to purchase Regions Insurance will impact the third quarter share buyback. Now, let's look at our segment results, beginning on Slide 14. Community bank retail and consumer finance net income was $324 million up $61 million. Net interest income was $886 million, down $9 million, mainly due to fewer days, partially offset by wider spreads on deposits. Non-interest income was down $19 million, mostly due to the system outage. Regarding residential mortgage and loan production mix was 65% purchase and 35% refi similar to last year. And the gain on sale margin was 1.72% versus 1.53% last quarter. Residential mortgage closings were down 16% similar to the MBA forecasted 17% drop. Non-interest expense was down $22 million, mostly due to one-time bonus last quarter. We closed a net of two branches and expect to close 80 in the second quarter, and plan to close about 150 this year. Continuing on Slide 15. Average loans declined, driven by seasonality in the mortgage warehouse lending and run-offs in prime auto. As expected, the mortgage loan portfolio stabilized. We continue to expect prime auto to turn and to begin growing in the second quarter. Deposit balances increased $420 million with growth in DDA and money market accounts. And interest-bearing deposit costs were up 2 basis points implying a deposit beta of about 10%. Turning to Slide 16. Community banking commercial net income was $270 million, an increase of $36 million. Net interest income decreased $12 million, mostly due to fewer days, partially offset by a higher deposit costs. We had a good increase in our commercial pipeline, which was up compared to year end. Continuing on Slide 17. Average loan balances were up $642 million C&I and CRE were up and annualized 6% and 4%, respectively. Deposits were down $737 million due to a seasonal decline in non-interest-bearing deposits. Interest-bearing deposit costs were up 9 basis points, implying a deposit beta of about 45%. Turning to Slide 18. Financial services and commercial finance net income was $144 million, up $8 million. Non-interest income was down $14 million, mostly due to lower trading gains and commercial mortgage banking seasonality. However, compared to our like quarter, non-interest income was up $21 million, driven by investment banking and brokerage managed account fees. Continuing on Slide 19. Average loans were up $492 million with all lines of business seeing growth. Deposits were down slightly, reflecting seasonality. Interest-bearing deposit costs were up 13 basis points, implying a deposit beta of about 65%. Turning to Slide 20. Insurance and premium finance net income totaled $62 million, up $29 million. Non-interest income totaled $439 million, up $11 million, mostly driven by seasonality. Like quarter organic growth was up 3%, mostly due to 12% increase in new business. Regional insurance will add about $70 plus million in revenue for the second half of the year. Non-interest expense was down $18 million, mostly due to one-time bonus we paid in the fourth quarter. On Slide 21, you will see our outlook. Looking at the second quarter, we expect total loans to be up 1% to 3% annualized linked quarter; net charge-offs to be in the range of 30 to 45 basis points; and loan loss provision to match net charge-offs plus loan growth; GAAP margin to be stable and core margin to be up slightly; fee income to be up 2% to 4% versus like quarter and expenses to be down 1% to 3% versus like quarter, excluding merger-related restructuring charges and other one-time items; and an effective tax rate of 21%. Looking ahead for full year 2018, we expect loans to grow in the 1% to 3% range. This decline from previous annual guidance reflects the actual loan growth from the first quarter. Taxable equivalent revenues are expected to be in the 2% to 4% range. This includes the impact of Regions Insurance in the second half for the year. Expenses are expected to be flat to down 1%, excluding merger-related and restructuring charges and other one-time items. The improvement from the previous guidance reflects additional expense control initiatives and the reduction in FDIs surcharges in the fourth quarter. This also includes the impact of Regions Insurance in the second half of 20118. And an effective tax rate of 20% to 21%. We expect our first quarter revenue momentum to continue and we feel very confident at flat to down non-interest expenses will result in positive adjusted operating leverage for full year 2018. In summary, we had record quarterly earnings, positive operating leverage, strong credit quality and excellent expense control. Now, let me turn it over to Chris to talk about some of the investments we\u2019re making to serve our clients and grow revenue for the company. Chris Henson : Thank you, Daryl and good morning. We are making significant investments, primarily around three areas; risk management, backroom infrastructure really to help drive efficiencies; and then front room functionality to help drive revenue. We first look at the risk management. We\u2019ve invested significant amount of dollars. I think we\u2019ve been pretty transparent around at in BSA/AML also in cyber security as we think the leader in that area, and also infra where we\u2019ve doubled down this past year in fraud expense. In terms of backroom digital investments, most of that would be in the area, and I am just going to tick through a list of items that we have underway as we speak. And this is not all inclusive list but represents I think a good breath of what we're doing. First is the continued investment in our leading new retail platform. We\u2019re doing things like credit and debit card controls where you have spend controls where you can limit spend in certain geographic area on/off controls, et cetera. What we\u2019re really excited about is Siri payment for Zelle. So if you want to activate Zelle, you can do it through fingerprint or facial recognition. That should be out in next 30 to 45 days. We\u2019re also embedding a financial planning tool integrated within U, called EMPOWER for our private wealth clients which we think would be very helpful, and then assorted group of debit card fraud alerts. We have really ramped up over the last year and half our digital marketing campaigns, and really increased that at the rate of about 70% and about 86% of those have a digital component. And to give you an example, our retail checking opened online is up first quarter \u201918 over \u201917 by 13.5%, business checking is up about 43%, retail savings is up [9.2%], bank card up about 70% all over the line. So we\u2019re actually reaching really good success with that. We began the fourth quarter implementing something we call Voice of the Client, which is a digital platform that integrates with our business lines and we continue to roll it out this year and in \u201919. That really provides near real-time feedback on client issues towards businesses so they can deal with them immediately, and we\u2019re seeing very, very good success with that in the early stages. It also allows them the ability through an iPad to be able to access that information, as I say, pretty near real-time. We\u2019ve implemented Zelle to-date, our lunch date was December 14th. We've enrolled 164,000 clients. We\u2019re opening -- enrolling about 1,400 per day and we\u2019re moving about $1 million a day if you include both incoming and outgoing transactions. In the second quarter, we\u2019ll implement TCH Faster Payments on the receive payments side and then in third quarter, we should be able to originate payments for our business clients. Another area that we\u2019re really excited about, in February, we rolled out a new mobile app for auto business really to help our clients self-serve and be able to do things like make payments, make promises to pay, just look at the reserves, and we\u2019ve had 15,000 downloads and made 11,000 payments just since February \u201918. We\u2019re implementing something called commercial portal, which is really to simplify the ability for our commercial clients to access our treasury systems really with a single sign-on I think that\u2019s going to be very helpful. And then from an agile dev ops perspective, we've really started a couple of years ago, agile teams in IT area and we\u2019re really beginning to build out our built -- remove out our overall scale of implementing our new rule skills to really to help us, really being to elevate. I am going to focus on three primary areas initially, one is building a small business on-boarding project, as well as some retail online accounts, our ability to open accounts like home equity, unsecured auto and also digital mortgage platform. And as Kelly has mentioned in some calls past, we started really about a year ago now rolling out robotics in our organization today. We have stood up about 25 bots and 10 processors or so and growing fast. We've got about 75 additional ones. We\u2019re in the process of evaluating and implementing. And then eSavings are really across the whole company. So it\u2019s a digital initiatives just to give a sense. Our other areas we\u2019re really excited about is front room functionality, and I really comment on a few items we have going on in retail, commercial and also in insurance. You heard Kelly say that in second quarter, we expect our auto business to turn. And one of the primary reasons for that is we, historically as you know, had a prime and a subprime business but we really have not had a new prime business. A couple of months ago, we rolled out near prime and it's really working well and we've seen a ramp-up in revenue opportunity out of that business. Also implementing a branch home equity loan product, closing the branches that runs on our mortgage rail, expect to have that up in a couple of months. And in June, we\u2019ll roll out a whole new credit card lineup that really offers we think aggressive market-based features, gives travel products to all segments of our clients and really excited about that. In mortgage, we\u2019re strongly considering and we\u2019ll likely open as we have really over the last two or three years some additional de novo markets within a large corporate business in St. Louis, Denver and Northwest, all under evaluation. We are now participating and syndicating credit through national auto dealerships. We really begin back at the end of last year and we think that can bring some additional balances in this year. In insurance, as Kelly and Daryl both commented on the acquisition Regions Insurance, was something we were very pleased about. We think it really provides us strategic catalyst to really restructure retail side of our business. And they have -- it's in our backyard, they\u2019re in 10 states, they provide -- we have overlap at six of those states and in Arkansas and Pennsylvania -- I mean Louisiana where we did not have effective markets, they had acquired the largest agencies in those markets. So we\u2019re going to the new markets in a sizeable way, really excited about that. And then finally in insurance, we have really got a head start in implementing robotics there and so really good opportunities in robotics and also machine learning. So really excited about some of the revenue opportunities and investments that we have made and stand to harvest looking forward. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to you. Kelly King : Thanks Daryl and Chris. So in summary, I would say the record quarter, record earnings and returns, strong core commercial loan growth, our optimizing portfolios are turning, that's a big deal. We have really strong disciplined and expense focus. But as you just heard, we have substantial future investments to increase our relationship with our clients. We have positive operating leverage expecting going forward. We have excellent asset quality. We have strong market momentum. By the way, there was a recent study that came out that looked at the best markets in the country in terms of economic opportunity and we\u2019re in seven of the 10. We have three of our largest new markets that we've invested in that being Florida, Texas and Pennsylvania. All of which are turning and relatively making a big positive benefit as we go forward and have enormous opportunity. So all of that put together helps me to still conclude our best days are ahead. Alan? Alan Greer : Thank you, Kelly. At this time, I'll ask the operator to come back on the line and explain how our listeners can join and participate in the Q&A session. Euglena, if you would come back on and explain please. Operator : Certainly [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : You're guiding for 2018 for 200 to 500 basis points of positive operating leverage, and you just spent about 10 minutes going through all the investments. So can you just tell us why you're confident about that positive operating leverage? And highlight maybe some of the segments, including insurance. Kelly King : So Mike, the way we can do that is because we\u2019ve been talking for the last couple of years about our consistent focus and it\u2019s been building in effectiveness with regard to re-conceptualizing our business. So if you look just from the start and say how could that be implicit to your question. How it can be is that we are restructuring re-conceptualizing all aspects of our business front and backroom. And so basically what we're doing is we're harvesting expenses from the backroom and shifting into the front room. It\u2019s like I\u2019ll use an analogy with our board, it's like you're living in a house and you\u2019re building a new house for the future. You have to take care of the house you\u2019re in and you have to invest for the future. But you don\u2019t have to spend the same money on the existing house that you\u2019re in while you\u2019re investing for the house of the future. So it's about re-conceptualization that's why robotics, AI, all of that is critical. It changed over the last 15 to 20 years, Mike, is this. We now have the tools through advanced automation to be able to do all the things we have to do better, more efficiently and reinvest that money for the future with regard to client satisfaction and revenue. Mike Mayo : And by business line, I\u2019m actually here with our insurance analyst, maybe she can ask as far as the improving efficiency or what you expect. In the insurance line, you said the Regions Insurance acquisition could perhaps help you restructure the retail insurance. But Elyse Greenspan, my colleague on the insurance, I think. Elyse Greenspan : So my specific question on insurance, I was hoping you can give us more color on the pricing environment. You guys seemed a little bit more optimistic in the fourth quarter. Did you see improving prices in the first quarter? And how do you see the improving pricing environment translating into a pickup in your revenue growth within your insurance business during the balance of 2018? Kelly King : Sure, it\u2019s a great question and very insightful. So in the first quarter, we absolutely did see a pickup in pricing. We saw, as you probably heard me on the fourth quarter talk about pricing in the down 2% to 3% range, we actually saw pricing in the up 2% range following the hurricanes we saw in the fall. And I\u2019ll talk about outlook in just a minute, but more about the first quarter. Our retention really is industry relating and retail at 92% to 93%, wholesale is probably more than 75% range, which is also very strong. But one thing we also saw, which is driven by just a better economic environment is, we had 11.8% new business production. I haven't seen that kind of new business production in probably two or three years, and that is purely driven by new exposures and opportunities in the economic market. By comparison, fourth quarter was 3.7%. So our core organic growth really jumped from what was been last year in the 1.5% range to 3% given those factors, the pricing, the new business and the retention. On the other side of that, we also have a number of operating opportunities. One is very obvious to you with the acquisition of Regions. You might recall if you pay attention to our business over a last say five or six years, we've done several strategic large-scale items; we had CRC wholesale in 2012; we acquired Crump, which frankly was Marsh\u2019s wholesale business; and then in \u201915, we acquired Swett & Crawford, which was Aon\u2019s old wholesale business. And we really have scaled up in that channel. There is not a lot else we need to do there. We are now focused on trying to do something similar in retail. And the Regions Insurance gives us an opportunity to do that. It\u2019s about 15% the size of our retail business. So it enables us to -- with the business in our backyard to really begin to do some of the same scale than we did in wholesale. We\u2019ve already, as you\u2019ve heard me say, had robotics and machine learning with some really good opportunities in some areas where we already have perfected workflow, we just need to go back now and have bots turn into some of the digital workers, if you will. And there's good opportunities there in the backroom, I would say to drive margin over the next two to three years. In terms of outlook, which I think is where you were headed with your question. We expect just a normal seasonal pickup next quarter of commissions to be up in the 7% to 8%. We expect economic expansion continue to be good, which we think is going to help drive unit growth and the new business production that we\u2019ve already seen. And I should say the contribution is coming from both retail and wholesale. In this insurance cycle, wholesale obviously is stronger than retail. You follow that just because following large catastrophes, capital tends to lean toward the wholesale side of business. Still pretty tough to impact the full impact of the catastrophes given the access capital to markets. And we know is centered on $135 billion to $150 billion in losses but you also have offsetting that fresh capital coming into the market. So I can just tell you that we\u2019re up a couple percent currently. What we're seeing is property rights continue to increase at a modest pace. Carriers are really trying to get casualty rates up and professional is fairly flat. You\u2019ve seen reinsurance markets raise their rates in the low to mid single digits but we think there's a good opportunity to hold at 2% up, which is a lot different than in 2% to 3% down market for the balance of the year. Now, that could change. We\u2019ll have new reinsurance rates coming out in the middle of the year. But we feel good about pricing, we feel good about, our retention is industry-leading, our business production is as good as it's been and we\u2019ve got a number of operating items work on the bottom line. We really feel pretty positive of being able to drive better operating performance over the next couple years in this business. Operator : Thank you. We will move next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Kelly, you mentioned that you've been out in your markets over the past couple of months and there is a lot of optimism. What do you think is going to be the catalyst to take that optimism to actually see an acceleration in commercial loan demand through your franchise? Kelly King : Gerard, I had thought a lot about that and I think it comes down to what I call the boomer effect. So our most of the businesses in this country are either owned or run by boomers, and when 2008, 2009 came along boomers and most of which came from fairly a bigger backgrounds not all of them most they got scared because they have build up a nice comfortable and financial position they lost half of it, they got scared and so this has taken them a while to get their confidence back and be willing nicely to execute, so what you are seeing now is optimism their confidence is there but if they delivered and it's evaluating all this products and I hear the discussion is like it normally they might have taken too much evaluating now they have taken six month to evaluate this probably been very cautious.  But I think all of that is just about the play out and so through that their nature of these boomers are still they are achievers, they are growers and they are not real quick and so I think it's right around the corner in terms of turning into actual long executions and planned expansions, equipment purchases and enhanced with our growth and the economy. We will see I would say by the third quarter, you will begin to see it evidenced in loan growth for us and others, and then growth in the economy. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then, following up about loan growth, your commercial real estate loan growth was decent in the quarter. Can you share with us two things? One, what type of commercial real estate loans are you having the most success with? And in your region, geographically, are you seeing more growth in Florida versus North Carolina? And then I don't know if Clarke's in the room, but if he is, is there any comments you can make about the underwriting? What are you guys seeing in terms of underwriting standards in the commercial real estate area? Clarke Starnes : As far as areas of focus for us we're seeing some really nice opportunities as the economy is transforming more digitally in ecommerce much more in the industrial and the distribution marks distribution centers so we're taking the advantage of that and I would say that's pretty much across the board in a lot of our markets, across the mid-Atlantic and the Southeast. We are also doing some hospitality very conservative select retail things like single credit tenants, local anchored grocery, conservative opportunities there and then we are still seeing some in the right markets, certain selected but multifamily opportunity so I think for us it's fairly widespread. So, I wouldn\u2019t say one market over another stands out. I think it's pretty broad-based.  Now as far as underwriting considerations, we are being very careful one of the things that we are seeing that is a little unique right now is it seems a little counterintuitive, some of your construction and development opportunities are probably maybe lower risk than some of the permanent than the fact that you can get really strong equity sponsorship in terms if you are willing to take the seasoning in a lease up risk and if it all works then your ongoing cash flow coverages and debt yields look very strong. Whereas -- but if a loan is fully leased up right now the market is extraordinarily aggressive as far as demand or leverage in the low coverages they are willing to take. So, we're a little more cautious on the permanent side and we are letting a lot of that and go to the secondary market. But overall, I think our underwriting standards are pretty consistent with the more through the cycle look. Gerard Cassidy : Clarke, in the permanent market, are you referring more to the insurance companies then, and other types of financial companies rather than other banks or is other banks included in that as well? Kelly King : It's mostly the nonbanks it would be the insurance companies, any capital markets executions and then big one on the multifamily size, are the GSEs. Operator : We will move next to Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : I really appreciate some of the specifics that you laid out in terms of your investments spend. And you have kept your efficiency ratio stable at 57% and your guidance for 2018 is pretty clear. As we look to 2019 the street has a 58% efficiency ratio which is ahead of where you have posted over the past two quarters. I\u2019m wondering if you could sort of just take what you told us a step further and maybe talk about the impact on efficiency as the revenue opportunities or that you mentioned that Chris was listing out, actually become more mature in '19? And also, what that means for the expense trajectory beyond this year? Kelly King : I think what we are hearing say is that we are making these investments. A, we are substantially paying for these investments by expenses where we are extracting from the old business the background if you will. You are right as we head into '19 those investments will turn into revenue enhancements and so I\u2019d say for street is thinking 58% efficiency in the '19 is reaching too hard. So, we see as we move through '19 as from the revenue those are -- I\u2019m projecting the economies getting better so I\u2019m assuming these are revenue growth which is obviously a part of that equation. But we have got a tight control of expenses even with these investments and where these investments turning into more revenue and the economy doing better I think what we are guiding you towards is 57 to down in terms of efficiency ratio versus up. Erika Najarian : And in that context, it seems as if you have a very disciplined process for allocating investment spend. Can expense stay similarly flat in 2019 as you contemplate future expenses? Kelly King : Erika, I got the same question in January. I\u2019m not to make '19 projections at this point but honestly I think there is a piece of chance as we look through '18 and '19 that the best way to think about our expenses are kind of flattish to downish. I don\u2019t see any major driver that could be driving expense up. I think we can make all the investments that we described by harvesting the expense opportunities on the other side. And frankly we are just really, really intense. I\u2019m really intense about expense control. So yes, I think we can think in terms of that I don\u2019t know, you might have projections for '19, I am not doing, its too early, but to concept I am willing to permit is that, I see forward-looking focus on expenses very constant as we head through \u201919. Erika Najarian : Thank you and if I could just slip one more and I really want to hear what you think Kelly. The feds proposal for the stress capital buffer, it seemed to be positive for high dividend paying banks like BB&T and also regional banks like BB&T. And I\u2019m wondering if the stress capital buffer proposal possesses or rather passes as written, has that change how you\u2019re thinking about capital strategy or capital allocation going forward. Thank you. Kelly King : So, I don\u2019t think that changes what we think about because, we capital is under the 2.5 before, that affects some of the big banks to take a lot of risk and much different kind of relation. So, all the math of that there was a change of basically fundamentalist [indiscernible]. So, what you think about our capital is we got to a 10.2, call it common equity tier one, we got a firm center of floor. We really got about 1% that we\u2019re holding in reserve for OCI when we probably will do 250, which we will at some point. So, we really have 9 versus 7.5 and so the debate is can you give back some of that 1.5 as you think about moving forward, we have a lot of discussions about that. We also are very focused on a tangible capital level however and so while I will say there is some opportunity for some additional capital deployment, I'm not ready to commit to that at this point. Operator : Thank you. We will hear next from Stephen Moss with B. Riley FBR. Stephen Moss : Just want to flesh out the loan growth outlook here going forward. Couple of things. Wondering if you could quantify the increase in loan pipeline this quarter? And also, how we should think about loan growth over the next couple quarters? Will it perhaps be a little bit more weighted towards commercial real estate in the near term? And perhaps broader-based in higher in the second half of the year? Kelly King : So, the pipeline is broad-based and frankly it continues to build every quarter. And so, the real key as to the question asked earlier, is when the pipeline turn into loan growth. That said I think that thing a different trying to member called the psychology but I think that's moving so you get the pipeline turn into loan growth. It will be very similar kind of growth composition. However, as you seen today is not going to be slanted more toward to really say, towards anything else with one possible exception that is we have executed a new national CRU strategy, frankly in the Grandbridge platform and I think you know Grandbridge is one of the industry we've been constraining it in the past, in terms of this tradition or GSE kind of strategy, we\u2019ve now opened it up and are very experienced to national strategy which will produce relatively more high season CRU types of assets opportunities, so you may see some lift in CRU to account for different strategy but that\u2019s the strategy versus the market mix, the general market is going to continue to give us broad based loan opportunities as we have experienced. Unidentified Company Representative : The other thing Steve is on the retail side, we sell residential and mortgage so to grow this quarter that will continue and we expect our indirect portfolio to turn in the second quarter it's been running off now for a while and we expect that to starting to grow in the third quarter and so that will be a big difference. And then in our direct retail we are launching some new products that should help that stop running off and they also start to grow later in the year, so I think on retail coupled with the commercial and CRE I think you are going to see much more robust loan growth out of us in the second half of 18. Stephen Moss : That's helpful. And then, you guys have steadily continued to increase your asset sensitivity over the last couple quarters and has showed up in the margin here. Just wondering, should we expect further increases in your asset sensitivity position? And just how to think about the margin over the next several quarters with additional hikes? Unidentified Company Representative : We are a little bit more asset sensitive it feels we are trying to become a little bit more asset sensitive but it's really a function of the assets reported on the books and what happens to funding. So, I would say we will stay asset sensitive and as we move a little bit more about what we are a positive thing. It's hard to call because so many moving parts of what goes on there but we are trying to become a little bit more asset sensitive. Operator : Our next question will come from John McDonald with Bernstein. John McDonald : Just wanted to follow-up on the NIM and the NII Daryl. What led the core and reported NIM to do better than you are expecting this quarter and what are some of the puts and takes for the core NIM to be up next quarter and your outlook? Daryl Bible : So, John, I think the key drivers obviously, is we continue to outperform on deposit betas and deposit betas basically came in were only up 24% in the quarter, we expect that to be higher than that so that was a positive. Our credit spreads that we may have a commercial side, all kind of increased C&I spreads are up, CRE spreads are up, were doing a good job in the retail and so credit spreads seem to be positive, so while the volumes are not showing up yet are spreads that were put on the balance sheet is also a positive as we go forward into the year, we expect right now our forecast has two more rate increases, one in June and the other in September and then we have one in '19, so we should benefit as those occur. And as we become a little bit more asset sensitive, we believe that we will continue to have a positive core growth of the non-interest margin and make some reach outs from growth and reported on gap margin whenever in the year possibly. John McDonald : Could you remind us Daryl, at the current level of betas that you're seeing now, how much does 125 basis point hike. And then what kind of terminal data assumptions are you guys using when you look ahead? Daryl Bible : So, our margin on this past quarter from the December rate hike we would have been up 3 basis points this past quarter we didn\u2019t have the adjustment on the tax-exempt assets because of the corporate tax rate change. So, I would say on a 25 move right now we're seeing 3 basis points expansion in margin plus or minus but it's around three. As far as terminal betas go, I think in our disclosures when you look at the segments it's slice and dice very easy to see. So, on the retail side right now our beta is about 10% that will continue to climb overtime, but that's still going to stay really, really low versus historical pieces. On the middle market commercial areas those betas during the mid-40s today they are probably going to continue to go up maybe 50 plus that\u2019s about right. And then on the more rate sensitive that you see in our corporate and wealth areas were 65 and that's probably going to go in the 70s. So, we are too far away from terminal betas on the two later segments that we have, but it's the retailers is what's and a lot lower. Operator : Our next question will come from [Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank] Unidentified Analyst : I was wondering if it's possible to parse on the loan growth, how much lift you might get from new products or the expansion for example, into the [near prime auto], just those efforts collectively I guess the home equity and I think there's one or two other you mentioned as well, but how additive you think that could be as you think it about loan growth picking up in the back half the year overall? Kelly King : So, Matt, this is not an exact science but, in our forecast, I would say that we are going to have more growth. If we grow call it, 2% to 3% range for rest of the year, call it, we are probably going to have a commercial and CRE be in the 4 to 6% range. And then the retail areas, including the RESI mortgage portfolios probably be in the 1% to 3% range. If you look at it that way, and we are split about 50-50 from that if that helps. Unidentified Analyst : And then I guess just how meaningful you think some of these expansion efforts or however you wanted to deploy that. I mean obviously auto is not a new product but is a new target customer. How big can some of those efforts be as you think out I don\u2019t know four years or so. Chris Henson : Matt, it's Chris. Near-prime, kind of tough for us as three or four years out. I mean it's already just out of the box in a couple of months, 30 million 40 million a month. So, I think it can continue to grow. Where it goes is tough to call, honestly depends a lot on kind of the auto market, et cetera. But what it does for us is it provides a real feeling for a void that we've had. And we are already talking to both sides prime and so on. So, it really is a pretty quick start up. The other thing I will mention is, I did mention before that business we moved from a flat B to dealer retention which is also had a nice part. We started that really at the end of March and we are only probably two thirds, three quarters through taking that back to the dealership. So that's also going to have a nice boost for us, and we had very, very good receptivity. All that is a good drive. The home equity loan in the branch is something we used to have before QM, back in 2014 and frankly we are just putting it back end or forcing the back end with all it\u2019s a product we did for years that could be substantial for years it was substantial. And we think that we get a run rate back there that [indiscernible]. How to quantify kind of hard to know. Kelly King : But in conceptually I\u2019d say that if you think about our growth going forward about half of the lift will be from I\u2019d say the broad-based market, the traditional execution, the regions excreta, and about half of the lift will be the improvement of the optimizing portfolios, the new products initiatives that Chris talked about. All of that road together will be about half, because we got a lot of new stuff happening, so that number is will be those exposure we thinking it more in the 2 to 3% kind of number but we\u2019re not counting on the whole market lifting, we\u2019re assuming the markets can be, may not delivers the markets as more an even great but we are putting all these initiatives and make sure that we cover ourselves into bit more what we hope that we get. Chris Henson : And I didn\u2019t even comment on our full-service growth has gotten [indiscernible] to work together to move in the markets commensurate much like we have corporate for the last three or four years. Going in the Cincinnati Fort Worth Texas national and Tampa and both of those businesses have revenues that are up 15% pretax income of 30% if we run right now. We got a really good momentum as we kind of move to these markets. Operator : Our next question will come from Ken Houston with Jefferies. Amanda Larsen : This is Amanda Larsen on for Ken. Can you talk about deposit growth and overall balance sheet size as we progress through \u201918, I think average deposits were down 3% year-over-year and you tipped down '18 loan growth guidance modestly? Do you see a similar amount of average earnings asset growth and some improvement in deposit growth rates? Kelly King : I think its real important to manage and you know that, as our loan growth or deposits will grow, they are really a cash that they have and we really try to manage that process, so that if we start getting more growth on the lending side, we\u2019re going to have more core deposit growth. We\u2019re doing a great job just attracting transaction accounts. Chris mentioned that all the digital marketing efforts and the account growth initiatives that we have going on with our retail and corporate areas and we\u2019re getting great growth in our net account growth there. So that\u2019s going to continue. And then on the margin, we\u2019re starting to finally grow our CD deposits and those have been growing for a long time, they actually grew this quarter on a core basis. So, as rates go up we\u2019re able to track some growth there, that helping our asset sensitivity as positive. So, I would say I would plan, for deposits to grow in sync with the loan growth that we\u2019re going to have. Amanda Larsen : Okay and therefore average earning assets also grow in '18. Kelly King : I mean average earning assets will rose as those growth, I mean that\u2019s the function as more successful in growing loans, it\u2019s going to drive earning assets. Investment portfolio will not be a growth opportunity for us, it might be flat to down from that perspective. We really just want to optimize the earning assets that we have on our balance sheet and our returns and really drive profitability in the company. Amanda Larsen : Okay and them you talk about the systems outage, what exactly cause there and what you learn from going to the experience of having outage? Are you thinking about infrastructure spending any differently, given your improved expense outlet for \u201918, I would assume your plans have not changed but if you can give us some detail on the thought process there that would be helpful? Kelly King : While the system average was a significant event in terms of some client impact, I will remind you however that its fairly short duration, it happened on a Thursday afternoon and about Friday afternoon, we are basically up and running. It took a little bit longer for some of the wrinkle to work out but it was a very short event. It was a very simple but serious equipment malfunction, it was new equipment and it was just unfortunate event, of course it went over a couple of days later and examined it myself. I'm not going to get into detail because the discussions that are going it may from discussing the exact detail but I would tell you that it was a very simple thing that should called no alarm with regard to our infrastructure in terms of IT and its resiliency and its redundancy. in fact, we have are just finishing a 300 million new datacenter that has a duplicate redundant data house which is where this occurred.  So, we have already made the investment for the high level of resilience and redundancy. So, there's no additional investment required to respond to that event because the cost structure was already built into place and the event occurred because some of the investments that we made were not fully executed on where they should have been.  The learning from that is and record to all the parties that are involved in these new big investments. There will be mistakes made and the only thing you can do is to increase your focus in terms of managing the risk around that and checking and double checking. I use the analogy at the Board and maybe to help you, it's kind of buying a new car and I hate to buy a new car, I am still driving a 2001 Lexus with 140,000 miles, because I hate buying new cars but every time you buy a new car, you got to go through about three months of working out all the wrinkles. And so, it's fine when you look to the wrinkle both are hassle going through the wrinkles. And that\u2019s just kind of what you get a little bit up here it's a 300 million great high quality new investment that we made dramatically improves our capability for our clients our resilience our redundancy reduces our risk and it's just that simple. Operator : Our next question will come from Brian Klock with Keefe Bruyette Woods. Brian Klock : I just wanted to follow-up on two things one, Kelly you mentioned that 2019 is a little bit further out, but you did say that it is possible to have flattish to downish expenses in '19 how should we think about that including full-year of operations of their regions and insurance acquisition of those operations or is it a core. Kelly King : No that includes that. Brian Klock : And a follow-up on kind of that insurance business and the potential impact on capital. I guess, is there any disclosures or give us an idea of what kind of a purchase price, you might have paid or what kind of impact it could have on the intangibles created from that deal. Daryl Bible : We do not disclose the terms of the transaction, we don\u2019t view it as significant number and it feels that we are going to basically all of our guidance incorporates the revenue and expense that we gave and it's going to impact some of our buyback in the third quarter. Kelly King : It\u2019s a situation where [indiscernible] you want to stay active in the future and compete with private equity and it's just sort of at least stay that way. Operator : Our next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Okay. So just to make sure I understand on the acquisition piece the revenue, expenses, that's in the guidance that you already gave for the full year 2018, because it's going to hit in the 3Q right, is that correct? Kelly King : Yes, we planned to close it early third quarter. Betsy Graseck : And then I guess the only reason I was getting asked a lot because it does have some impact on the buyback but is this smaller than a breadbasket impact or is this hey, we should take the buyback out in 3Q? Kelly King : Hey, Betsy, do you want Daryl to have to repeat exactly what he just said? Betsy Graseck : Depends on what you want your EPS to look like. Kelly Stuart : You know our bank very well Betsy you figure it out. Betsy Graseck : And then just lastly when you were mentioning about how the competition with PE et cetera. Do I sense a tone from that on hey, there is other opportunities in insurance brokerage as well and that because I thought there was a little bit of a slowdown in the acquisitions and insurance brokerage, but I'm wondering if the conversation that we just been having suggest that we should see more in the coming quarters? Kelly King : Yes, we have had for years sort of our CapEx really 20% this gets us to 17% and 17.5%. So, it kind of does what we need to do there is no real need for us to do anything other significant. If there was a small something that had a product there is small geography that made sense. But there is no real reason for us to do anything. We are fifth largest in the U.S. and the world as it is. I think our focus is really improve the profitability in the business as we said. Betsy Graseck : So, what it the footprint that regions had gave you because there is some overlap there already but I know they extend into more of the central area of the country and upper Midwest was that a geography that you didn't have before? Or what was it they had that you could benefit from? Kelly King : Yes, there is 10 states, we overlap in six. We did not have Arkansas, Louisiana, we had a little bit Indiana but the biggest is Arkansas Louisiana. They bought the largest agencies in those markets. So, we go in with substantial, kind of opportunity there. They were also in parts of Tennessee we were in Memphis and so those are meaningful to us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen that will conclude our question-and-answer session for today's call. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference back over to Alan Greer for any additional or closing remarks. Alan Greer : Thank you and thanks for everyone for joining us today. I hope you have a good day. This concludes our comments. Operator : Again, that will conclude today's conference. Thank you once again for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our call. We always appreciate your time and attention. So I\u2019d say the second quarter was overall very strong, particularly when you look through all the parts. We had record earnings, record returns, strong revenue, very good expense control, great asset quality and improved loan growth. Net income was record $775 million or up 22% versus second 2017. Excluding mergers, it was the record $792 million. Diluted EPS was $0.99, up 28%. Adjusted diluted EPS was a record $1.01, which was up 29% versus the second quarter. I would point out that if you look at the pre-tax ex-merger earnings, and they are up 6% versus second quarter 2017, which is simply showing that independent of the tax reductions, our business is meaningfully improving. ROA, RO Common Equity and Return on Tangible were 1.49%, 11.74% and 19.78% respectively. And I think importantly, if you look at adjusted ROA, ROCE and ROTCE, it was 1.52%, 12.01%, and a very strong 20.2% on Return on Tangible. Importantly, we did achieve positive operating leverage in the second. And also quarterly revenue totaled $2.9 billion, which was up 9.2% annualized compared to the first, that was insurance seasonality, but it\u2019s still a very strong revenue quarter. Loans held for investment did perform very, very well, up 3.5%. So we\u2019re seeing the turn that we have been expecting over the last two, three quarters. Net interest margin increased 1 basis point to 3.45%. And our core was up 2 basis points to 3.34%, and a strong fee income ratio of 42.5%, which was up from 41.9% in the first quarter. Adjusted efficiency ratio was 57.4% versus 57.3%, so about flat. Adjusted noninterest expenses totaled $1.6 billion, which was a decrease of 2.1% versus 2017. I\u2019m very pleased with our expense discipline. I would say to you that our flat guidance for the year, remember, includes Regions, so it is net down, which is I think very good, when you hear in a minute and I\u2019ll talk about a lot of different things we are doing. Credit quality was just great. NPA ratio was 0.28%, decrease of 2 basis points. Charge-offs were 30 basis points versus 41 basis points in the first, and 37 basis points in second last year. So great credit quality. If you\u2019re following along, I\u2019m on Page 3. In terms of strategic highlights, I would point out, we did close the Regions Insurance deal, which is a really attractive deal we closed out on July 2, great addition from both a cultural and market perspective. Strengthened our presence in many Southeastern markets, and importantly, expanded into new markets in Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana and Indiana. In our capital plan, we did not have a fed objection. We have an 8% increase in quarterly dividend planned on top of the 13.6% increase that we did in the first quarter. And up to $1.7 billion in share repurchases. Some of that we used in the Regions acquisition. But if you look at the combination of the first and the projected third quarterly dividend increase, it\u2019s up 22.7% from the fourth quarter 2017. We\u2019re maintaining a strong and growing dividend, for our shareholders this is very important and we are executing on that. On Page 4, we just had fairly straightforward selected items, mostly related to real estate losses, and closing branches, and back-room facilities. That was about $0.02 a share. On Page 5, I\u2019ll talk a little bit about loan growth. We\u2019re very pleased that we\u2019re seeing the turn that we\u2019ve been expecting. So we had 3.5% growth in loans, that are very strong in C&I which was up 6.3%. Strong performance in a number of areas, corporate banking, mortgage warehouse lending. Sheffield was up 32% annualized, and that\u2019s seasonal, but still strong. Commercial Equipment Capital was up 16% annualized; Dealer floor plan and the Premium Finance. I\u2019d point out Community Bank was up 3.5%. That\u2019s a big deal, because if you recall over the last several quarters, I\u2019ve been talking to you about how for the last number of years Main Street has been kind of dead in the water and we\u2019ve been expecting it to recover. Well, it is recovering. Optimism is strong. Equipment purchases, other types of acquisitions and purchase are happening. So we\u2019re really pleased to see Community Bank. That\u2019s an engine for our company. CRE is up 2.8% annualized. And that\u2019s very, very strong. I would also point out that our end-of-period loans are up $3 billion, greater than end-of-period loans for the first quarter, which is 9% annualized. Our auto portfolio made the turn in the quarter as we expected. Our mortgage loans grew on average as we expected. So really both the optimizing portfolios have now turned and that will be a positive push in terms of total loan growth as we go forward. So when we think about loan growth, I\u2019ll get Daryl talk about the guidance in a little bit. But I personally think that loan growth should be in plus or minus 4% as we go into the third, barring any major changes in the economy. If you look at Page 6, in terms of deposits, it was a healthy quarter for us. I\u2019m very pleased that our noninterest-bearing deposits or DDA growth we were at 4.3%. That\u2019s very strong compared to the industry and reflects a lot of our [inner growth] [ph] strategies that are really paying dividends now. Our noninterest-bearing deposits grew very strongly, increased $567 million. Percentage of noninterest-bearing deposits increased to 34.2%. I do want to make a comment about betas, So cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.57%, up 11 basis points or a 41% implied beta. I would just comment to you that that was a beta outside maybe what you expected, but we have frankly a few markets that we were getting some outsized competition, and we made a conscious decision to react in those markets. That\u2019s not a kind of normalized beta increase that was more of marketing strategic change. So I would expect that betas to lower from that level, Daryl will give you a commentary on that, but I would expect to see that lower. So I know that looked a little outside to you, but that\u2019s why that is. I want to make just a comment for turn out to Daryl in terms of the economy, in general, what we are seeing out there, it\u2019s really very positive and very strong. I\u2019ve just completed 23 of our 24 regional visits. As you know I go out and spend a whole day in the region, I did two of them last week. When I talk to business CEOs, they are very optimistic, they are spending and planning the spend on CapEx, interestingly competitions hitting up, beta is facing intense wage pressure and difficulty in finding the people that they need. One construction CEO told me that in certain cases, he was having to raise prices 25% to get the kind of people that he made it. So not take away from there from an economic perspective is we can expect higher inflation and higher rates. There is no incongruent information out there, contrary to that. So I think that\u2019s most likely as we look forward, which is good news for the economy and good news for banks. I am going to comment a little bit later on some of our key strategies, that I think very important in your view of how it\u2019s going to be for BB&T. But for right now, let me let Daryl give you more color in terms of more of the numbers. Daryl Bible : Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I am excited to talk about our excellent credit quality, improving margins and loan growth, strong expense control, and our guidance for third quarter and full year 2018. Turning to Slide 7, credit quality remains very strong, net charge-offs totaled $109 million, down 11 basis points. We had improvement across most loan categories, but indirect loan charge-offs drove most of the decline. Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing as a percent of loans and leases decreased 4 basis points from both link and like quarters. Loans 30 to 89 days past due increased 5 basis points due to seasonality and 1 basis point from a year ago. The NPA ratio was 28 basis points and matched the lowest level since 2006. We saw declines in nonperforming assets in most categories. Continuing on Slide 8, our allowance coverage ratios remained strong at 3.49 times for net charge-offs and 2.74 times for NPLs. The allowance to loans ratio was 1.05% flat from last quarter. We recorded a provision of $135 million compared to net charge-offs of $109 million. The provision was $26 million higher. The net charge-offs contributing to a flat allowance to loans ratio with period ended loans up more than $3 billion from March 31. Turning to Slide 9. The reported net interest margin was 3.45%, up 1 basis point. Core margin was 3.34%, up 2 basis points. Both increases reflect asset-sensitivity and higher short-term rates. The deposit beta for this quarter was 41% slightly less than our modeled about 50% beta. In addition to the index accounts repricing this quarter, deposit costs were impacted by many rate specials and many of our markets, we expect this to abate in the next quarter. Since 2015, our cumulative deposit beta has been 24%. Asset-sensitivity decreased due to changes in our loan mix and deposit mix offset by the decline in the investment portfolio. Continuing on Slide 10, our fee income ratio was 42.5%, up slightly mostly due to seasonality. Noninterest income totaled $1.2 million, insurance income was up $45 million, mostly due to the seasonal increase in P&C commissions. We don\u2019t expect prior year storms and other events to significantly impact profit based commissions for the rest of this year. On July 2, Insurance Group acquisition will benefit insurance income starting the third quarter. Keep in mind that insurance income is seasonally lower in the third quarter. Service charges on deposits return to normal levels following last quarter\u2019s system outage. Mortgage banking income declined $5 million primarily due to gain-on-sale margins declined 30 basis points mostly due to retail originations. Investment banking and brokerage income declined $4 million mostly due to deal timing. Turning to Slide 11. The adjusted expense came in just under $1.7 billion or up $38 million. Personnel cost increased $35 million due to annual merit increases and the increase in performance-based incentives. FTEs declined 126. The initiative to reduce the amount of space continues to have a positive impact on occupancy and equipment expense down $7 million. About 740,000 square feet of BB&T occupied space has been vacated since January. Other expenses were up $12 million mostly due to the increase in the Visa indemnification reserve, which was not expected. Merger-related and restructuring charges were down $4 million, nearly all these costs were related to real estate losses due to our branch closing strategy. Expenses were include the impacted Regions Insurance acquisition starting in the third quarter. Well-controlled expenses contributed positive operating leverage versus second quarter of 2017. Continuing to Slide 12. Our capital, liquidity and payout ratios remain strong. The approved capital plan includes a dividend increase and share repurchases. Our $2.9 billion capital plan is similar to what we did last year, we did more heavily towards dividend payout. The 7.5% dividend increase represents a cumulative 22.7% increase since the fourth quarter 2017. The Regions Insurance acquisition will impact third quarter share buyback. Now let\u2019s look at our segment results beginning on Slide 13. Community Banking Retail and Consumer Finance net income was $377 million. The $53 million improvement was driven by balance sheet growth, improving deposit spreads, seasonal increase in card-based fees and deposit service income offsetting the negative impact from the February system outage. Residential mortgage originations were up 17%. The production-based mix was 77% purchase and 23% refi and the gain-on-sale margin was 1.40% versus 1.72% last quarter. We closed 80 branches and plan to close about 85 more later this year. This strategy continues to help us controlled expenses and provide more funds to invest in our businesses. Continuing on Slide 14. Average loans increased $721 million driven by residential mortgage and the seasonal pickup in the mortgage warehouse funding. As expected the auto portfolio stabilized and we expected to grow going forward. Deposit balances increased $983 million when growth in both DDA and CDs. The deposit beta was 19%. Turning to Slide 15. Community Banking commercial net income was $277 million, a $7 million increase was mainly due to improving deposit spreads. The commercial pipeline was up compared to both link and like quarter. Continuing on Slide 16, average loan balances were up $268 million, growth in C&I construction loans were partially offset by the decline in income producing property loans. End of period loans grew 4.4% annualized. Competitive pressures on loan repricing remain as we saw a decline in loan spreads. Deposits were down $203 million due to decline in public fund deposits, which was partially offset by increases in commercial deposits. The deposit beta was about 67%. Turning to Slide 17. Financial Services and Commercial Finance net income was $145 million, driven by loan growth and improving deposit spreads. This was offset by slower fee income due to the timing of investment banking deals and an increase in an incentive-based compensation. Continuing on Slide 18. Average loans were up $292 million and deposits were flat. Corporate Banking, Wealth and Grandbridge all showed good loan growth. Interest-bearing deposits were up 20 basis points and a beta of 74%. Turning to Slide 19. Insurance Holdings and Premium Finance net income totaled $73 million. The $11 million improvement was driven by seasonality in P&C commissions, partially offset by the related increase in incentive-based compensation. Like quarter organic growth was up 5.2% mostly due to a 15% increase in new business. Our Regions Insurance acquisition will add about $70 million in revenue for the second half of this year. And the EBITDA margin for the second half of 2018 will be about 20%. Turning to Slide 20, you will see our outlook. For the second quarter, we met all of our guidance except for noninterest income, which we talked about publically last quarter. This is mostly due to mortgage. Investment banking was also a little soft this quarter, due to the timing of some of the deals closing. Looking to the third quarter, we expect loans to be up 2% to 4%, annualized link. Our guidance has improved in light of the quarter\u2019s performance and strong momentum, such that the high-end of the range plus or minus 4% looks promising. Net charge-offs to be in a range of 35 to 45 basis points, the loan-loss provision to match net charge-off plus loan growth. The build this quarter is the result of strong end-of-period loan growth, which positions us well for future quarters. The GAAP and core margin to be up slightly, fee income to be up 3% to 5% versus like-quarter. Seeing deals close already in investment banking this quarter, gives us more confidence that we\u2019ll be at the higher end of this range. Expenses to be up 1% to 3% versus like-quarter and an effective tax rate of about 20%. For the full year 2018, we expect loans to grow in the 1% to 3% range, taxable-equivalent revenues are expected to be up 1% to 3%. The decline from previous annual guidance reflect slower mortgage banking income growth. Expenses are expected to be flat. This is a bit higher due to the FDI surcharge, which was added back into the fourth quarter and an effective tax rate for the year of 20% to 21%. We continue to feel confident that revenue growth along with flat noninterest expenses will result in positive operating leverage for the full year 2018. In summary, we had quarterly earnings, positive operating leverage, very strong credit quality and excellent expense control. Now, let me turn it back over to Kelly for additional comments. Kelly King : Thanks, Al. So, as you just heard, Daryl summarized very well the overall integrated very positive results for the quarter. But I\u2019m going to talk to you a minute or two about what\u2019s really important. I mean, focusing on what\u2019s going on every quarter and the detail of quarter is interesting. So much more importantly, it\u2019s key is what do we do and as we look forward for the future of this company for our shareholders and our other constituencies. So we are working very, very hard on what I\u2019ve been calling for several quarters our Disrupt-or-Die strategy. You can see that in a graph on Page 21. We laid it out in terms of disrupt or die to simply to get our own people\u2019s attention, because the world is really changing. It\u2019s changing really, really fast. It\u2019s going to continue to change at a more rapid pace. I think AI, machine learning, digital, all of the various comos [ph] we all know about are real. And so, we are very, very seriously focusing on the front-room and the back-room of our businesses, focusing on reconceptualization and figuring out how to operate our businesses more efficiently and more effectively. For example, right now and this has been in place for a number of weeks. We\u2019ve already got major projects going on in terms of reconceptualizing operations in our whole IT area, think Agile and DevOps and all of the things that go to that. Our insurance business is going through a top to bottom reconceptualization process, incorporating the Regions Insurance acquisition. And we expect substantial improvement in our insurance business as a result of that. We have major projects going on in reconceptualizing our Commercial and Retail banking and the Community Bank. Just to give you a couple of anecdotes, so for example, we have a project going on right now that will reduce the turnaround time in making a small business loan from 28 days to 3 days. That\u2019s really, really important stuff in terms of making it more convenient and easy for our clients, in terms of our branches, auto loan business. By the end of this year, we will have our loan approval time down from 1.5 days to 4 minutes. This is big stuff. This will change the business. As Daryl pointed out, we\u2019ll be closing like 160 branches this year to be able to reinvest in other aspects of our branch system and other aspects of the bank. In our commercial area, we are working on a project that will evaluate and improve performance from end to end, that\u2019s from the beginning of the request, all the way through the final booking of the loan. We\u2019re considering and are very likely soon going to start a major project on general expenses including things like layers of management \u2013 you can see we\u2019re looking top to bottom every aspect of the company, because we simply have to reinvest in the future of the business. That you know, it\u2019s basically an online banking business that we and everybody else has, we have to protect that, but at the same time we have to streamline it and harvest expenses out of that old bank and reinvest it into new bank. And it needs to be focused primarily on client interaction and relationship management. So what are we doing? We are developing right now an entirely new ATM strategy. We have an substantially improved retail product line, for example, we just introduced last couple of weeks five new credit cards, feedback from the field is fantastic. We are encouraging and really kind of pushing our market leaders, our branch managers to be out making calls in the market three times per day, which is a dramatic improvement. We have in the retail and the commercial side a new program we called Financial Insights. This is a big deal. So historically, we and other banks have gone out called on clients to ask about the loans and deposits from fee income, we don\u2019t do that anymore. We go out and talked our clients about their dreams, their goals, their hopes in life. What are their financial plans? And we particularly focus on talking to them about their leadership, because we believe everything starts and stops around leadership, and so if we can help our clients and prospects improve their leadership, we know they will do better that\u2019s a good thing, and then in return we will do better. We focus on helping them grow their business. Inherently we get more loan deposits and fee income. We have a number of things on the marketing support side that are really big deal. We have a new program called Voice of the Client. Historically, we were basically only be able to give our people in the branches and other parts of the bank feedback about once a year. This Voice of the Client is essentially a real time feedback. So if a brand \u2013 a person comes out of a branch in Dallas, Texas today within a day or so [delayed you] [ph] sometimes the same day that banker and their bankers\u2019 supervisor and all the way up to me, we know exactly whether it was good or bad, our interaction. If it was good, we pat them on the back, if it\u2019s bad we coach them in terms of how to improve. We set up a new program called Cloud First solutions, when we are looking diligently continuously on how we can improved our business to make it easier, simpler, faster and more secure for our clients. This year-to-date, backroom has uncovered 32 clients. And hence, we just instituted a couple of months ago a virtual banking center. So that when our clients are less likely to come in at the branch, we will be much more active in terms of touching them on a regular basis in the manner they want to be touched from a digital perspective. We\u2019re enhancing our marketing and digital sales, frankly, we are getting fantastic four to five then one paybacks on the investment in those areas, and we are very excited about it. In the Retail Community Bank, we have an agile revenue team that meets once a month, actually, it\u2019s multiple teams. Their challenge is to continuously look for ways to improve what we do, product lineup, the way we deliver any aspect of the business and give it into effect really fast, kind of an agile or kind of approach that\u2019s very, very exciting. And we back all of that up by a much more enhanced focus on client insights and analytics. So the concept is to disrupt the old bank, cut cost, reallocate and await and re-conceptualize the business and it\u2019s working very, very well. Keep in mind that we are investing a substantial portion of those cost reductions, back into the new way. But at the same time, we are holding expenses flat for 2018 and expect to in 2019, that\u2019s a pretty big deal. And that\u2019s what we need to do. So our people working really, really hard to work on all that. But most importantly beyond all that, I will just remind you BB&T will be a little different than some companies. We are intensely focused on why we are here. We believe that when we focus on the fundamental purpose for our organization, we are more effective and more success. Now we make loans, we get deposits and we get fees and all that, but that\u2019s not why we are here. We are here to make the world a better place to live, we are with very serious about that, and that\u2019s why we focus on things like Financial Insights. When we made the world a better place to live by making loans and deposits, et cetera, of course our bank has grown, our shareholder does well. When you get up in the morning and you\u2019re focusing on other people, other companies and doing most best for them, good things in life happen. You get up in the morning, you\u2019re focusing on yourself, how many loans you can make and deposits you will get, and how much \u2013 what\u2019s your personal raise is going to be, what\u2019s your personal bonus is going to be, life doesn\u2019t work out so well. So we are making sure that our culture is consistent across our organization that everybody in our company has to be on the same page in terms of where we are. But that\u2019s a big deal. We can talk to you more about that when we have our Investment Day. So I just wanted to mention to you, if you look at the Page 22, on our deck, we are having our Investor Day on November 13 and 14 in Greensboro. We\u2019re having it on our new BB&T Leadership Institute. We\u2019re very excited about it. It\u2019s almost $40 million new project, is to sit back and [a nice time for wood setting, balcony quils] [ph]. It has 48 attached rooms. I\u2019ve been to a lot of these leadership programs in different places around the country. This is the best in class. So I\u2019m excited about showing it to you. I hope you will come on the evening of the 13th. We will have a special presentation and show you around the institute. I think you\u2019d be really impressed with it. I will mention that we do have 48 rooms attached to the institute. So the first 48 investors that sign up, you will get to stay in these brand new really nice rooms there at the institute. Of course, there is a nearby really nice hotel for the rest. So we\u2019re looking forward to seeing you in Greensboro on November 13 and spending the next day with you. So with that I will turn it back to Alan and we\u2019ll go to questions. Alan Greer : Okay. Thank you, Kelly. Gail, at this time if you will come back on the line and explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session. Operator : Certainly, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from John Pancari from Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open. John Pancari : Good morning. Daryl Bible : Good morning. Kelly King : Good morning. John Pancari : I want to just ask on the expense side. I know you just indicated that you do expect expenses for the year to be flat. I believe that you had indicated previously flat to down modestly and for the year. Did anything change, is impacting that outlook? And if so, can you give some more color on it? Thanks. Daryl Bible : Yeah, John. This is Daryl. I said in my beginning remarks that we used to have in the fourth the FDIC surcharge coming out. We put that back in. When you look at the diff, the diff numbers from the last two quarters are flat basically. So while there is still a chance it may come out in the fourth quarter, we weren\u2019t sure about that. So we wanted to be conservative to make sure that we were given proper guidance. So if it does come out in the fourth quarter that would be an upside for us. Kelly King : But, John, keep in mind, that that is flat including Regions. And so, our core expenses are still down, including the FDIC [indiscernible]. John Pancari : Okay. All right, I got it. And then, for the loan growth, I know you are \u2013 you just indicated, Kelly, that you feel better that it could reach 4% plus or minus. What is that timeframe for when you think you can get to that level? Is that more of a longer-term thing? And I believe previously you had indicated maybe a longer-term range of 4% to 6%, so I just want to get your thoughts. Kelly King : Yeah, so a plus or minus 4%, John, is for the third. I know we technically showed in our deck 3% to 4%. But I\u2019m just saying based on what I\u2019m see, and as I said, I\u2019ve been to 23 regions, I\u2019ve been to two regions last week. And based on everything I see and talked to our people, I think we got a very good chance. I can\u2019t guarantee it, of course. I think we got a very good chance that it\u2019d be into plus or minus 4% for the third. And then the guidance we\u2019ve given before still stands as we go well beyond that. Daryl Bible : John, the specific categories for the next quarter, we\u2019re seeing \u2013 besides C&I and mortgage, which really helped us this quarter, we\u2019re seeing really good traction in our indirect businesses. in auto and Sheffield, and also credit card. So, all those should get us to that level. John Pancari : Okay. Got it, got it. And then one last thing if I could, on the insurance side, your insurance revenue was flat year-over-year. We had looked for a few percent growth. Can you give us a little bit of more color on the \u2013 what\u2019s impacting that? Daryl Bible : Yeah, sure, John. Keep in mind, a year ago, we had $12 million in performance based commissions that we did not receive because of the storms in the fall. So if you exclude that, really we were up 5.2% core organic growth in the quarter, and so far 4.2% year to date. And we\u2019re seeing actually acceleration in our new business production. First quarter was 11.8%, we were up 15% in the second quarter. I haven\u2019t seen those kind of numbers really in years. So the economic expansion is really helping drive that. And pricing is up in 2%, 2.5%. We see that sort of stabilizing as opposed to sort of down to like it was in the year 2017. So I\u2019d just leave you with that. As a result, we\u2019ve been kind of guiding up 2.5% to 3% in organic growth. And really for the year 2018, what we\u2019re really seeing is up now about, we think we\u2019re going to be up in the 3.5% to 4%. So we\u2019re kind of moving it up 1% if you would. John Pancari : Got it. All right, thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from Jennifer Demba from SunTrust. Please go ahead. Jennifer Demba : Thank you. Good morning. Daryl Bible : Good morning. Jennifer Demba : I have two questions. First, Kelly, could you just talk about your capacity and interest for bank M&A now? And secondly, that the slide \u2013 the Disrupt-or-Die slide on number 21, very helpful \u2013 which strategies on that slide do you think present the most opportunity for BBT over the next couple of years? Kelly King : Yeah, so on the M&A front keep in mind that we\u2019ve been in this pause in terms of M&A. I haven\u2019t officially lifted that pause. But I will be candid with you. I think we\u2019re basically ready to get back in M&A, in terms of our internal capacities. We took this pause, because we needed to make sure we got all these major projects worked and that they are all in really good shape. We\u2019re still in the process of working through the final step with regard to the consent order. You saw we have been released from the consent order with the FDIC in the state. We\u2019re not yet been released with regard to the fed. And we\u2019re working with them on that. I expect that to be released in the not too distant future, but I can\u2019t control that. And so, but I remind you, in any event, at some point that will be released. And there is some possibility in fourth release we can still do M&A. So, I mean, I\u2019m not overly worried about that. The bigger issue is the availability of mergers and the economics. I will tell you that there is a meaningful increase in activity in really just the last couple of months, so we\u2019ve been approached by a number of institutions in the last 60 days that would like to consider a partnership with us. And we\u2019re very humbled by that. We very much appreciate that. And of course, we will look at them. But it\u2019s all about economics. And I\u2019ve said repeatedly that the economics of M&A has changed, because when we talk about this change in terms of digital banking and the change in demand for convenience from our clients, that\u2019s real stuff. And so, we\u2019re seeing declines in the 5%-plus range in terms of branches of the bank. Banks are seeing the same thing. And so, when you particularly price an out-of-market deal, unlike in the past where you would forecast an increasing cash flow and discounted [ag you got with the price] [ph], now you\u2019re forecasting a declining cash flow and [discounting of ag] [ph]. And then the market is really not yet quite caught up with that. They\u2019ll figure it out, but they haven\u2019t quite figured it out yet. So I think odds of us doing out-of-market deals are pretty slim. I think odds of us being on the in-market deals are pretty good. But I know every time I say that, sometimes people say they want to go sell our stock. I\u2019ll tell you, that\u2019s not a smart move, because if we do deals, it will be good for our shareholders. We\u2019re just not going to do stupid deals. We\u2019re not going to do deals that has long-term dilutive economics that makes no sense to our shareholders. So we\u2019re going to look at deals and we\u2019ll do them if it makes economic sense. When we do a deal, you\u2019ll be happy we did the deal. With regard to the Disrupt-or-Die, I appreciate your question on that. I think that\u2019s the most important thing, because that sets up all of the investments and sets up improved EPS and improved stock price as we do M&A. So it all innovates [ph] together. I would say the most immediate substantial impact is the reconceptualizations in the Community Bank. It\u2019s a \u2013 that our guys David Weaver and Brant Standridge are doing substantial changes in terms of the cost structure and reallocation of resources, and the penetration of the market. It\u2019s the big deal. I\u2019d say they follow closely by our IT, reconceptualization which is a complete change top to bottom in terms of how we do that. And then, I\u2019d say followed closely by insurance. And so \u2013 and then a number of all those, but that\u2019s kind of the top three I would say, but all of it together is what\u2019s allowing us to how flat expenses and making these major investments into future of the bank that\u2019s \u2013 I can\u2019t overemphasize how important that is for investors are look at banks. Banks that are out, they\u2019re just cutting expenses, and where they\u2019re nearly are not investing for the future may not have a very bright future. And so we\u2019ve been have a very bright future and we think doing what we\u2019re doing is appropriate. So thanks for the question and that\u2019s when we see it. Jennifer Demba : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Kelly King : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hey, so a couple of follow-ups. One on the reinvesting in the business, very passionate presentation you gave on Page 21, Kelly. The question I have is, have you look out over time and we\u2019re talking two to three, four years, do you think that this has an impact on the expense ratio of the organization or does everything that you\u2019re doing keep pace with the expense ratio to that? Kelly King : Betsy, we\u2019re in a new world. And it\u2019s hard to \u2013 of those who have been around long time, we can think, we just maybe more clearly about historically [indiscernible] what the fact are. When you\u2019re in a whole new world, and you\u2019re trying to develop new understandings of various costs or makes it little harder. So given that, I think we will be able to make the kinds of re-conceptualizations, investing the business and still see a slowdown with pressure on our efficiency ratio. Now insurance businesses are going to be fast and that pushing of the pricing. You know how that works. But when you put all of that together are still see in the short run my target is 55. And I think longer term as revenue kicks up, you can even push a little lower than that. But other next few years, I would be thinking in terms of doing all we doing and still seeing positive operating leverage and downward pressure on the efficiency ratio. Betsy Graseck : Got it. [Technical Difficulty] Kelly King : Betsy, I am sorry, we can\u2019t hear your last question. Daryl Bible : We can\u2019t hear you, Betsy. Kelly King : Betsy, we can\u2019t hear you maybe if you can dial back. We\u2019ll let somebody else and we\u2019ll let you come right back in behind them if you can dial back in. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We have now a question coming from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Amanda Larsen : Hi, this is Amanda Larsen on for Ken. Daryl Bible : Hey, Amanda. Amanda Larsen : How are you doing? Daryl Bible : Good. Amanda Larsen : Can you talk about the balance sheet and liquidity in management strategy here given the expectations that loans will continue to grow. What\u2019s your outlook for deposit growth in mix and what betas are you assuming over the next few quarters? Daryl Bible : Yeah, Amanda, so we are starting to get traction on our loan growth, you saw that this quarter and we\u2019re guiding to have stronger loan growth next quarter and hopefully continuing on from there. So we want to have both oars in the water, so we will and as we start to see deposits also start to grow. I think, we\u2019re still fortunate that our DDA is growing. That is growing not as fast as it was, but it\u2019s still positive. But we are getting growth in our checking as well as MMDA products. In last couple of quarters, we\u2019ve got growth in CDs, we will toggle our deposit growth to match our loan growth the best that we can. As far as deposit betas go, we did see a big spike up in our deposit beta from last quarter from 24 to 41. If you work out it, we had increases both in REIT, consumer, commercial and the wealth in large corporate. Our guess is that, that will moderate this next quarter. We believe that, it will go probably from the low-40s, back into the 30s, as we continue to have more traction and growth in deposits. We\u2019re pretty much, what we see in the pipeline right now, feel that we\u2019re going to have a good deposit growth quarter this next quarter with the size that we see now and that should match really well with the loan growth. But we will continue to monitor that, but I think next quarter or two basis, I think, deposit pressures will abate a little bit. Amanda Larsen : Okay, great. And then, can you talk about your expectation for purchase accounting accretion in now 2H, and your expectations for the extend of decline in 2019, and how that interplays into your NIM expectations for both 2H and 2019? Thank you. Daryl Bible : Yeah, so purchase accounting probably by the end of 2019, you probably won\u2019t even be asking the question where as it continues to follow. Right now, the difference between reported margin and core margins of 11 basis points. We see that contracting probably by the end of 2019 going down to maybe only 4, 5 basis points difference. I think, each quarter that goes by, it\u2019s 1 or 2 basis points GAAP change between the two of them. So it is coming in over that time period, over the next four to six quarters. Did that help? Amanda Larsen : Absolutely. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from John McDonald from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open. John McDonald : Hey, guys. Good morning. Daryl, I wanted to ask on the fee revenue looks like the guidance came down a bit, look like it was 2 to 4 previously 1 to 3 for the year. Is that more of a year-to-date performance or do you expect lower growth in the second half maybe you can talk about the drivers there on the fee revenue side? Daryl Bible : Since half the year is in there, it\u2019s really driven by what we\u2019ve seen in mortgage to date, and quite honestly what mortgage volumes are very strong, spreads continue to be very tight. As Chris mentioned, insurance rebounding, so we should have some nice growth, organic growth on that insurance side to help offset part of that. And then the investment banking, what we believe that is timing, this past quarter we missed our forecast our investment banking, but with the deals that we\u2019ve seen close already this quarter. We feel very confident, investment banking and brokerage have a strong second half of the year. So I think we\u2019re going to have with investment banking, service charges and insurance, a decent and relative strong fee income for the second half of 2018 just with mortgage be a little bit softer. John McDonald : So the timing aside, just to the extent of full year is a little lighter than you might have not coming, and it\u2019s really mortgage as a driver there for the full year? Daryl Bible : Yeah, we went through these cycles many times, when refi volume goes down, there is less volume and people just bid up very competitively, very lower pricing and you see that dramatically in the retail businesses, our strategy just down a lot and I think you\u2019re seeing that across the whole industry. But we are positioned very well, our purchase activity is strong, our producers, originators out there are gaining share. So I think, we are equal to regaining share in the marketplace, it\u2019s just the spreads are tighter. John McDonald : Okay. And then, I\u2019ll follow-up on expenses, you mentioned the FDIC charges, the driver of the change in expense guidance for the full year, if you\u2019re assuming the FDIC surcharge remains. How much is that \u2013 can you just remind us how much that FDIC charges and then how you\u2019re feeling about the ability to generate positive operating leverage on the second half of the year and for 2018? Daryl Bible : So the surcharge was worth $21 million a quarter. I would say, if you look at linked quarter between second and third that\u2019s a tough comp for us just because we have seasonality and some of the fee businesses, insurance and Regions coming in. From the Regions Insurance, we will not get any synergies really in that business until we get through the system conversions. System conversion is scheduled for November of this year. After that, Chris can comment on, but we think margins will go from about 20% up to about 30% over the next year through 2019. So we take margins will rise there. So I would say linked quarter, third quarter challenging in a good run, it\u2019s going to be cause to go either way, but for the half a year, fourth quarter definitely year-over-year for very good that should also have operating leverage there. So I think, we really have a lot of good momentum going on. I basically see revenue growing 2% to 3% and expenses being in flat. That\u2019s kind of the story that we have right now. John McDonald : Okay. Kelly King : Absorbing the expense base of Regions. John McDonald : Got you. Got you. One last thing, guys, when we look at the CECL coming on what\u2019s kind of progress you guys having with the preparations for CECL? Daryl Bible : So if you work at it, there was a good white paper they came out this past week by the bank policy institute. They did a research white paper, and we\u2019ve been talking about CECL now for a couple of years. And it really confirm what we\u2019ve been saying is that, it\u2019s very pro-cyclical, and it\u2019s a major threat to the economic stability and our financial crisis. Greg Bair [ph], their CEO testified in Congress this past week on that. But if you really look at what would came out of the study, which is amazing is that CECL expect that you have perfect knowledge of what\u2019s going to happen, if you look that the economic forecast in 2007, nobody was foreseeing a big recession coming. So if you model in what expectations were, they did this in those white paper and actually doubled the contraction of the recession, if you had CECL in place back 11 and 12 years ago. So I think that\u2019s a huge risk to the country to the economy that people really need to think about it. When you look at CECL, while the economics of lending hasn\u2019t changed accounting has departed from economics. When you frontload all your expenses that impacts earnings and capital. Since we are in the industry where capital is part of an accounting number and it\u2019s part of how we managed the company, you have to pay attention for the accounting piece. So I would say, one foot in economics, one foot in accounting. And the regulators and hopefully FASB will make some modifications before they put a lot of risk into the economy. It\u2019s not good for the term assets, but you see in the consumer portfolios, it\u2019s not good for our portfolios that have higher risk and subprime. So there are lot of negatives out there. Ironically, the way CECL is actually set up, we\u2019re actually seeing less reserves on the commercial side, because you\u2019re actually reserving to the maturity and not really to the expected life of the assets. So the whole economics of the CECL versus accounting has been totally disconnected. John McDonald : Got it. Thanks, guys. Daryl Bible : Yeah. Operator : Your next question is coming from Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Kelly, Good morning, Daryl. Daryl Bible : Good morning. Kelly King : Hey, Daryl. How are you doing? Gerard Cassidy : Good. Kelly, I took with some interest your comments about visiting your different regions of the franchise and talking to your customers particularly the one you highlighted, the construction owner and what they have to do for raising prices. And you\u2019ve been passing on your thoughts about maybe interest rates will go higher than what we are currently forecast by the Fed. So my question is when you guys underwrite your very little rate loans what kind of interest rate assumptions are \u2013 interest rate increases assumptions are using in that underwriting? And second, will you change them or will there go up even higher if you start to see higher inflation? Clarke Starnes : Gerard, this is Clarke. That\u2019s a great question. I think that\u2019s \u2013 we think is something differentiates our approach to CRE lending from others for many years. We don\u2019t underwrite specifically on current cap rates, we always look at stress exit underwriting. So we always look at, at least couple of hundred basis points over the current accrual rate with the floor and our floors been in roughly the 6.5 range, but because of the issue you and Kelly just raised, we\u2019re evaluating whether that for needs to go up or not, so we always try to get ahead and make sure we stress these projects or the potential rate shocks and don\u2019t fool ourselves about how we size the loan. But we certainly see less of that focus by others in the markets, which creates a lot \u2013 we believe oversized new credits in many cases. Gerard Cassidy : Does that make it harder for you guys to compete then, because you\u2019re doing it more conservatively than some of your peers? Clarke Starnes : Absolutely in certain aspects, for example, I will tell you right now is very difficult to compete on a fully stabilized IPP project for what I just said, they tend to have very high sizing based upon trended rents and extrapolation of expenses and low vacancy and so non-recourse. So we\u2019re just not applying there, we think that that\u2019s just too much levered. So we\u2019re doing more C&D, where we have very strong initial equity, guarantees, stress underwriting. So we\u2019re well protected for we believe the risk were taken. So we\u2019re having to pick our positions to play based upon that, but we still think we can compete effectively even that said. Kelly King : Gerard, as you well know, we run the business from a long-term through the cycle perspective. And when we get into this period of the cycle, we always see it, many competitors scrambling for asset growth, very short-term focused. And they\u2019re willing to price and structure, whatever it takes to get growth. That feels good today. But it got to feel so good when the pricing come. So we run through the cycle, so we\u2019re good on both sides. So, yeah, it does make it harder for us today. We work hard around it. We don\u2019t give up. But we\u2019re not going to go out there and make loans at the prices some of these people are making and the structures some people are making just to get loan growth. It\u2019s a fool\u2019s game. Gerard Cassidy : And then as a follow-up question, Kelly, going back to Slide 21, I took with interest how you\u2019re going to increase the national lending business. And I recognize that in equipment finance, mortgage and Sheffield, you\u2019re basically already there. But I\u2019m more interested in the corporate and commercial real estate. When you don\u2019t really have national customer base, I know you have some customers but it\u2019s not in your footprint, how do you avoid adverse selection if you\u2019re going at the national level? Kelly King : Well, you have really good people and you have local knowledge people. So we have a great team headed by Rufus Yates and Cory Boyte. And when we ask them to expand as we have, we give the resources to go into the markets and hire local knowledge people, because we learnt, used it in over the years, somebody can leave one market and send some people on the plane and fly out there to West Coast to make a few loans. It doesn\u2019t work out so well. So our strategy is to domiciled people in the marketplace that have local knowledge. And so, we\u2019re not at a competitive disadvantage in terms of appropriate knowledge. So we will be able to expand. And it\u2019s really just a matter of resource allocation. And we\u2019re allocating more resources there because our people have performed extremely well. Christopher Henson : And, Gerard, this is Chris. I would just add. We have a Grandbridge business, which really is a national business. And it has been for years. And we have people throughout the country today. And so, it\u2019s really about ruthless working with Grandbridge and sort of duplicate what he did on the corporate side and bringing in bank balance sheet lenders to kind of sit alongside the Grandbridge folks, which are really kind of secondary market kind of lenders. And we think that will work really well, to be able to put more on the balance sheet and to be able to do construction type financing that we might not have done in the past as well. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you. Look forward to seeing you in November. Kelly King : You bet. See you then. Daryl Bible : Thank you, Gerard. Operator : Next question is coming from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. Can you hear me? Daryl Bible : Yes, yeah, go ahead. Kelly King : You\u2019re fine. Mike Mayo : Okay. Can you elaborate more on your efficiency guidance? I mean, record EPS, lower guidance for efficiency. So it\u2019s little bit of a disconnect. I know you\u2019ve addressed that. But you\u2019re lowering the range from 100 to 400 basis points of positive operating leverage to 100 to 300 basis of positive operating leverage. And I think what you said is the FDIC benefit you pushed out and it\u2019s a little bit of mortgage softness. Maybe there are some investing in there. That\u2019s still a pretty wide range for just two quarters left. I don\u2019t know if you can be more specific to the 100 to 300 basis points annual positive operating leverage. And I think the reason for the sensitivity to this is you guys didn\u2019t assure efficiency targets a few years ago. Your efficiency did become the worst it\u2019s been for BB&T in a decade. And, look, it\u2019s still good progress. It\u2019s still good efficiency. But it hasn\u2019t been the best efficiency like it once was. So what\u2019s your commitment to that 55% short-term? I guess, can you define short term? Is that maybe in 2020, could it be next year? What\u2019s your commitment and conviction to improving the efficiency since you\u2019re pulling back a little bit your guidance here. Kelly King : So, Mike, I\u2019ll give you on the conceptual and Daryl can give some detail. Our commitment and conviction is absolute. But you just need to remember, Mike, what happened to us. During the \u2013 frankly, during the \u201890s and the 2000s, we were growing really, really fast through mergers. We kind of had to. And we did that well. But in that period of time, we didn\u2019t invest as much as investors expect. Maybe we should have in the back-room. So as we headed into the last 10 years, we simply had to substantially ramp up our investment in updating a number of our systems like our \u2013 in our new accounting system, our new commercial loan system, our new data center, and a long list of other systems. So we had them accelerated, I\u2019d say three or four year period of substantial ramp-ups. I told our people at that time, I told the market at that time that it would drive our efficiency ratio up. But it would start to subside. That\u2019s exactly what happened, it popped up. So 59.5% is our goal on an adjusted basis. It\u2019s now down to about 57.3%. And it\u2019s moving on a trajectory as we projected in the 55-ish% kind of range. Obviously, the denominator matters, and we talked about that in the past. But denominator aside, it\u2019s somewhat neutralized, yeah, I feel good about that, being able to make all the investments we\u2019re making and moving towards that 55-ish% kind of target, because we are really figuring out some unique ways to do our business better. I mean, this isn\u2019t just about trying to work hard or do what you did, just working a little harder. This is about working smarter. And this business today, that\u2019s required. And the good news is there are substantial new tools, think AI, machine learning, robotics, et cetera, that we\u2019ve never had before. And so, yeah, we\u2019re confident and excited about it. Daryl Bible : Okay. So little detail, Mike, you want to focus on the things that we can control. So, on the expense side we\u2019ve been doing a great job this year on controlling expenses. If you look at our FTEs, year-over-year we\u2019re down 1,600 FTEs. And we haven\u2019t missed a beat in how we\u2019re operating our company. As that goes forward, I would expect our FTEs also to continue to be right-sized going into the future. As Kelly mentioned, in the branches, we\u2019re rationalizing the branch system. We also have a big program within our back-office facilities. We\u2019re just starting some testing and learning in the front-office facility. So when we started this venture, we have about \u2013 had about 21 million square feet in the company. Right now, we\u2019re about 18.5 million. And that continue to come down. We\u2019ll probably on the next two to three years, everything else being equal, will be close to 16 million square feet, maybe a little bit better than that. We\u2019re going to use those costs as Kelly said, redeploy them in robotics and digital, help drive revenue, while continuing to drive costs, all that comes together. So if we can continue to keep cost flat and continue to make investments, we feel that based on the economy, revenue could be 1% or 2% or it could be 3%, 4%, 5%. We will get what we can within our risk appetite, but we will definitely generate positive operating leverage. Mike Mayo : And then one follow-up, since mergers have impacted the efficiency and, Kelly, I agree with you. Since Southern National mergers absolutely have propelled outperformance by BB&T. We\u2019re talking several decades. So if you look at your stock price versus peers or the S&P, absolutely. But the deals most recently in Pennsylvania, I\u2019m not so sure they helped. And I think you talked about fishing \u2013 I think I was triggered when Daryl said, as oars are in the water, because your fishing analogy, if the fish aren\u2019t biting on one side of the boat, well, maybe you catch the fish on the other side. So I think in-market deals are better received than out-of-market deals. So what additional confidence can you give us that if BB&T were to pursue acquisition, it\u2019d be more like the 25-year record than say the stock price performance after the Pennsylvania deal? And also, if you can define \u2013 you said a meaningful increase in activity. If you could define activity, it\u2019s not like we\u2019ve actually seen a lot of deals, so what does that mean? Kelly King : Yeah, so I think I would generally agree, Mike, with your assessment of the last 25 years with one caveat. When you peg it to the Southern National thing, that\u2019s a lofty peg; that was the most effective MOE in the entire country. We were 10, they were 9. We were all over each other. I think we got to call 50%. I mean, it was a sweetheart deal. Comparing that to Pennsylvania is apples and oranges, it might even been apples and turtles. And so, you can\u2019t really make that comparison. But, yeah, Pennsylvania was not as attractive as Southern National, but it was very attractive. Now, has it gone a little slower than I expected? Yes. But I\u2019ll tell you, Mike, it\u2019s \u2013 they have really turned. I mean, I was up there two times last week. In fact, it was really turned. It\u2019s a stable kind of market. Again, it\u2019s not go-go market like Atlanta or Dallas, stable kind of market, particularly where we are, Mercer, and Lancaster, and Allentown, and that area. So it takes you a little longer. But when you get there, it\u2019s a really good place to be. So \u2013 and remember, those were done right at the beginning of the substantial change in terms of economics around digital acceptance. So as we go forward, the kind of stock price impact, EPS impact, et cetera, that we had historically on deals, I think is what you would expect going forward. And so, you do fish on the side of boat where the fish are. But sometime the fish on the side of boat that are biting aren\u2019t the kind of fish you want. And so, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to say about out-of-market. Yeah, there are a lot of fish out there for us on that side of the boat today. Out-of-the-market is just that the price didn\u2019t go to work. But in terms of the activity, we had four pretty attractive candidates approach us in the last 60 days. We haven\u2019t yet gone back down sort of looking yet, because I think we\u2019re a preferred acquirer. So we\u2019re going to have \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, go ahead. Mike Mayo : Last short follow-up, so what size? Are these tadpoles? Are these sharks? I\u2019m not a big fisherman, but what size deals you guys are looking for here? Kelly King : Well, they\u2019re couple of \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t call them tadpoles, I\u2019d call them little growm [ph]. But they\u2019re a couple of little growm [ph]. But \u2013 so we wouldn\u2019t be particularly interested in them. But we \u2013 but there are some that are good size catfish. I\u2019m not a fisherman either, Mike. But let me be more specific. I\u2019m thinking kind of our minimum target area is $20 billion and we really kind of like $30 billion more than $20 billion. So the days are the \u2013 you know all those deals we used to do, Mike, you remember they were two $500 million. [I\u2019m very familiar in all those days] [ph]. Those days are gone. So it\u2019s more like $20 billion to $30 billion today up to, say, $50 billion. Mike Mayo : All right, thank you. Kelly King : Yeah. Operator : We will now take a final question from Saul Martinez from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Kelly King : Good morning. Operator : Mr. Martinez? Saul Martinez : Hello, hello. Kelly King : Hello. Daryl Bible : Hello. Saul Martinez : Hello, can you hear me? Kelly King : Yeah, go ahead. Daryl Bible : Yes. Saul Martinez : Sorry about that. I didn\u2019t hear that I was called. Hey, I just wanted to come full circle on the discussion on deposit betas and then make sure I understand the logic. So, obviously, you\u2019re expecting it to tick down from the 41% this quarter into the 30%-plus range. Having said that, the cumulative beta has been about 24%. I think you mentioned that you\u2019re modeling about 50%. And frankly, 41% doesn\u2019t seem that high given where we are in the cycle, in the tightening cycle right now. So how do we think about the progressions, just say, beyond the next couple of quarters? Do we see a bit of a downtick, both as we progress in the interest rate cycle and get closer to whatever the terminal fed fund rate is? Where do you see the incremental deposit beta tracking to and how do we think about sort of the cumulative deposit beta in this cycle? Kelly King : So I think what we\u2019re trying to convey is that we had a spike up in the second that was part the market itself, but a substantial part of our own strategic decisioning to respond to some market conditions. That part will subside as we head into the third and the fourth. Now, if we continue to see substantial increases in rates, and if corporations continue to use their available cash, which they\u2019re doing today, and there is more demand for lending, lending pace goes up. There will be more demand for \u2013 I mean, more demand relative to just flat for funding and that will drop betas. So my own personal view is it will \u2013 for us, it will subside, I mean, in next couple of quarters. And then depending on what happens, the rates will move slowly, more naturally tick up, because you\u2019re right. I mean 41% in and of itself is not inherently bad. It\u2019s just that it popped up real fast and we want to try to explain why it popped up real fast. You would expect it to gotten it out little more over a several quarter kind of period. Daryl Bible : Yeah, if you look historically in bad cycles it\u2019s been between 40% and 60% deposit beta. Right now, our cumulative number is 24%. I don\u2019t see it getting over 50% cumulatively. It\u2019s going to be at the low-end of that range. But as Kelly said, once we have abated it in the next quarter or two, it will probably gradually grow up. It will probably stay in the lower end of that range going forward. Saul Martinez : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Got it. And then just a quick follow-up on Regions, have you disclosed or given a sense of what the magnitude is of how much the acquisition could impact your buyback in 3Q? Daryl Bible : We have a \u2013 best take right now, we\u2019ll probably buy back about $200 million of shares this quarter, and then as depending on the size of the balance sheet. We communicated to the marketplace last quarter that we want our capital ratios to have a CET1 that\u2019s over 10%. The reason we\u2019re doing that is that if we cross over $250 billion over the next couple of years, we have the AOCI risk that goes through our numbers. And right now with higher interest rates. The capital hit with our portfolio and pension that we have out there is about 100 basis points. So our CET1 would fall when you cross over $250 billion from, call it, 10% to 9% on day-one once you cross over. So that will probably, the long answer to it, we won\u2019t probably spend all the $1.7 billion that we ask for. Some of that was used up with the Regions Insurance acquisition and some of it we won\u2019t be able to spend just because we want to keep it over 10%. But it really depends on how much our balance sheet grows and how fast. We will update every quarter, what we\u2019re looking to buy, repurchase in the earnings call. But right now for this quarter, I\u2019d say about $200 million. Saul Martinez : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks a lot. Daryl Bible : Yeah. Operator : That will conclude today\u2019s conference call. I would like now to turn the call back to our host for any additional or closing remarks. Alan Greer : Okay. Thank you, Gail. And thanks to everyone for joining us. I apologize to the questioners in the queue that we didn\u2019t have time to get to. And we will call you later today. Thank you and I hope everyone has a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you very much for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Good morning, everybody, and thank you very much for joining our call. Hope you\u2019re having a great morning so far. We had a great quarter with record earnings driven by strong revenue, broad-based loan growth and solid expense control. Now \u2013 for now, we continue to execute on numerous strategies, which are creating more diversified and resilient profitability. And at the same time, we are investing substantially in our digital platform, which creates outstanding client experience. Net income was a record $789 million, up 32% versus third quarter 2017. Net income, excluding merger-related restructuring charges, was a record $802 million. Very pleased that quarterly fully tax equivalent revenue was $3 billion, up 7.1% annualized compared to the second quarter of 2018, largely due to Regions Insurance, net interest income and investment banking. Our diluted EPS was a record $1.01, up 36.5% versus the third quarter 2017 and adjusted EPS was also a record at $1.03, up 32% versus third quarter 2017. We had really strong returns with adjusted ROA, ROCE and ROTCE at 1.52%, 11.88% and 20.33%, respectively. More importantly, we achieved positive operating leverage on a linked- and like-quarter basis, a very strong operating performance. Loans held for investments averaged $146.2 billion, which was up a strong 5.8% annualized. Margin on a net and core basis improved, with net margin improving two basis points, core margin improving three basis points, and Daryl will give you more color on that. Adjusted efficiency ratio was slightly down, and grooved at 57.3%. Adjusted non-interest expense has totalled $1.7 billion, which was up 1.5% versus third quarter 2017. However, if you exclude Regions Insurance, our expenses would have been actually down slightly. So we\u2019re exhibiting excellent expense discipline, even recognizing that we\u2019re making substantial investments in building what I call the new bank or the digital bank. So we are controlling expenses very, very well. Credit quality was excellent, and Clarke will give you some detail on that in the Q&A. We did increase our quarterly dividend 8% to $0.405 per share. We completed our acquisition of Regions Insurance, and that was a giant add from both a cultural and a market perspective point of view. And by the way, the execution on that has gone extraordinarily well, and Chris can give you detail on that on Q&A and we did complete $200 million in share repurchases. If you\u2019re following along the deck, on Page 4, you\u2019ll see that we did have merger-related and restructuring charges of $18 million pre-tax; $13 million after tax and that impacted EPS negatively by $0.02 per share. Looking at Page 5, in terms of loans, I think it was a very good loan quarter. Our average loans held for investment grew 5.8% annualized, as I mentioned a minute ago. C&I was up 2.3%, but a broad base of very strong performance in that space. Premium finance, Corporate Banking, dealer floor plan, mortgage warehouse all had strong performances. Our leasing portfolio was up 16.8%, which is very strong. Overall, retail was a very strong 11.3%, led by residential mortgage in some high-yielding, high-quality mortgage portfolios. Our acquisitions that we are holding, 16.6%. Direct was off a little bit, but that is turning, and we still feel very good in terms of the direction of that. And our indirect performance was outstanding, with strong performances in Regional Acceptance and in Sheffield. So overall, loans are performing very, very well in a good economy but not an easy economy. If you\u2019re following along, we\u2019ll look at deposits on Page 6. Overall, a healthy core deposit growth with noninterest-bearing deposits of 1.6%. While it\u2019s down some from previous quarters, it is very good relative to what\u2019s going on in the industry, and we feel very good about that. So our percentage of noninterest-bearing deposits to total increased again from 34.2% to 34.4%. And importantly, our cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.66%, which is up nine basis points versus being up 11 basis points last quarter, for improvement there. Likewise, on the cost of total deposits, that was 0.43%, up six basis points versus up seven basis points, so better management of expenses with regard to the core deposits, which we are focusing on and feel good about that. So overall, before I push it over to Daryl, I\u2019d say the economy is solid. We don\u2019t think the tax cut has been fully realized in the economy. Confidence is really, really high. Rates are rising slowly, which is good for everyone. It\u2019s good for the bank, of course, it\u2019s good for investors, CD holders, savings holders, et cetera. It\u2019s really good, if you think about it, for borrowers because the implication of rising rates is the economy\u2019s good. And so raising \u2013 rising rates is a good thing for everybody. Regulations are slowly but clearly being reduced to reasonable levels, and that\u2019s a really, really positive thing. And importantly, we are spending a lot of time building what I call the new bank, and we\u2019re doing it by substantial investments but we\u2019re able to hold our expenses relatively flat, even though we\u2019re investing heavily there by pruning expenses out of the old bank so that we can invest aggressively into the new bank, which is good for our clients and good for our shareholders as well. So let me pass it over to Daryl for some more color. Daryl Bible : Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I\u2019m excited to talk about our excellent credit quality, improving margins and record fee income, effective expense control and our guidance for the fourth quarter. Turning to Slide 7. Our asset quality remains excellent. Net charge-offs totaled $127 million, up five basis points but flat compared to last year. This was driven by seasonal increases in the Consumer portfolio. Our NPAs continue to be historically low, with an NPA ratio of 27 basis points. This is the lowest level since second quarter of 2006, and is primarily driven by a decline in nonperforming CRE loans. Continuing on Slide 8, our allowance coverage ratios remain strong at 3.05x for net charge-offs and 2.68x for NPLs. The allowance to loans ratio was 1.05%, flat from last quarter. We reported a provision of $135 million compared to net charge-offs of $127 million, a modest allowance build. We provided $15 million to our allowance for natural disasters, now at $35 million to reflect for potential losses from recent hurricanes. Turning to Slide 9, reported net interest margin was 3.47%, up two basis points. Core margin was 3.37%, up three basis points. Both increases reflect asset sensitivity to higher short-term risks. The cost of interest-bearing deposits was 66 basis points, up nine basis points versus 11 last quarter. Noninterest-bearing deposits are up as we continue to grow retail and business accounts. As a result, total deposit costs increased only six basis points. Since the beginning of the rate cycle, the interest-bearing deposit beta was 22% and the total deposit beta, including noninterest-bearing deposits, was only 12%. The deposit beta for this quarter was 43%, almost flat from last quarter. Interest-bearing liability costs increased 12 basis points. Asset sensitivity declined as fixed rate assets grew more than floating-rate assets, plus funding mix changed more than shorter \u2013 to more shorter re-pricing terms. Continuing on Slide 10, noninterest income was a record $1.2 billion. Our fee income ratio was down slightly to 42.3%. Insurance income was down $33 million, mostly due to seasonality. The Regions Insurance acquisition contributed $33 million in revenue. It is going really well. We are seeing better performance than what we have modeled. Even when you include Regions, insurance income was up 4.5% from last year, reflecting improved organic growth. Mortgage banking income declined $15 million, primarily due to declining gain-on-sale margins. Turning to Slide 11, our expense management continues to be strong. Adjusted noninterest expense came in just over $1.7 billion, up 1.5% from a year ago. Regions Insurance added $31 million to expenses. When you adjust for Regions and merger and restructuring charges, expenses were down $5 million from a year ago and $3 million from last quarter. We added 654 FTEs with the Regions deal. When you exclude that, FTEs were down 203. Excluding merger-related charges, expenses are down for the year, excluding all the investments and the Regions Insurance acquisition. We are doing a good job controlling expenses and that contributed to positive operating leverage versus last quarter and last year. Continuing on Slide 12, our capital and liquidity remain strong. Common equity Tier one was at 10.2%. Our dividend payout ratio was 40% and our total payout ratio was 65%. In addition to acquiring Regions Insurance, we repurchased $200 million worth of common shares. We plan to repurchase $375 million in the fourth quarter. Now let\u2019s look at our segment results, beginning on Slide 13. Community Bank retail and Consumer Finance net income was $391 million. The $14 million improvement was driven by loan growth in mortgage, auto and credit cards. Higher spreads on deposits. This is partially offset by lower mortgage banking income. We continue to close branches where it makes sense. We closed nine branches this quarter, and we plan to close about 70 more next quarter. This strategy isn\u2019t just about controlling expenses. We are reinvesting these funds across the bank in areas such as digital and client experience. Continuing on Slide 14, average loans increased $1.9 billion, mostly due to our strategy to retain high-quality mortgage loans. The increase in prime and near prime loan originations drove up the auto portfolio. Deposit balances decreased $506 million, driven by a decline in interest checking. Noninterest-bearing DDA increased 5.5% from a year ago. Turning to Slide 15, community Banking Commercial net income was $310 million. The $33 million increase was driven by higher spreads on deposits and deposit growth, this was partially offset by higher personnel expense resulting from lower capitalized employee cost. Our commercial pipeline was down from last quarter. Continuing on Slide 16, average loans were flat. Deposits increased $606 million, primarily due to money market and savings accounts. Turning to Slide 17, financial services and consumer finance net income was $149 million. The increase was driven by loan growth, improving deposit spreads and record investment banking and brokerage income. Continuing on Slide 18, average loans were up $164 million, driven by Corporate Banking, equipment finance and wealth. Deposits were up $387 million. Turning to Slide 19, Insurance and Premium Finance net income totaled $43 million. The $30 million decline was driven by seasonality and was partially offset by income from Regions Insurance. Like-quarter organic growth was up 6.7%, mostly due to a 9% increase in new business and improved property and casualty pricing. On Slide 20, you will see our outlook. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect total loans held for investment to be up 1% to 3% annualized, linked quarter. Slower growth guidance is due to the expected seasonal decline in Mortgage Warehouse Lending, Sheffield and premium finance portfolios. We expect net charge-offs to be in the range of 35 to 45 basis points. The loan-loss provision is expected to match net charge-offs plus loan growth. We expect GAAP and core margin to be up slightly, fee income to be up 2% to 4% versus like quarter and expenses are expected to be up 1% to 3% versus like quarter. And finally, we expect an effective tax rate of 21%. While we dropped the full year guidance from the table, there are no changes in that guidance. We continue to grow revenue faster than expenses, resulting in positive operating leverage. In summary, the quality of our earnings this quarter was excellent, resulting in record quarterly earnings, positive operating leverage, strong, broad-based loan growth, very strong credit quality and excellent expense management. Now let me turn it back over to Kelly for closing remarks and Q&A. Kelly King : Thanks, Daryl. So in summary, it\u2019s a lovely, great quarter. As Daryl said, we had record earnings, expenses are being managed in an excellent manner. And we have excellent execution of strategies that are designed to create more diversified and resilient profitability, which I think is very, very important. And at the same time, we\u2019re investing substantially in our digital platform or what I call the new bank, creating outstanding client experiences, which is critical for the future. The economy is good, rates are rising, regulations are improving. That\u2019s a pretty good scenario for banking. There are plenty of challenges out there, but we have huge opportunities to build our new bank while nurturing our old bank. We have huge opportunities to realize organic growth in revenues and fees from strategies that we\u2019ve been working on for a number of years. Finally, I would just like to invite all of you to attend our investor conference day. We\u2019re very excited about it, and hope you will come. We\u2019re going to spend a lot of time talking about current and long-term strategies. Hope you\u2019d get a good feel for the essence of BB&T as we\u2019ll talk a good bit about our culture. We are having the meeting on November 13 and 14 at our Leadership Institute, so I hope you\u2019ll come on over and join us. We look forward to having a good time. So for all of these reasons, we feel adamantly our best days are ahead. I\u2019ll turn it over now to Alan. Alan Greer : Great, thank you, Kelly. Andrea, at this time, if you would come back on the line and explain how our listeners can participate in the question-and-answer session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Mr. John McDonald from Bernstein. Please go ahead sir. John McDonald : Hi, good morning guys. I wanted to ask about the loan growth. You showed good loan growth this quarter, and I\u2019m just wondering if you could break it down a little bit more between the Commercial side and the Consumer side. Specifically, on Commercial, some of your peers have been running to elevated paydowns. And I did notice on a period-end basis, your C&I balances were down. So I\u2019m just wondering what you\u2019re seeing there. And then on the mortgage side, it seemed like resi mortgage was a big driver of loan growth this quarter. What were some of the factors there? Clarke Starnes : John, this is Clarke. I\u2019ll take that. Kelly mentioned earlier, on the C&I or the commercial side, we have pretty broad-based growth drivers, Corporate Banking was a positive. Our dealer floor plan, mortgage warehouse, Premium Finance, our Sheffield C&I component, our small ticket leasing and our general leasing, so I think the takeaway was we got it in a number of different areas. We are not just solely dependent upon traditional middle-market C&I, although we did certainly play hard there as well. To your point about the quarter end, we did have some accelerated paydowns, both on lines and payouts as also the CRE side as we are seeing more clients, as rates are going up, taking stabilized properties, for example, out to the secondary market. We\u2019re also seeing things like tech sponsors coming in, buying middle-market companies, some of those are paying out. So certainly, we have paydown challenges, but we think the diversified set of platforms we have helped us overcome that as we look forward. On the retail side, you\u2019re right we had a nice improvement in the resi side. We chose to hold some high \u2013 very high-quality super conforming and jumbos out of our correspondent area as correspondent margins are really tight; but these are very high-quality, high-yielding assets. We had growth in our indirect platforms as Kelly mentioned. I would mention we also had outstanding results in our card growth. We introduced a new set of products this quarter and we\u2019re getting outstanding reception from our clients. So overall, I think it\u2019s a diversification story for us. John McDonald : Okay. Kelly King : Yes, and John, I just want to stress two of the points that Clarke made, I mean as this was very, very important. So we\u2019ve been working for years on developing this diversified strategy around lending because we just think, in the environment we\u2019re in today, we\u2019ve got a single focus in terms of lending strategy. That\u2019s looks great; that particular category is good but it doesn\u2019t look so good when it\u2019s soft. And so we try to get the best performance we can out of all the categories, but the key is to have a multifaceted loan asset strategy, which we do. And then the other thing about these paydowns, I think people saw the 10-year spike up. I think people are just kind of \u2013 it\u2019s a tipping point, they think rates are going on up. They\u2019re probably right and so they\u2019re taking these portfolios on out to the market where they\u2019re qualified. It\u2019s a fairly temporary phenomenon. Next one or two quarters, you\u2019ll that subside. And with good, solid production \u2013 companies that have good, solid production will see substantial increase in loan growth. John McDonald : Okay, great. And then just wanted to ask, Daryl and Kelly, you\u2019ve got a nice, it seems like, acceleration in operating leverage this year. First quarter, it\u2019s about 100 basis points. The last two quarters, you\u2019ve been more like 200 basis points year-over-year operating leverage. Is that the right level that you think you can hold or maybe even expand those jaws, widen those further in 2019? Just want to get your thoughts on that. Kelly King : I\u2019ll give you some thoughts and Daryl can get into more detail. But we think that we can continue positive operating leverage because of two things. One I just alluded to, we have a multifaceted approach on revenues. I mean, it\u2019s not just our loan strategies if you look at our Insurance business, our wealth strategy, different number of strategies are producing fees that are very strong and getting better by the day. And we are focusing intense energy on controlling our expenses. Now we are investing heavily in digital, et cetera, et cetera, which a lot of people are doing, but we\u2019re not allowing that to drive our expenses up. We\u2019re simply holding ourselves accountable. We\u2019re saying, yes, we have to make those expense investments, but we have to prune the cost in the old bank, like closing branches and finding new, better \u2013 new and better ways to do things. And we\u2019ve got a lot going on with regard to expense management in this company on a multifaceted set of fronts. So I am personally very confident in terms of positive operating leverage. Any color, Daryl? Daryl Bible : Yes. I think, John, as Kelly said, we have a lot more financial flexibility on the expense side as we kind of make the changes on the traditional bank. I think we\u2019re reallocating expenses, and feel pretty good expenses are flat pretty much year-over-year. When you look at it, we ended \u2013 we\u2019re forecasting to be at $6.8 billion in expenses adjusted this year, which is flat from 2017. We hope to try to continue that into 2019. On the revenue side, we don\u2019t have the run-off portfolios that we had in the prior year. Mortgage is growing. Auto is growing. We\u2019re getting real close to turning the direct retail fees in the next couple of quarters. So we feel good that loan growth will be an engine for revenue growth. Our margins are growing slightly, as rates continue to go up, so it\u2019s positive pressure on revenue there. I think fee income, our core fee income businesses should continue to grow quite nicely. I know mortgage is under stress but this next quarter, commercial mortgage should be really strong. If you look at Insurance, Chris can comment on that, but that\u2019s growing nicely organically. Service charges are up. We\u2019re having a higher record account growth going on right now. And then investment banking and brokerage had record revenue. So I think we\u2019re starting to hit on most of our cylinders right now, and I think we\u2019re very \u2013 feel optimistic about revenue. John McDonald : Thanks guys. Operator : We will now take our next question from Ms. Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead ma\u2019am. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Daryl Bible : Hey Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Okay, so a couple of questions. One, just wanted to dig in a little bit on the loan growth here on the outlook because you had, obviously, very strong loan growth LQA this quarter but I noticed you have a 1% to 3% LQA expectation for next quarter. Could you just give us a sense as to why you\u2019re anticipating that kind of deceleration or is that just conservatism on your part? Maybe you can give us some color on that. Kelly King : So Betsy, generally, its two things. We do have, as you well know, the seasonal slowdown in the fourth. And we are, I think, being a little conservative, but we are expecting these paydowns to continue. And that\u2019s built into our forecast. Now if the paydowns were to subside earlier than we expect, that could give us a positive lift. But it\u2019s basically seasonality and exaggerated paydowns. Daryl Bible : Yes, if you back out the seasonal portfolios, Betsy, that we talked about, our 5.8% this quarter was aided by seasonality. So 5.8% becomes to like maybe mid-4s, 4.5%, I would think. And if you back that in and factor that in into the fourth quarter, our 1% to 3% would really be closer to 2% to 4% if we didn\u2019t have the rundown in those portfolios. So we\u2019re really only slowing down loan growth a little bit, not as much as what you\u2019re seeing there, just because of seasonality. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then secondly, separate topic, just on the outlook for reserving, fantastic credit quality this quarter and the AOLR ratio is holding steady. The question I have is how you\u2019re thinking about that AOLR ratio and maybe you can give us some color around how you\u2019re also thinking about CECL. There\u2019s been some news recently about some industry developments. Maybe you can give us some thoughts on that as well. Clarke Starnes : Yes, Betsy. This is Clarke, I\u2019ll take a stab at where we are today, and then Daryl will chip in on CECL. So we\u2019re at 1.05%, and obviously we\u2019ve got very good coverage ratios right now, but I think our long-term perspective is we\u2019re in the long cycle. It\u2019s been very good. We\u2019re all leaning into a lot of new areas in the abnormal seasoning. So to us, now is not the time to be releasing reserves. But given the excellent credit quality, I mean, the outlook\u2019s still very positive, we think we should have stable to very solid performance. So I think, in our view, it looks more like a stable reserve rate versus any big build. Definitely no releases. Daryl Bible : Yes, I think from a modeling perspective, we\u2019re working along the lines of being ready to go parallel sometime in early part of 2019. We have modified our CCAR models and are using most of them for CECL. And what we\u2019re finding is that the models are very pro cyclical, which is a concern that we have on the impact on the economy. I don\u2019t know if you saw it, but yesterday, the Bank Policy Institute sent out a letter, Greg Baer, representing the top 50 banks in the U.S., asking for FSOC, which is basically chaired by Secretary Mnuchin and all the regulators, to ask FASB for a pause to study the impact on the economy because of a procyclicality. And the studies that we\u2019ve seen and the analysis that we have basically shows that our ability to lend if we went through the last downturn that we just went through, would be twice as worse as what we had just because of the distortion of earnings and capital because of how the accounting is being accounted for with CECL. So we feel that we\u2019ll prepare to go forward with it. But FASB could change the accounting such that it more reflects the reality of lending, that would be a positive and then the regulators could also impact and maybe have capital relief. But both of those is something that we\u2019re hopeful for; the industry seems to be pretty united in that right now, from small banks all the way up to the largest banks, and we\u2019re hopeful that the regulators in FASB listen and do what\u2019s right for the economy and our clients. Kelly King : And I just want to stress this for the entire audience listening, this is a really big deal. I mean, the banks will be able to survive it but the problem is, if it goes into effect as now projected, it\u2019s really bad for the economy. It\u2019s really bad for consumers. It\u2019s really bad for business. It is not the right thing to do. And so we are asking FASB to slow down, take a breath, let\u2019s study this carefully and let\u2019s see what the real impacts are and likely, let\u2019s make some adjustments. So we have Secretary Mnuchin, and we believe he will lead the effort through the Financial Stability Oversight Council to bring all the organizations together to look at how negative this will be from a systemic point of view. So a lot of good momentum. Anybody out there listening that has a chance to talk to congressional people and/or regulators, please put in your word for it because now is our time to get this changed and put it into a more proper light. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And in the meantime, you are moving ahead with the parallel run next year, is that right? Daryl Bible : Yes. Since we have Investor Day next month, Betsy, I\u2019ll give you some projections. It won\u2019t be finalized yet, but I\u2019ll give you some projections on the impact. But since our portfolio is diversified 50% retail, 50% commercial, the consumer portfolios tend to get hit pretty hard in CECL especially under stress times. Our allowance would probably be higher than what it is now, but we\u2019re really concerned with the volatility. But we\u2019ll be able to show you all that. We\u2019ll show you the pro cyclicality that we have and anything else, but it won\u2019t really get finalized until probably middle of next year when we have more exact changes on the allowance. But it\u2019s really also dependent on the economy, what\u2019s going on in the economy. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will now take our next question from Ms. Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Please go ahead ma\u2019amortization. Erika Najarian : Hi. Good morning. Daryl Bible : Good morning. Erika Najarian : So I just wanted to, first, thank you for reminding us of the diversity of your Commercial portfolio. There\u2019s been a lot of talk about the emergence of nonbanks in traditional middle-market lending. And I\u2019m wondering if you could give us a sense and a flavor of what those competitive dynamics are like, particularly on structure. And whether the competitive dynamics in businesses like premium finance or Sheffield are different and perhaps more defensible. And really what I\u2019m trying to get at is that if the economy continues to be good next year and nonbanks continue to be a factor in Corporate Banking, is BB&T\u2019s loan growth perhaps more defensible, given those competitive dynamics? Kelly King : Yes, that is a really good, insightful question, and that\u2019s the point, Erika, we\u2019ve been trying to make. It is true that the nonbanks are still very, very aggressive and they are clearly penetrating further down into the commercial portfolio than they ever have. My own view is they\u2019re taking enormous risk. And when we do have a cycle, you\u2019re going to see a lot of them washed out and that will be a very good thing. But today, they are a competitive factor. They are driving structure down, they\u2019re driving rates down and it\u2019s making it substantially tougher for commercial banks to be able to compete in the market. And that\u2019s not to say we don\u2019t try really hard, it\u2019s not to say we\u2019re out of the business, but they\u2019ll take our credit and they\u2019ll take it to an extreme of low-risk returns that we just aren\u2019t going to go into. So to your point, that\u2019s why BB&T has been so focused over the last 10 years on developing these diversified strategies, and they are more defensible. The nonbanks don\u2019t get into areas like Sheffield and premium finance and areas like that, that we have. So I\u2019m not saying we don\u2019t have competition there, but it\u2019s not the kind of competition you\u2019re seeing from these nonbanks. And so if you put that whole portfolio and our whole portfolio together compared to some others, I would say that we\u2019re in a relatively much stronger position moving forward in terms of growth relative to competition \u2013 aggregate competition. So then our growth would be relatively more impacted by the general economy versus any specific competitor. Erika Najarian : Got it. And my follow-up question is, just wanted to clarify your response to John\u2019s question on operating leverage. As we think about 2019, should we think about revenues and expenses relative to each other? Or is it possible that the $6.8 billion level of expenses can be maintained, even if revenues are perhaps a little bit better than what consensus expects? Kelly King : So Erika, we\u2019ve been saying for the last, really, couple of years, that we are intensely focused on being disciplined with regard to expense [indiscernible]. You can\u2019t just say that. You have to do it a lot because your expenses are naturally going up, absent any intervention. And so we\u2019ve been working really, really hard for well over a year on multifaceted strategies. And it\u2019s not just little strategies. We have big strategies. We have large projects going on across the company. And it\u2019s all about reconceptualization and building the new bank and being sure we have the foundation laid so that we are very successful for the next 146 years. And so we take all that very, very seriously. We call it building the new bank. And so that\u2019s allowing us to hold expenses relatively flattish. As we said, over a year ago, we delivered; we think that\u2019ll carry into 2019. And certainly we expect revenue to increase. We expect to have decent loan growth as margins are improving, rates are going up. But in addition to that, we have so many fee businesses that have such great opportunity. Our Insurance business is \u2013 and Chris is doing a great job, with John Howard, our President. But it is really coming into its own and has huge opportunities in terms of improvement on our wealth strategy, our credit card businesses. Across the board, we have multifaceted strategies that are driving up not just interest income but fee income. So for all these reasons, we feel very confident about positive operating leverage. Erika Najarian : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Operator : We will now take our next question from Mr. Stephen Scouten from Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead, sir. Stephen Scouten : Hi, good morning. I was curious if you could speak to the move in end-of-period deposits. I know you have the slides talking about average deposits. But it looks like end of period, we\u2019re down about $5 billion quarter-over-quarter. I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s any expected reversal in 4Q? Or if you think you might face higher loan-to-deposit ratios as we move into 2019? Daryl Bible : Yes, Steve, this is Daryl. I would tell you our liquidity and core funding is really strong. One of the categories that we use to fund the bank is Eurodollar time deposits. That\u2019s not a client funding source, it\u2019s a national market funding source but it goes into our deposit totals. We were pretty much out of that at the end of the quarter. This past quarter, that was probably worth $2 billion or $3 billion. We also have some seasonality on when just how deposits move back and forth. So what I really look at is average deposits over like periods of the previous year because that\u2019s really \u2013 you can see in the comp the seasonality that ebb, and I think our core deposits are growing nicely. Our noninterest-bearing deposits grew a little over 1%, which is really strong in this rate environment right now. So we feel very good from a deposit perspective. But you did see a little attrition out of some public deposits. During the quarter, three clients did move out. But that was very much rate driven; those tend to be hotly competed funding sources in some situations. But our core deposit growth is strong. Our account growth, when you look at account growth, we haven\u2019t had account growth \u2013 you think that as we are down over 300 branches and our account growth that we\u2019re getting right now is the highest it\u2019s been in 10 years in our system, it\u2019s coming through the branches that we have out there, through our direct channels, our digital channels, our niche businesses that we have that focus on deposits. So all that is really strong, and I would say organic growth on deposits is the best it\u2019s been in a long, long time. Kelly King : And all of that is driven by the fact that we are having substantial improvement in client satisfaction from our clients. All of the things we\u2019re doing in terms of digital banking, our virtual call centers are really paying off. And so satisfaction\u2019s up which, as Daryl said, is driving net account growth, which is really good. Stephen Scouten : Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. And then I guess as I think about that heading into 2019, if you\u2019re getting away from these Euro deposits and maybe you fund some of the gap with, it looks like, short-term borrowings at least in the near term, what does that do to your NIM outlook as we move into 2019? Do you think if we get to, say, a 94%, 95% loan-to-deposit ratio, we could see less upside with further rate hikes that we may see? Or how can I think about that funding gap and the impact on costs moving into 2019? Daryl Bible : Yes, Steve, I really don\u2019t think we have a funding gap. I think our core deposits will grow in sync with our loan growth. We will augment that growth through nonclient funding. Now that comes and goes just because of seasonality in deposits. So we could add Eurodollars back into this quarter. It\u2019s really a funding decision, cost decision. But over the long term, I think we are very focused on making sure core deposits grow with loans, and we think we can accomplish that. From a margin outlook, we are still asset sensitive. As rates rise, we think our core is still going to go up a couple basis points. Our purchase accounting is pretty much out of our system, and there\u2019s only 10 basis points left. So we\u2019re only really losing maybe one basis point a quarter now as that fades away. So I think margining should be up slightly on a reported basis as well, as rates continue to rise. Stephen Scouten : Okay, great. Thanks for the color on the branch closings versus the account growth. That\u2019s good to know, I appreciate that. Operator : We will now take our next question from Mr. Michael Rose from Raymond James. Please go ahead, sir. Michael Rose : Hey, good morning guys. Just wanted to get a little color on the share repurchases. I know you purchased \u2013 repurchased $200 million this quarter. I think Daryl said $375 million. Your authorization is $1.7 billion. Any reason for the lag as we think about the next couple of quarters? Daryl Bible : We\u2019re really just trying to manage our capital ratio. As we said all along, we want to keep our ratios pretty consistent and not really lever up the company any more right now. So if you look at our slides that we have there, our CET1 is at 10.2% for the last five quarters, and we\u2019re really just keep \u2013 trying to keep it in that range. And based upon what we think the balance sheet growth is going to do, it\u2019ll come up at that same number. Whether we spend the whole $1.7 billion really depends on how much the balance sheet grows. That\u2019s why we\u2019re giving you the amount that we\u2019re buying back quarter-to-quarter. Michael Rose : Very helpful. And then maybe a follow-up. And I know there\u2019s been a lot of talk around you guys\u2019 M&A strategy, the slides have come out of the deck. I just want to see where you guys stand with the Consent Order and any thoughts on M&A going forward. Thanks. Kelly King : With the Consent Order, we\u2019re moving along, as we reported before, we\u2019ve effectively done all that is required of us in terms of our BSA/AML program. We are finishing up the final leg of an automation project that will be completed by the end of the year. So we \u2013 as you know, we already had the Consent Order both with the FDIC and the state. We fully expect as we head into the first quarter, if not before, that the Fed will conform with FDIC and the state. So there\u2019s no issue there, it\u2019s just a matter of timing and expectations of regulators in terms of when we actually dot every I and cross every T with regard to the automation of certain aspects of our BSA/AML program. So that\u2019s all going very, very well. As I said, we are laser focused on organic growth. We are very excited about all of the things that we have going on. We can grow this company in terms of revenues. We can control expenses, we can increase earnings and EPS, which we think will result in improved TSRs for our shareholders and that\u2019s what we\u2019re laser focused on. Michael Rose : All right. Thanks for taking my question. Operator : We will now take our next question from Mr. Matt O\u2019Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O\u2019Connor: I was hoping to follow up on kind of the last track of questioning there. And I guess my question would be, your capital levels are very strong. Some of your peers, like USB has an 8.5% target; SunTrust, 8% to 9%. I\u2019m not sure they\u2019re getting down though right away. But why can\u2019t you bring your capital down as you think about the medium term to those levels? And obviously, you\u2019ve just addressed the fact that you\u2019re more focused on organic growth and less on deals. So are you hopeful that loan growth accelerates that much? Do you just want some cushion in case of a downturn? Or what\u2019s the thought process on keeping capital so high, especially considering how well you performed in the CCAR process? Kelly King : So that is an opportunity, if you think about our company. We are conservative, you\u2019ve got to start with that, but we\u2019re not irrational either. So there are multifaceted reasons why at this very moment we are being conservative. One is we want to get a better read in terms of future projected economy. We feel good about it, but there\u2019s a lot going on in the world and so we\u2019re holding a little bit of powder dry [ph] because of that. Banks, they want to see how the CECL thing plays out because nobody can tell you today what the underlying impact on capital can be. And we just don\u2019t want to ever be in a place where we end up having to pull out our products out from the marketplace. It\u2019ll cost you a little bit [indiscernible] capital, but cost you a lot if you have to raise capital potentially at such an opportune time. And so for those two reasons, we\u2019re holding a little extra capital today. I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re holding a huge amount of extra capital because of M&A. We \u2013 if we were to do any kind of deals, that the companies would be well capitalized or we wouldn\u2019t be interested in them anyway. So I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a big issue. So \u2013 and to be honest, there\u2019s been a lot of movement recently with regard to discussions in Washington around the $250 billion level. Independent of M&A, we will get to $250 billion at some point between margin and growth. And so \u2013 but there\u2019s a lot of movement right now. You\u2019ve heard from some of the speeches that Vice Chairman Quarles has talked about looking \u2013 aggressively looking at above $250 billion. So it\u2019s not self-evident that we would even have to have additional capital above $250 billion. So when you see some clarity around all of those factors, there\u2019s clearly the opportunity for us to lower our capital relationships. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then just separately, the Regions Insurance acquisition, it was roughly breakeven, slightly accretive to earnings this quarter. But obviously, the cost saves are still to come. Can you remind us what the margin opportunity is there as we think about that business? Chris Henson : Yes, Matt, it\u2019s Chris. So we actually expect the full year \u2013 we had a two-year model. We expect the full year actually to be about three times better than what we expected. So you should see some improvement from here. And we expect the margin \u2013 as we are able to kind of harvest this $25 million to $30 million in synergies, we expect the margin to bump up about 15% really in the first year. It could even be a little faster depending on timing. And so the margin of that group should be actually accretive to our overall insurance margin. So we expect it to be very helpful to go through. We had great integration, retention. I think we\u2019ve lost one producer, and so we\u2019ve had real strong retention across the whole company. Systems conversion is coming up November 2, and we expect that to kind of go very, very smoothly. So we think it\u2019s very helpful, as we get the synergies, to drive the margin. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will now take our next question from Mr. Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Gerard Cassidy : Maybe Clarke can address this on credit quality. Obviously, as you pointed out, Daryl, in your opening remarks, credit quality is extremely strong today for BB&T and for the industry. A couple of questions. One is what indicators are you guys monitoring to look for any cracks that may start to develop in credit quality? Again, I know it\u2019s coming off of a very low base. And then second, I was struck by your comment that this is the best credit quality since 2006, and we all know what happened following 2006 to the industry\u2019s credit quality. So I\u2019m trying to get my arms around that credit is great and what could cause the next issue for the industry as we look out over the next two years? Clarke Starnes : Gerard, this is Clarke. That\u2019s a very good question. I\u2019ll take a stab at it. A couple of things, I just would remind you all that I think all banks are operating at very low levels of losses and nonperforming assets probably below long-term trend levels, even with stable risk taking. So I think part of that is we\u2019ve just been in a very good economy, long end of the credit cycle. So at some point, it will normalize to more historical level. It\u2019s just a matter of when \u2013 we\u2019re trying to be very mindful of that. So we think, obviously, any shock there or any change in the economy would certainly have an effect. But some of the things we\u2019re looking at, just trying to be very careful about watching early seasoning in our portfolios, any characteristics of risk increasing or borrower deterioration I think is really important. You can\u2019t just look at current performance metrics. To your point, you have to look at forward-looking risk management. You\u2019ve got to do stress testing. And I think the bigger risk for the industry right now, a lot of people are pushing into new, unseasoned areas of risk taking. A lot of that coming out of open banking disruptors, things like digital unsecured lenders through third parties, lots of people going into areas they haven\u2019t been in before. So I think if you\u2019re going to see a crack in the future, in my opinion, it would be not fully appreciating the fact that a lot of these portfolios are unseasoned now and may be taking more risk than people realize. The other thing I would say is we\u2019re clearly seeing higher risk taking in traditional areas like C&I by the smaller banks. I think some of the smaller institutions are clearly taking more risk than what you see the large regionals or mid banks take. Kelly King : So Gerard, here\u2019s another interesting thing to think about. I think all of us tend to think in terms of patterns, and I think the challenge maybe we all have today is we\u2019re trying to resort back to traditional 30, 40-year patterns, which might not be rational. This 10-year process we\u2019ve been through is very unusual. So as you know, typically, we have recessions that are relatively deep. We have steep improvements, booms, and then we have another raise from the asset buys [ph]. We don\u2019t have that this time. This has been a very slow, methodical recovery, which may lead, a, to a longer recovery than most people expect; and b, it may not lead to a steep negative credit correction. And I\u2019m with Clarke, it kind of feels like we\u2019re based on the bottom but that\u2019s based on my pattern of thinking. And so I just \u2013 I\u2019m trying to challenge my own self in terms of just thinking in terms of patterns. This is a new world, a new environment and there is a reasonable chance that we will see a relatively continued slow, steady type of market for a number of years, which may not end up in a substantial credit cycle, which I know everybody is expecting. Gerard Cassidy : Very helpful, Kelly. Speaking of patterns, turning the clock back even further, when you compare what we just went through in 2007, 2008, to the 1990 banking debacle, that debacle, as we all recall, was pretty severe and we had a great recovery coming out of 1990. But as we got into the end of the decade, which led to some incredible consolidation amongst our biggest banks, I don\u2019t think anybody would have dreamed of Chemical, Chase, Manny Hanny and JPMorgan becoming one bank at some point in the future which, of course, happened. Kelly, in your view, when you look out two to three years, do you see big bank consolidation, where $100 billion and a $200 billion or $150 billion and a $50 billion bank get together? And if so, what has to happen to kind of get that catalyst going? Kelly King : I remember, George, that the 1990 debacle, as you called it was \u2013 and I lived right in the middle of it, it was a commercial real estate-driven kind of phenomenon. We had a huge run-up in commercial real estate. We had some profit lending, and most of the larger banks back then were much more commercially driven than they are today. Most of them are diversified; maybe not as much as us, but most are diversified. So we\u2019re not as totally commercially dependent. So number one, I don\u2019t think we have the tendency to build up commercial risk that we had back then. So I think it may be not quite as good a comparison. But to the extent that there will be cycles and to the extent that there will be corrections in credit portfolios, et cetera, obviously that will put pressure on earnings. That will cause organizations to have to contemplate their strategic futures. But to be honest, I don\u2019t really expect to see a lot of big M&A, big bank mergers. I really don\u2019t. At one time I did, as you know, but I don\u2019t expect to see that today. I think what\u2019s happening \u2013 and this is a relatively recent phenomenon, and it\u2019s beginning to cause me to at least think again, out of pattern, a little differently about scale and size. Historically, I thought in terms of \u2013 and you had to get your scale to get your cost per unit down because you had to build all these systems and all yourself. We\u2019re now looking at some systems improvements where we\u2019re not going to have to build it ourselves. We\u2019re looking at \u2013 so there\u2019s a real movement inside our industry and outside providers to use a shared utility concept where it\u2019s possible for organizations to plug into a shared utility and not have to have inherently the scale necessary to get the cost per unit down. In fact, our banking industry through the Bank Policy Institute and The Clearing House, are working on some shared utility concepts today, where all the banks will own certain activities and will all have the maximum scale advantage. So there\u2019s some interesting movements now that I\u2019m really happy about that will potentially tap down the need for high scale in terms of getting real good operating decisions. Gerard Cassidy : Appreciate it. Thank you, Kelly. Operator : We will now take our next question from Mr. Saul Martinez from UBS. Please go ahead. Saul Martinez : Kelly, I wanted to follow-up on your comments about the regulatory environment. Then and you \u2013 I think you mentioned that there\u2019s not a lot of movement related to above $250 billion banks, which makes sense, given the Fed\u2019s focus on S.2155 in banks of $100 billion to $250 billion. But Vice Chair Quarles has been very clear that he thinks prudential regulation should move to a model based on complexity as opposed to size. So, I\u2019m curious how optimistic you are that we do eventually move towards that model and whether \u2013 and to what extent banks above $250 billion, which you will, obviously, cross at some point, will benefit and how that could play out over the next couple of years. Kelly King : So, I think Vice Chair Quarles has a really good handle on this issue. I\u2019ve talked to him directly and heard him in meetings. He really understands this, and he gets that there are a number of institutions, including BB&T \u2013 I\u2019m not speaking for him, that\u2019s my opinion \u2013 but institutions like BB&T that are above $250 billion that do not have the same kind of risk as some of the larger, more globally systemically important institutions. He gets that. And so I\u2019m very optimistic that he is going to be moving towards modifying the prudential regulatory standards above $250 billion. It\u2019s just a meaningless number and \u2013 the Fed actually has a risk scoring card they\u2019ve been using for eight or 10 years that looks at institutions across a broad base, kind of a matrix look at the risk of the institution versus the number in terms of assets and that\u2019s \u2013 and they\u2019ve been using that internally for years. And so I know that he is mindful of that. But for example, if you look at that, BB&T, the scores range from like 0 up to like 450 or 500. BB&T has a score on that thing of about 50 and some of the largest institutions have 450 or 475. So the order of magnitude is really important here. And I think Vice Chair Quarles gets that. So I\u2019m very optimistic that when we do \u2013 whether this is three or four years or whenever it is when we organically most likely move above $250 billion, then I think we very well may not see a material issue in terms of regulatory changes in terms of how they regulate us. Saul Martinez : Okay. No \u2013 that\u2019s helpful. Maybe if I can switch gears a little bit. And maybe this one\u2019s for Chris. But on the insurance business, you guys have expressed optimism and pleasure about how the Regions deal is going. But can you just give us a little bit more color there on the revenue environment and what your expectations are? I think if I exclude Regions, the growth year-on-year is around 4.5%. But I\u2019m just curious, just kind of how we should think about the glide path going forward and if you can just comment on volume trends, pricing trends in that business, that would be helpful. Chris Henson : Sure. I\u2019d be happy to. Actually, our core organic growth, if you exclude contingent, commissions and Regions, is actually for the quarter 6.7%. And it\u2019s 5% for year-to-date. And you\u2019re right, there are about three drivers. One is pricing. Pricing, from everything I\u2019ve read recently, seems to be settling in, in the sort of composite rate of about 2.5%. I mean, we\u2019ve got certain things like commercial auto that\u2019s as high as 6% and transportation, but the composite is at about 2.5%. So you\u2019ve got a healthy pricing environment, and that\u2019s really on the heels of last year\u2019s $100 billion in losses that those three or four storms and wildfires, et cetera, created. Our client retention is also a driver. It\u2019s best-in-class, generally north of 92%, and that\u2019s been consistent for years. Also very strong and industry leading in our wholesale business. And then the one Daryl commented on that I\u2019m most excited about is really the new business production, and that\u2019s really just the economy, having a solid economy driving new exposure units. So if the business adds an extension on their building or they hire new employees, they need new coverage and they need new employee benefits. So as the economy improves, the exposure units grow. For example, this quarter, it was up 9%. Year-to-date, it\u2019s up 12%. It\u2019s been a long time since we\u2019ve had 12% kind of numbers there. So it\u2019s driving overall core organic growth of 5%, and we would \u2013 I think I said last quarter, we were looking at something like 3.5% to 4% organic growth for the year. We\u2019re really looking more like 4% and \u2013 4.5% to 5% now. We feel very, very positive for all the reasons that I\u2019ve mentioned. In addition to that, we\u2019ve got a number of things going, I mentioned the $25 million to $30 million synergies in Regions, that\u2019s a big deal. We\u2019ve got a lot of backroom activities going on, Kelly alluded to it earlier. Backroom systems where we\u2019re applying robotics, and we\u2019ve done a number of other things that we\u2019re actually taking cost out of the business, reconceptualizing our employee benefits business, which is also a big driver. If you think about pricing going forward, yes \u2013 this industry is unlike the way it used to be. It now receives fresh capital pretty consistently through the capital markets in the way of cash bonds and that kind of thing. So it serves to provide a less erratic and more stable kind of market. But I think we\u2019re in a, instead of a down 2% to 3% pricing scenario last year, we\u2019re in kind of that 2%, 2.5% range. And for us, property and small and large accounts are up about 1%, say, the total up 3%, and we\u2019re disproportionately slanted towards property and small and medium-sized accounts. So I think we benefit a bit there as well. Saul Martinez : That\u2019s great. That\u2019s good color. Thanks so much. Operator : We will now take our last question from Mr. John Pancari from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead sir. John Pancari : Good morning. Kelly King : Good morning. Daryl Bible : Good morning. John Pancari : Kelly, just back to your M&A commentary. Just \u2013 I know you\u2019re emphasizing now a little bit less interest in a whole bank M&A. What changed from only a few months ago? I know you put the slide deck out talking about your parameters around deals but your tone has definitely changed now. Is it that scale issue that you mentioned that changed your view on how you look at scale? Is that the main thing that happened over the past few months or is there something else coming into play? Kelly King : So John, there are two things. One is the scale issues that I\u2019ve talked about have definitely changed my views with regard to this whole issue. And the other thing is that, truth be told, most of my comments were taken out of context. Nothing has changed with regard to my view. I\u2019ve been laser focused on revenue growth, and I talked about it extensively for a long time now. And so if you\u2019re referring to some reaction to the last quarter, it was taken out of context. I did not intend to convey that we were actively pursuing. In fact, I think I said I hadn\u2019t made any phone calls with regard to mergers in several years, which is true. So we are laser focused on organic growth, and that\u2019s my message, and I hope it\u2019s understood. John Pancari : Got it. All right. Thank you for clarifying, Kelly. And then separately on \u2013 I just have a question on 2019 expectations. If you can just give a little bit of color. It\u2019s in two areas but real quick on the loan growth side. I know your guidance is 1% to 3% for the quarter \u2013 for fourth quarter. But for 2019, how should we think about loan growth? I know you said 4% to 6% previously. And then separately on the expense side, I know you\u2019re looking at 57% or better on the efficiency ratio for 2019. Is that still something you\u2019re comfortable with? Thanks. Kelly King : So John, we hope you\u2019ll come down to Greensboro for our Investor Conference in a few weeks. We\u2019re going to give you some good color in \u2013 on a number of areas, including the ones you asked about, at our Investor Day conference. So we hope that you will be eager enough to have that question answered to come on down and visit. John Pancari : Do you dangle the carrot? Kelly King : Yes, exactly. John Pancari : All right, all right. Fine. Thank you. Kelly King : Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Currently all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Richard Baytosh of Investor Relations for BB&T Corporation. Please go ahead, sir. Richard Baytosh : Thank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. Thanks to all of our listeners for joining us today. On today's call, we have Kelly King, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Daryl Bible, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review results for the fourth quarter and provide some thoughts for 2019. We also have Chris Henson, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Clarke Starnes, our Chief Risk Officer to participate in the Q&A session. We will be referencing a slide presentation during the call. A copy of the presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the BB&T website. Let me remind you BB&T does not provide public earnings predictions or forecasts.

Please refer to Page 2 in the appendix of our presentation for the appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. And now I will turn it over to Kelly. Kelly King : Thank you very much. Good morning, everybody, and thank you very much for joining our call. So we had a strong fourth quarter, and what I would call, a great year. The quarter had record revenues, very good expense control, improved loan growth, excellent asset quality and strong returns, and the year had a record $3.1 billion in earnings. GAAP net income was $754 million, up 22.8% versus the fourth quarter '17. If you ex merger and restructuring charges, we had a record $813 million in income. Diluted EPS was $0.97, up 26%, but we made a lot of progress, which I'll refer to later, in our Disrupt to Thrive reconceptualization initiative, so we had a substantial restructuring charge this quarter. And so our adjusted diluted EPS was a record $1.05, up 25%. And our adjusted returns were very, very strong. ROA at 1.53%, return on common equity 11.99%, and a very strong return on tangible common at 20.41%. Taxable equivalent revenue was a record $3 billion, up 1.5% annualized versus the third, and that was really driven by good loan growth, NIM expansion, strong performance in insurance and investment banking. Loans held for investment averaged $147.5 billion was up a very strong relative to the environment, a very strong 3.6% annualized. Net interest margin increased 2 basis points, core net interest margin increased 3 basis points, both of which were better than we had expected. Our adjusted efficiency ratio improved to 56.5% versus 57.3%, almost a whole point, creating very strong positive adjusted operating leverage. Adjusted noninterest expense totaled $1.7 billion, up slightly 0.6%, but I would point you that for the whole year was down slightly, which is what we had indicated at the beginning of the year. So we feel very good our expense control. We had outstanding asset quality yet, again. Nonperforming ratio was 0.26%, a decrease of 1 basis point. Net charge-offs were 38 basis points versus 35 basis points in the third quarter and 36 basis points in the fourth quarter '17, both very low and very stable. Strategic initiatives for the quarter. As I said, we made substantial progress in our Disrupt to Thrive initiative. We have been talking about this for almost 2 years now. We started out talking about reconceptualization in all of our businesses. We moved that in terms of wordings for our people's benefit to disrupt or die to simply get everybody's attention that this is a market where you simply have to make major tough decisions to pay away expenses from the old bank to build the new bank of the future. That is in high gear now. We moved the term Disrupt to Thrive to point of the future and that is resonating very, very well with our people, and we're getting substantial cost reductions out of this. We are investing a substantial amount of that in our digital platform and other forms of technological investments that allow us innovate for the future, which is critical to our success. We had a very successful Investor Day. I hope you all were there. If not, I hope you'll come to our next one we have at our BB&T Leadership Center, that was a good night and day for all attending. And we did complete $375 million in share repurchases. As I indicated, we did have some significant merger and restructuring charges, and this was all around mostly our Disrupt to Thrive initiative. Our pretax was $76 million; after tax, $59 million or $0.08 per share. If you follow along in the slide deck this -- well, I'm on Page 5, looking at loans. We had, what I would consider, strong loan growth, overall 3.6%, really good C&I, which is annualized at 4.3%. That was led by good performance in corporate banking, dealer floor plan, equipment finance, automobile lending and recreational lending. Our C&I loan growth was actually negatively impacted by a seasonal decline in mortgage warehouse lending and premium finance always have a seasonal slowdown during this quarter. Indirect loan growth was also impacted by a seasonal slowdown in Sheffield. So still really, really good C&I performance. Our retail portfolios increased due to strong mortgage and indirect growth. We kind of like what's going on in mortgage. Recall that we were optimizing our mortgage portfolio for really about 3 years, where we were reducing the kind of mortgages that we had been holding that were not as good of a risk reward relationship. We've now restructured that focus, and we're getting better yields and lower risk, so we like what we're booking in the mortgage area. Dealer finance and regional grew 6.6% annualized. Recreational grew strong 11.8%. So very, very good performance across the retail portfolio. We also had good momentum in the loan book. During the quarter, our end of period loans were up 6.3% annualized and C&I was up a very strong 14.7%. So really good loan performance across the board. On Page 6, just some information about deposits. I would say deposits was a challenging quarter. We did have total deposit increase of 1.4%. We did see noninterest-bearing deposits decline on a quarterly -- annualized basis of 3.2%, but our total DDA and liquid accounts were only down 2.4%. But what is really happening is companies are putting money to work. And from a economic point of view, we view that as very good news. We did support our loan growth with additional focus on time deposits, and we have plenty of room to grow those -- for those deposits. Our average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $442 million versus the third quarter and again that was primarily in the business area. The percentage of noninterest-bearing deposits was 34% compared to 34.4%, so not a very big change there. Cost of interest-bearing deposits was 78 basis points, up 12 basis points, but total deposits was 0.52%, up 9 basis points. So before turning to Daryl, I would say overall, the -- what we see the real economy is still solid, optimism is still high. There's certainly a lot of chatter about the government shutdown, Brexit, trade talk, all of that, if continued at a high rate over time, could impact the real economy. But so far, on Main Street, we don't see that. You can tell from our loan performance that we had a very strong quarter. And feedback from our people suggest that there is a highlight I heard that, that will continue, again, unless there is just so much rhetoric coming out of D.C. and other places that causes everybody to be depressed. We don't think that will be the case. We think the trade talk is going to be winding down over the next 2 or 3 months, the government shutdown will be figured out. And Brexit, it's hard to figure, but we don't think, at least for us, that has a material impact on our business. So I'll remind you, again, Main Street was a drive for BB&T for about 10 years. As the global companies are doing better, all of these factors tend to affect the global companies more than they affect Main Street. And so that is really a relatively strong positive for BB&T. So we feel good about the economy, we feel good about the optimism, we feel good about our performance as we go forward. So let me turn it over to Daryl now for some more color. Daryl Bible : Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to talk about credit quality, improving margins and strong fee income, well-managed expenses and our guidance for 2019. Turning to Slide 7. Credit quality results this quarter continue to be very strong. Net charge-offs totaled $143 million, up 3 basis points over the third quarter '18 and 2 basis points compared to last year. This quarter's increase reflects seasonality in the consumer portfolio. Our NPAs are at historic low levels with an NPA ratio at 26 basis points. This is primarily driven by a decline in nonperforming C&I loans. There was a slight NPA increase in several smaller portfolios. Continuing on Slide 8. Our allowance coverage ratios remain strong at 2.76 times for net charge-offs and 2.99 times for NPLs. The allowance to loans ratio was 1.05%, flat from last quarter. Excluding loans and acquisitions from -- the allowance-to-loan ratio was 1.09% versus 1.11% last quarter. We recorded a provision of $146 million compared to net charge-offs of $143 million. This resulted in a small allowance build at $3 million this quarter. Turning to Slide 9. The reported net interest margin was 3.49%, up 2 basis points. Core margin was 3.40%, up 3 basis points. The core margin increase reflects our asset sensitivity coupled with the September rate hike. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities rose 14 basis points versus 12 basis points last quarter. The increase in large time deposits impacted the increase in interest-bearing liability costs. Asset sensitivity showed a modest reduction from last quarter. Our loan portfolio continues to be balanced between fixed and floating loans. Continuing on Slide 10. Noninterest income was $1.2 billion. Our fee income ratio was down slightly to 42%. Excluding the decrease of $36 million in nonqualified income, fee income was up $32 million or 10.4% annualized. Insurance income increased $39 million, mostly due to seasonality and strong new business. Regions Insurance acquisition contributed $34 million in revenue. Even when you exclude Regions, insurance income was up 8.4% from last year. This is a strong performance. We also saw record investment banking and brokerage fees in the quarter, which is up 25% from fourth quarter '17. Other income was down $77 million, mostly due to less SBIC gains and nonqualified income. Turning to Slide 11. Our expense management continues to be strong. Adjusted noninterest expense came in just over $1.7 billion, up slightly from a year ago, which includes Regions Insurance and the nonqualified expense. Excluding merger and restructuring charges, Regions and the nonqualified expense, expenses were up $23 million from last quarter and $20 million from a year ago. Including the Regions acquisition, average net FTEs decreased 381 versus third quarter of '18, and we are down almost 1,200 for the full year. Merger-related charges increased $58 million, primarily due to severance and facility write-downs. We're doing a great job controlling expenses and that contributed to positive adjusted operating leverage versus last quarter and last year. Continuing on Slide 12. Our capital and liquidity remain strong. Common equity Tier 1 totaled 10.2%. Our dividend ratio was 41 -- payout ratio was 41%, and our total payout ratio was 91%. Common shares repurchased was $375 million in fourth quarter. The LCR ratio came down 11 percentage points due to an unfriendly funding change. Turning to Slide 13. Note, we have a new format for our segments with a focus on revenue and its drivers. Community Bank Retail and Consumer Finance net income was $384 million, a decrease of $9 million from last quarter. The $17 million revenue increase was driven by a $17.5 million increase from deposit spreads, which improved 11 basis points, loan balance growth of $624 million, and a $3 million increase in service charges on deposits, partly offset by $7 million decrease in loan spreads with a decline of 5 basis points. Loan production fell from last quarter due to a seasonal decline in auto, Sheffield and mortgage. The decline in the deposits was driven by seasonality and industry trends. Continuing on Slide 14. Community Bank commercial net income was $329 million, an increase of $19 million from last quarter. Revenue improved $23 million, primarily due to a $22 million increase from deposit spreads improving 14 basis points. An increase in dealer floor plan balances was offset by declines in C&I and CRE. Loan production was up 11% from last quarter, driven by strong C&I production. Turning to Slide 15. Financial Services and Commercial Finance net income was $155 million, an increase of $6 million from last quarter. Revenue increased $29 million, driven by record investment banking and brokerage fees and loan growth. C&I loans drove the loan growth in the quarter. C&I and CRE loan production increased $2.8 billion over the prior quarter on strong demand for credit. Interest-bearing deposits decreased as we chose to fund the corporation with lower cost sources. Turning to Slide 16. Insurance Holdings' net income totaled $77 million, an increase of $34 million from last quarter. Revenue increased $44 million from last quarter due to PNC seasonality, increased life insurance commissions as a result of improved production and an increase in performance-based commissions. On a like-quarter basis, organic revenue growth was 9.5%. On Slide 17, you will see our outlook. Looking to the first quarter, we expect total loans held for investment will be up 1% to 3% annualized linked quarter due to seasonality in some of our loan portfolios. We expect net charge-offs to be in the range of 35 to 45 basis points, and the provision is expected to match charge-offs plus loan growth. And based on the current flatter and lower yield curve, we expect GAAP margin to be relatively flat and core margin to be up slightly versus linked quarter. Fee income to be up 3% to 5% versus like quarter, and expense is expected to be up 1% to 3% versus like quarter. And finally, we expect our effective tax rate of 20% to 21%. Full year guidance has not changed from what we discussed at our Investor Day in November. We're positioned better with loan growth momentum starting in 2019 than any other time in the last decade. Our insurance business, banking business are positioned well for continued growth. We have financial flexibility to contain costs and invest in the business. We continue to generate and grow revenues faster than expenses, resulting in positive operating leverage. In summary, the quality of earnings this quarter was excellent, resulting in record revenues and adjusted earnings, positive adjusted operating leverage, good loan growth, very strong credit quality and excellent expense management. Now let me turn it back over to Kelly for closing remarks and Q&A. Kelly King : Thanks, Daryl. As just emphasized, again, we believe overall it was a very good year. Solid earnings, record $3.1 billion for the year, great returns, adjusted internal tangible common at 20.4%, good loan growth at 3.6%, margin increased as Daryl described, adjusted expenses up slightly for the quarter, but down for the year, positive operating leverage, asset quality was great, and most important of all, we made excellent progress in our D2T, Disrupt to Thrive, initiative, where we are building the new bank, while controlling expenses. And for that reason, we believe our best days are ahead. Rich? Richard Baytosh : Thank you, Kelly. Andrea, at this time, if you would come back on the line and explain to our listeners how they can participate in the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Lana Chan from BMO Capital Markets. Lana Chan : I just wanted to -- couple of questions. One is on the expense outlook for 2019. I just want to make sure the base for 2018 is minus just the $146 million of merger charges? Daryl Bible : Yes. So the base is just excluding the merger-related charges. So -- I mean, if you look Lana in 2017 and 2018, we were basically right at $6.8 billion excluding restructuring charges. So that's really the base that we're guiding for '19. Lana Chan : Okay, great. And does your guidance still include 2 rate hikes for 2019? Daryl Bible : No. We have a curve and our forecast now that basically has no Fed increases in there, and we have a pretty flat curve throughout the year. So that's what we're forecasting off of right now. If you look into 2020, you might actually have a potential drop in the curve, but right now, just dealing with '19, it's flat on the Fed and a relatively flat curve across maturities. Lana Chan : Okay. And then just one more question in terms of the CD cost. Can you tell us what the incremental new cost of the CDs is coming in at? Daryl Bible : I would say if you look at our promotional retail CDs that we're offering, we have a 2% special in the 12-month range. And I think if we go out a little longer in term, we're in the 2.5% range. So on the marginal CD dollar probably be split between, they'll probably more go in to the shorter end of that. But overall that the CD renewal cost is significantly lower than that, but on the margin that's what's driving that incremental growth. This quarter, we did choose to fund more in euro-dollar time deposits, which is driving up the total interest-bearing deposit costs. And that's really priced off of LIBOR. It's usually like a LIBID rate. So if you look at 3 months LIBOR right now, we're at 277. So we're probably in the 260 to 265 range. Operator : We will now take our next question from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Just a couple of questions. One is on the loan growth. And Kelly, you mentioned how you've got some acceleration in C&I. Maybe you could speak to some of the -- not only areas that is driving that, but how much you think there is legs to that outlook or that asset class? And then also on the resi side, is that acceleration more decisioning on your part to retain rather than securitized? So just a couple comments there will be helpful. Kelly King : Yes. Betsy, the C&I acceleration is really bifurcated between our Corporate Banking initiative and also our Community Bank, which is doing very, very well. We're seeing strong growth in industrials and energy, consumer discretionary and information technology. Our Main Street is very much across the board and it's not driven by CREs. I mean, the CRE is actually -- it's all -- we're being very tight in terms of underwriting. So it's good solid, what we would call, traditional C&I. And yes, the resi mortgage is about just retaining the high-quality, better yielding purchases instead we look at whether direct or through acquisition. And so what -- as I indicated earlier, what we're seeing today is that we're getting better yield relative to risk than we were seeing a couple of years ago. And so that's what's kind of what's driving resi. Betsy Graseck : Yes, okay. Because I was just wondering on the C&I side, obviously, the parts of the capital markets were closed at the end of 4Q. And wondering if your C&I loan growth was impart a function of that and borrowers needing to go to banks as opposed to capital markets. Is there any... Kelly King : Yes, absolutely, Betsy. Finally, I think the capital markets has figured out that there is a lot of the risk in highly leveraged financing transactions and so the right decision to gap out and companies were coming back to the bank market. And that's really good for us because I mean, for some banks, they lose it on the capital market side, but they may pick up some on the loan side. We don't lose it on the capital market side because we don't participate in that, we just pick it up when traditional financing picks up. Daryl Bible : Yes. We had good loan growth even with seasonal portfolios down in the quarter with warehouse and premium finance and others. So when we started, the year-end balance is really strong. Kelly King : And maybe yield and dealer floor plan is strong. Betsy Graseck : Okay, now that's helpful. And then just separately, I wanted to ask about... Kelly King : Did we lose you, Betsy? Operator : Yes, we did, sir. [Operator Instructions] Daryl Bible : Maybe go on to the next one. Kelly King : Betsy, you can come back. We lost you at the end. Operator : Yes, Betsy is here now again. I will just queue her up there. Betsy Graseck : Oh, sorry about that. Okay. So then just separately on Page 12 of the slide deck, you talked about a plan to repurchase $425 million shares in 1Q '19. Could you just speak to that bullet point? And is that a pull forward of the second half? Or is that an add-on? Daryl Bible : No, Betsy. This is just part of our normal plan that we had authorization for, for CCAR 2018, and I think it was around $1.7 billion in total. Remember, we used some of that up on the acquisition of Regions in the third quarter of last year. So on Investor Day, we talked about increasing and levering up the company potentially down to 9.75 to 9.5. We're still waiting for the Fed and the NPR and comment letters, I think, are due, I think, in the next week or so and then they've to go through their process. But as that actually gets approved, we'll layer into CCAR '19 what we expect to do, and then we'll probably announce what we're going to do sometime towards the end of the second quarter or early third quarter. Betsy Graseck : Right, okay. And so is this 1Q '19 run rate of $425 million, do you think you'll likely do as well in 2Q '19? Kelly King : Yes, ma'am. Yes, very consistent with our CCAR '18. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Yes, I just wanted to make sure that -- because you put 1Q '19, just wanted to make sure. Operator : We will now take our next question from John McDonald from Bernstein. John McDonald : Wanted to ask a couple questions on the 2019 outlook. Sounds like you could have some setup for some very nice operating leverage for this year. And I would kind of just wanted to ask you to help us think through the fixed variable nature of your expense base. How do you keep cost flat irrespective of 2% to 4% revenue growth? Kelly King : So John, it's tricky and it's hard, but what we are really intensely focused on is, this, we keep calling it, the D2T, Disrupt to Thrive, initiative. But what it really is, is a broad-based, across the company look at reconceptualizing our businesses and making sure that we are efficient. We're looking at layers of management and spans of control. And we are finding lots of ways, frankly, to be more efficient and more effective, resulting in expense savings. And so what we are doing is we're shifting a lot of that expense into new initiatives, think digital, more marketing, et cetera, and then some of them fall in to the bottom line. So it's probably like 60%, 70% being reinvested into business and 30% to 40% being -- falling to the bottom line. So -- but we could have more fall in to bottom line, but we just think now is the time to invest for the future. So that's why you are able to get revenue growth and flat expenses is because we are just -- we're doing a really good job, our people are, in terms of reconceptualizing their business. Otherwise, if you just kept doing things that they where to do -- what you did yesterday, you're right, you can see expenses go up proportionate to revenue, but it's a whole new day and a new approach at BB&T. John McDonald : Okay. And the restructuring charge was pretty large this quarter. Is there a reason that was particularly large this quarter? And would you expect to have a continuation in the absence of actual mergers or acquisitions? Would you expect to have restructuring charges continue this year? Daryl Bible : Yes. So John, it was high this quarter. 2/3 of it was severance costs related to our expanding layers initiative that we started in the fourth quarter and then the other 1/3 was in real estate. If you look at 2018, we had just under $150 million in merger and restructuring charges. My guess right now is about -- will be less in '19, $75 million to $100 million, more focused around real estate write-downs as we continue to pose more retail branches, maybe some back-office consolidations and some space. But we still have some severance charges into '19, but not as much as what we're seeing right now. John McDonald : Okay. And then last thing was, Daryl, on the revenue growth outlook, the 2% to 4%, could you give us a little bit of a sense of the split there between net interest income and fees? What is the bigger driver as you think about the revenue outlook for '19? Daryl Bible : Yes. So I would say it's probably weighted 60% in fees and maybe 40% in NII. It's really a function of a flatter curve that we're seeing right now, but that can ebb and flow to a little bit. We're having really good loan growth. And if we keep our margins stable, we're going to have strong NII growth. So we have to see how the year plays out. But right now, we have unbelievably strong momentum in insurance, on investment banking and brokerage and even our retail fee businesses are performing nicely and growing. So I would say fee businesses overall are showing strength and then our loan growth is strong. Operator : We will now take our next question from Ms. Jennifer Demba from SunTrust. Jennifer Demba : Your asset quality continues to be excellent. Just curious on a couple of items. We've heard a lot of rhetoric about leverage -- the leverage loan market being very competitive right now. I'm just wondering what kind of exposure you guys have there? And what kind of lending you're doing there? Clarke Starnes : Jennifer, this is Clarke. Just remind you all from Investor Day, we only have about $1 billion of leveraged finance, and it would not be on the very aggressive end. It's typically long-term companies we know that might be doing an M&A transaction and would be bringing that leverage down pretty quickly. So it's pretty well underwritten. So it's about $1 billion. We also have no meaningful indirect exposure to anything like CLOs or BDC. So really that's about it. So it's less than 1% of our total loan portfolio. Jennifer Demba : Okay. A separate question. I know pay downs were pretty high for the industry last year. I'm just curious what you guys saw in the fourth quarter relative to the rest of the quarters in 2018? Clarke Starnes : Substantially less. Obviously, on the C&I side, we did benefit from some of the capital markets noise, if you will. We did see less pay downs, and we actually saw greater utilization probably almost 200 basis points on our undrawn commitments. So that was nice. Where we saw more pay downs and continue to see it's really just normal projects on our CRE portfolio going to market, and whereas Kelly said, we're trying to be very prudent about new originations. So we did see some pay down there, but it was more just normal. Operator : We will now take our next question from Mr. Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Kelly, can you talk a little more about the noninterest-bearing deposits. You mentioned how they were down slightly because more of the customers are using them to -- put them to work in your businesses? If interest rates don't go any higher this year, do you think that there will be a stabilization in the noninterest-bearing deposits? Or if your customers continue to see growth opportunities, we should see these noninterest-bearing deposits decline throughout the year? Kelly King : Well, I think to your point, Gerard, and when I think if rates accelerate, you'll see that trend accelerate because the marginal cost of funding a project becomes more expensive if you use all the people's money versus your own. If they remain stable, I think you'll see this factor leveling out because remember, companies will feel very, very risk with players out there particularly the baby boomers which happen to lead most of these companies. And so keeping disproportionate low level of liquidity is still a very attractive psychological concept that is driving a lot of behavior. So obviously, nobody knows, but my own personal feeling is if rates go up, it will continue; if rates stabilize it will -- that trend will stabilize as well. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then as a follow up, you guys mentioned that credit today is very good and it goes back or hearkens back to maybe 2006 before the financial crisis. When we go back and look at your return on equity in that time period, it was obviously high at 15% to 16%, return on tangible common equity was almost 27%, ROAs were a bit higher. As we go forward, how do you think you can bring your ROE up above where it is today, just over 11% granted? I understand it won't get to those levels that we saw back in '06 because of the higher capital and liquidity levels you carry. But is it going to be more of a ROA numerator type of number driving ROE net income that is? Or will we see actually management of the equity since your balance sheet is so much stronger today and derisk compared to where it was 10 years ago? Kelly King : Well, that's question we are all pondering, Gerard, and it's a really good one. If you look at -- if you really look at ROE today on an adjusted basis, it maybe higher than it was in 2006 because equity has about doubled. And so as far as I think, actually comparable ROE is very high today and -- on an adjusted basis. Still if you operate from the 11% today looking forward, what I expect is that, again, assuming no huge existential event, I think you'll gradually see ROE go up as equities become more normalized. You saw in Investor Day us beginning to move towards a more normalized ROE with a target of 9.50 to 9.75 quarters. Obviously, that drives directly into ROE. So I think the bigger driver of ROE will be the E, but then I think as profitability gets better through all of the things we're doing in terms of making our business better, that will drive ROE. So we see consistent upward pressure on ROE and then, of course, return on tangible will kind of follow that. So we're pretty encouraged. I remember 35 years ago being on a meeting, we spent 3 days figuring out if we could ever get ROA to 1% and ROE to 15%. Back then, 8% was stronger. And so it was -- so now -- as you know, it's a big tradeoff to win ROE and ROA. So we have a very, very strong ROA today, much stronger than ever just because we're having a stronger E which drives that ROA. Over time, what I'd like to see is ROE come up better with the deleveraging -- I mean, with stronger deleveraging and ROA come down some. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will now take our next question from Mr. Saul Martinez from UBS. Saul Martinez : First more of a detailed question. Just want to make sure that I understand the numbers around the deferred compensation hits to noninterest income and expenses. Is that -- the $36 million reduction to other income, is that fully offset in the expense line? And I ask because in the -- on Page 11, it says an $18 million benefit for nonqualified deferred comp in the first bullet, it says $36 million in the second. And I think the text kind of implies that it's primarily offset. So I just want to make sure I understand the 2 moving parts and whether they fully offset each other. Daryl Bible : Yes, Saul, it's Daryl. It is dollar for dollar offset. So it's other income and personnel cost is where you see that the entries made and they cancel out each quarter. We just saw a big move in the market as you saw in December, which caused the big change. I mean, otherwise, we would have had really strong fee revenue growth and our expense guidance would still be within the range. Saul Martinez : Right, right. Okay, got it . Just want to make sure I -- that I got that right. Okay. And then, I guess, on the insurance business, pretax margins moved up a bit this quarter. Can you just remind us sort of how you think about the glide path get towards getting towards your -- I think it was a 30% goal. How long does it take? And also just the trends in that business in terms of what you're seeing in volumes, client retention, pricing, all the things that help drive the top line of that business? Christopher Henson : Right, happy to. This is Chris, Saul. Yes, actually, the target was really just to try to get in that 25%, 26% range over about a 3-year period, and we made a really nice move this year into the 22%, 23% range from about 19%. And the pieces are -- as you might recall we sort of displayed at Investor Day, John Howard, our President really kind of walked through the process of that, and we really begin to transform and remake that business really from top to bottom beginning back in April. And out of that flowed 31 initiatives that we're following up on over that period of time and some of them will actually take 2 to 3 years to invest in and see the benefit from, but we're actually seeing the traction from that today. But to get to the pieces that you asked for, pricing, this -- really most of this year was about, I'd say, 2.5, some minusing three is kind of leveled off to about the 2 range. Client retention, we think we're industry leading in the 92-plus range. But far and away what's driving our business is new business production really because of strong economy. And new business production in fourth quarter was up 10%, year-to-date is up 11.4%. This is the strongest numbers I remember seeing in my time working with insurance over the last 10 years. So very, very strong, which led -- those 3 pieces led the core organic growth in the fourth quarter of 9.5% and the year-to-date number of 6%. And we think the industry is probably in the 4.5% kind of range. So we believe we're industry leading with the 6% number. And we've got a number of operating improvements that are in process too like implementing certainly the synergies from Regions. We currently -- Regions is accretive to our margin already. We've made really nice improvements to that business and it's been nice. We've implemented robotics, again, to get cost take out, reconceptualizing our EB business. So lot going on there. But -- so that kind of is looking back. Looking forward, you had -- recall fall of '17 about $100 billion in loss exposure and that gave us a little support for pricing and gave you more 2.5 this year. You just recently had one of the second largest hits with the wildfires and Michael of about $80 million in hit, which we think is not enough to really move pricing, but it's enough to hold it, we think, for the balance of the year about a 2% kind of range. So we would expect looking forward in the first quarter about 4.5% kind of move, and we think economic expansion will continue to drop new business growth. And at the end of the day, because we're really disproportionately stronger in property, which is in the up 2.5%, 3% range right now and small accounts in the similar range, we expect the market, so the U.S. market, to be up in the 3% to 5% range, and we certainly expect to be at the top end of that range kind of looking forward. So we feel very, very good about future outlook for insurance as we kind of go forward. Saul Martinez : Okay. And just to clarify when you say the 3% to 5% range, you're talking about overall revenue? Christopher Henson : Organic. Saul Martinez : That's organic. Christopher Henson : Organic growth. Saul Martinez : Organic growth. Christopher Henson : Organic growth. Saul Martinez : Okay, right. So that would include pricing and new business production in that? Christopher Henson : It would. We would expect to meet top end of that range possibly or above it. Operator : We will now take our next question from Stephen Scouten with Sandler O'Neill. Stephen Scouten : I wanted to think about -- maybe a pretty high-level question. If you were looking at your 2019 guidance, and you kind of look to where you thought you could outperform the existing guidance, where is this kind of positive tension points, whether it'd be loan growth expenses or otherwise where you might focus more attention because you think there's more potential upside than you're currently guiding? Kelly King : I'll my give you my reactions. This is Kelly. I think on the upside, there is some upside on the loan area, but our numbers look relatively strong versus the industry. But if certainly -- if the economy accelerates from what we're projecting, that's an upside, which would translate into higher upside on revenue -- on revenue side. I think credit quality is so low, there's not much chance of it getting better, but I don't think there's much chance to getting lower unless the economy goes into crisis. So it's kind of stable. Tax rate is kind of stable. Expenses are already very good at flat. So I'd call it upside potential in the loan and revenue side. Stephen Scouten : Okay. Helpful. And then maybe if I'm thinking about the move up in time deposits this quarter, could you speak to a little bit how you guys are thinking about your funding composition moving forward? And how you think about your NIM relative to the potential for migration into higher cost funding sources, the push and pull between the migration versus the potential for higher rate than which I think, I guess, as a bigger risk moving forward? Daryl Bible : Yes. So we take a balanced approach to how we fund the company. We want to make sure we have good laddered maturities, and we also have any big [voyages] in any large maturities maturing at any one point. It's balanced, but we be basically, Donna, our Treasurer, and her team basically are instructed to fund the company at the lowest cost that they can within the liquidity parameters that we have. This quarter, they moved a lot of their marginal funding into euro-dollar time deposits. This quarter, we are being much more aggressive on the retail side. We have good promotions out in MMDA accounts and in retail CDs. And it's really a mixed bag as how she is the funding of the company. But her job is to manage the overall liability costs and make sure our margins stay the best that they can, but still prudently within liquidity standards that we have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will now take our next question from John Pancari from Evercore ISI. John Pancari : On the -- back to the outlook. Regarding the loan growth outlook, we know the loan growth for the quarter just seemed to have come in a little bit better than expected. And your -- but you maintained your full year '19 outlook range of 2% to 4%. Can you talk about if there is the likelihood for an upward revision there if we see loan growth holding at these levels? Kelly King : Yes. Certainly, if we have the kind of production that we had in the last few months, the kind of -- which resulted in a very strong AOP. If payoff remain low, which they have been, which is a nice change. If utilizations continue to increase, which will be driven by the capital markets and other things we talked about, yes, there is definitely some upside there. And the big wild card is just what happens to sentiment out there in terms of the economy. And right now, as I indicated, optimism sentiment is still strong, but there is a lot of chatter out there around the government shutdown and all of that and that drives people's thinking, although in long-term I don't think it influences much decision, but it doesn't in short-term. So if that upsides and that will call people to be more optimistic and more bullish and result in more upside regarding loan growth. If on the other hand, if we were to accelerate you could talk people into being scared, and that would decelerate. So it's a bit hard to predict right now because of these external factors. But a most likely scenario is what we said, 3% to 4% which is very strong and -- for the year and with certainly some reasonable initiative to look to the high side of that. John Pancari : Got it, got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then separately on the margin. Could you just talk to us about how the margin should progress if the Fed does not hike from here? How do you see that the dynamics playing out in the next couple quarters? Could you still see some incremental expansion? Daryl Bible : Yes. John, this is Daryl. What I would tell you is, remember, we are balanced. So about half of our loans are short and half are longer term. But while the curve is flatter the longer end of the curve the loans that are rolling over out there and our securities are still reprising up higher, and we also have our specialty businesses out there that are basically just have a high risk-adjusted yield. So we have tools in our toolkits that offset the drag you are going to see on the deposit costs. So if you don't get anymore Fed increases this year and you're still going to see deposit costs go up some in the next couple quarters, they won't have betas like they have right now, like we're in the low-40s beta with deposit costs up 12. It would probably go to mid-single digit and then dribble down as the year went on. But as long as our fixed assets are repricing up higher, we can offset that. So I'm feeling pretty good that core margin is flat to maybe up slightly. You still have the burn off of reported GAAP margin, but I feel pretty good about on the core side, we can keep that relatively flat and maybe up a little bit. John Pancari : Got it, got it. And then related to that, the LCR -- the modified LCR ratio came down by about 11 percentage point. Do you still see it around 115% by year-end? Daryl Bible : We're going to manage that ratio. We'll see what happens with the Fed NPR. Our decision to fund that little a bit on the shorter and with some wholesale funding this quarter has brought it down some and that was Donna's decision and that was the right decision to do, it saved us some money and produced the higher net interest margin for us. So she is doing all the right things and has the flexibility to continue to do that. Operator : We will now take our last question from Mr. Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott : Just wanted a bit of help trying to understand something you were talking about earlier. You seem to be saying that capital markets had figured out that they were taking a lot of risk and it was good that they were pulling back. But at the same time loan growth in the bank sector has accelerated. So how should we find some comfort that we're not just seeing that there risk migrate out of the capital markets and back onto bank balance sheets? Kelly King : Well, I think you're seeing some of the capital market risk move back onto some bank's balance sheets not moving bank on ours. And so yes, you did see more of a fluidity between some banks in terms of the way to think about capital markets, credit exposure and their own balance sheet credit exposure. We see them very, very differently. And so our growth is driven by a more Main Street type of financing not capital markets movement back and forth. But that's an insightful question is true to some aggregate levels not true for BB&T. Geoffrey Elliott : Understood. And then if I could follow-up with a different topic, if that's okay. The consent orders around BSA/AML, I think you were released from the FDIC consent order back in the summer. But if I understand correctly the Fed consent order is still outstanding. Can you give us an update on what's happening there? What work you are doing? How much longer you think that could still apply? Kelly King : Yes. You're exactly right. The FDIC in the state lifted consent orders some time ago, but the Fed's reigns outstanding. The -- it's all the same activity, it's all about building out a robust BSA/AML program, which we have done. We had a remaining project, automation project that was scheduled to be completed by the end of the year, which was completed. So literally all of the work that needed to be done from any of the regulators has been done. We're just in a little period now where the final validations by the Fed are still in motion. I would expect, frankly, that Fed's order to be lifted in the relatively near term. Obviously, I can't control that. But there is no reason for it to be any protracted period of time because all the feedback that we have is that we have done everything that we have been asked to do and that has been totally validated by all of our internal people and some external validations through consultants. And so we have no reason to expect that the final validations by the Fed would result in any different than our internal people and our outside consultants validations. Geoffrey Elliott : Understood. And do you think that changes the approach around M&A at all once you've got that Fed order lifted? Daryl Bible : Well, Geoffrey, as I said at the Investor Conference, we are laser-focused on the initiatives you heard us talk about, and we're very excited about our D2T, Disrupt to Thrive, initiative. It had excellent momentum. We're making great progress. Our people are excited about it. And you see the results of it in terms of expenses management, you see the results in terms of our businesses like what Chris talked about in insurance and our relatively strong loan growth. So all other parts of our business are very much embraced in this reconceptualization process and is going very well. Operator : I would now like to hand the call back to Mr. Richard Baytosh for any additional or closing remarks. Richard Baytosh : Okay. Thank you, Andrea, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. If you have any additional questions feel free to reach us to me, and we can discuss later. Thank you, and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

And now I'll turn it over to Kelly. Kelly King : Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our call. So we think the first quarter was a very good start to the year. We had record adjusted EPS, strong returns, strategic loan growth, very good expense control and excellent asset quality and very importantly, a great strategic move in terms of our MOE with SunTrust, which I'll talk about in a bit. Our net income was $749 million, up 0.5% versus the first quarter of '18. Our net income, excluding merger-related and restructuring charges, was a record $813 million, up 6% versus the first quarter of '18. We did have diluted EPS, which was $0.97, up 3.2%. We did wrap up our disrupt-to-thrive initiatives, which you know we've been working on for better part of year and half. We wrapped that up this quarter and we did announce SunTrust MOE, so we have some substantial charges related to that. So as a result, our first quarter adjusted diluted EPS was a record $1.05, which is up 8.2% versus the first quarter of '18. Our adjusted ROA, ROCE and ROTCE, respectively, were 1.55%, 12.01% and a very strong 19.86%. I'm on Slide 4. Followings the highlights, our taxable equivalent revenue was 2.9% (sic) [$2.9 billion], which was down 5.7% annualized versus the fourth quarter. Of course, remember there's some seasonality there, but I think a very good 3% increase versus the first quarter of '18. Loans held for investment averaged $148 billion, up 1.4% annualized versus the fourth quarter. Our reported NIM increased 2 basis points to 3.51% and our core NIM increased 4 basis points. Insurance income was very strong, a record $510 million, up 19.2% annualized versus fourth quarter, and Chris will give you some specific information on that in just a bit. Our adjusted efficiency was essentially flat at 56.6% versus 56.5%, which, as you know, is very strong from an industry point of view. And our adjusted non-interest expenses totaled $1.7 billion, which was down 4.7% annualized versus the fourth quarter. So we're doing exactly what we said in terms of maintaining extremely strong expense control. Our credit quality was great. Nonperforming asset ratio was 0.26%, flat versus fourth quarter and a decrease of 4 basis points versus the first quarter of '18. Charge-offs were 40 basis points versus 38 in the fourth quarter with some seasonality impact there, but lower than the 41 basis points in the first quarter of '18. We did announce strategically our combination with SunTrust, which we're very excited about. We'll talk about that in just a little bit. And related to the merger, we did suspend share repurchases in anticipation of that combination. On Slide 5, you will see the merger-related and restructuring charges I referred to. It was $80 million on our pretax, 64 after-tax, so an $0.08 negative impact on EPS from a GAAP point of view. If you follow along on Slide 6, we'll look at loan growth. It's kind of interesting what's going on in loan growth. So our total loan growth was 1.4%, which is not super strong, but remember, we focus on the categories more than we do the aggregate and our C&I was a strong 5.5%. Now our CRE was down 7.5%, but that's really because of our focus on conservative underwriting, and so we actually feel good about that as we move through the quarter. We had a strong performance in Corporate Banking, Community Banking, equipment finance and equipment capital finance. We did see a lot of competition in the market this year - I mean this quarter, particularly in CRE underwriting is really, really very competitive. And as I indicated, we are simply not willing to go where some are with regard to CRE underwriting and so that's why we saw the softness there. Retail was overall strategically where we wanted it to be. Residential mortgage saw a 3.5% annualized increase. Our direct was down 3.7%, but we are finally seeing the bottom that we have been projecting. We've been doing a lot of things in terms of restructuring our direct offerings and our processes. Volumes are increasing. So we see that bottoming kind of as we expected. And then indirect was soft this quarter, but, as you know, we always have that particularly driven by Sheffield. So overall, we were pleased with loan growth for the quarter. If you look at Page 7, Slide 7, on deposits. Total deposits were up 5.7%. Now we are seeing a shift here that we just want to mention. Our non-interest-bearing deposits were down 10.9% versus the fourth annualized. Now on a year-over-year, it was 2.1%. So the 2.1% is a meaningful number to look at. And that's really not a function of losses to BB&T as much as it is movement between DDA to interest-bearing accounts. The market has finally gotten sensitive to interest rates. And so as we expected, we would see some internal and external disintermediation and that's occurring, although we're pleased that most of ours is just internal shifting. We think that will continue to occur, but probably at a decelerating pace, that remains to be seen, that we're on a whole new world in terms of how people are responding to this still relatively low interest rate environment, so we'll see how that works out. The percentage of non-interest-bearing deposits to total funds was 32.7% versus 34%, so that reflects that softness in that. Overall, I would just say that our cost was a little higher, our betas were a little higher this quarter. Daryl will give you some detail on that, but it was mostly because of a substantial marketing effort that we had in terms of some markets that we were concerned about some market share dilution, and so we ramped up our marketing efforts in the first quarter and we think that'll ramp back down as we head into the second and third quarter. So Daryl will give you a little more color on that, but I just want to explain it was - the beta increase was not independent of marketing strategic actions that we chose to make. So with that, let me turn it over to Daryl. Daryl Bible : Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to talk about our excellent credit quality, margin and fee income dynamics, strong expense management and provide guidance for the second quarter and full year 2019. Turning to Slide 8. Credit quality remained strong. Net charge-offs of $147 million were up 2 basis points and improved 1 basis point from a year ago. This quarter's increase reflects an uptick in CRE and seasonal revolving credit, offset by a decline in lease financing and the mortgage portfolio. Our NPA ratio of 26 basis points was unchanged and remains historically low. Continuing on Slide 9. Our allowance coverage ratios remained strong at 2.62 times net charge-offs and 2.97 times NPLs. The allowance to loan ratio was 1.05%, unchanged from last quarter. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $155 million, which exceeded net charge-offs of $147 million. This resulted in an allowance build of $8 million in the first quarter. Turning to Slide 10. The reported net interest margin was 3.51%, up 2 basis points. The core margin rose 4 basis points to 3.44%. The improvement was driven by dividends received on assets for certain post-employment benefits, which occurs in the first quarter of every year. This added 4 basis points to the margin. This dividend income is partially offset by higher personnel expense. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities rose 13 basis points, a modest deacceleration from last quarter's 14 basis point increase. Balance growth and time deposits and money market and savings drove the interest-bearing liability costs higher. We expect the rate of increase in interest-bearing liability costs to significantly moderate next quarter. Asset sensitivity declined due to an increase in fixed-rate assets and a decrease in DDA. Continuing on Slide 11. Non-interest income of $1.2 billion grew 1.9% versus like quarter. However, our fee income ratio declined 50 basis points to 41.5% as record insurance income was offset by declines in other fee categories. Insurance income increased $23 million, reflecting seasonality and solid organic growth. Regions Insurance contributed $46 million to the insurance income. Excluding Regions, insurance income rose 6.4% from the like quarter reflecting continued strong organic growth. Investment banking and brokerage fees and commissions declined $28 million following a record fourth quarter of '18. In addition, mortgage banking income decreased $23 million due to seasonally lower commercial and residential volumes. Service charges on deposits declined $14 million as there were fewer revenue days, but up 3.6% versus last year. Other income rose $18 million primarily due to income on assets for certain post employment benefits, which is offset by higher personnel expense. Turning to Slide 12. Our expense management continues to be strong. Adjusted non-interest expense, which excludes MRRCs was $1.7 billion, a decrease of $20 million. Compared to the first quarter of '18, adjusted non-interest expense increased $30 million. However, excluding Regions Insurance, this quarter's adjusted expense was about flat versus last year. Personnel expense declined $9 million due to lower salary expense with 518 fewer FTEs. Professional services expense declined $12 million primarily due to lower consulting expense. Merger-related and restructuring charges increased $4 million largely due to investment banking fees related to the merger of equals. You will note that the current quarter's effective tax rate was down. This is primarily due to excess tax benefits from equity based compensation plans, which also occurred in the first quarter of last year. Continuing on Slide 13. Our capital and liquidity remained strong. Common equity Tier 1 capital increased to 10.3%, reflecting the suspension of share repurchases associated with the merger of equals. Our dividend payout ratio was strong at 41.3%. On April 5, BB&T submitted a stand-alone capital plan to the Fed requesting a common dividend increase for the third quarter from $0.405 to $0.45 per quarter. We expect the Board to authorize this at the July board meeting. Our modified average LCR ratio was 130%. Now let's turn to Slide 14 for - to review our segments. Community Banking Retail and Consumer Finance generated net income of $379 million, down $8 million. Revenue decreased $46 million driven by lower loan spreads and fewer revenue days impacting deposit service charges and a seasonal decline in payment-related fees. Loan production decreased due to softer mortgage market conditions and seasonality at Sheffield. We rolled out a new branch direct auto product in late February reducing the time frame for loan approval from over a day to just minutes. In just the first month, we saw a 225% increase in loan production, which translates into an annual run rate increase of about $500 million. This is a great example of how being more responsive can improve client service and benefit the bottom line. Continuing on Slide 15. Community Banking Commercial net income was $328 million, down $1 million. Revenue decreased $14 million driven by fewer days and a slight decrease in loan spreads, offset by an increase in deposit spreads. Loan production declined largely due to seasonality. Continuing to Slide 16. Financial Services and Commercial Finance net income was $156 million, up $1 million. Revenue decreased $40 million coming off record fourth quarter '18 investment banking and brokerage fees and commissions plus seasonally lower commercial mortgage banking income. Average loan balances increased 11.9% annualized driven primarily by Corporate Banking and C&I loans. Average deposit balances increased due to growth in wealth and Corporate Banking. Invested assets increased due to recovery in the equity markets. Turning to Slide 17. Insurance Holdings net income totaled $88 million, an increase of $11 million. Total revenue increased $20 million due to seasonality. The seasonal pickup and employee benefit commissions was partially offset by a seasonal decline in PNC commissions. Organic revenue grew 6.7% versus like quarter. Now I'll turn it over to Chris to provide more perspective on Insurance Holdings performance this quarter. Christopher Henson : Thanks, Daryl. Good morning. Primary purpose on these 2 slides really is to reinforce the transformation plan that you heard John Howard, our Chairman and CEO of Insurance Holdings, share with you at Investor Day this past fall is really in stride and working. As a reminder, he brought BCG in about a year ago and really looked at the business order from top to bottom, developed the transformation plan and is now executing on 31 initiatives that fell out with the plan. We have out of that, new operating models for retail, for wholesale, we've got revenue growth and expense reduction initiatives. As a result, the business really currently has significant momentum. And if you'll look at the upper right-hand chart, you can see that we're receiving strong results across all business lines. You can see revenues up linked quarter or like quarter 17.2%. And you recall, we did acquire Regions July 2, '18. So there is $46 million in revenues, as Daryl pointed out, included in first quarter '18. But if you exclude that, we still are up $33 million organically. Just as a reminder, there are three primary drivers to organic growth. First is pricing and we are in an environment where pricing is stabilizing in the plus 2% range. You'll recall, we have had two of the largest insurable loss years over the past 2 years with $150 billion hitting in 2017 because of the large three storms and another $80 billion in '18. So we've got good price support up for this year. Second driver of organic growth and far and away the biggest impact is new business growth. And our new business growth across all entities is up 8%, which is exceptionally strong and driven by really the strong economic environment. And then the third is high client retention rates. Our retail business retention rate is just below 92%, which is industry leading and then wholesale 76%. And so what that gives you is the chart at the lower left and you can see a nice improvement in organic growth of 3% a year ago, up to 6.7%. We believe this is going to be best-in-class. I believe when all the numbers come in at the industry, we'll probably average Q1 somewhere in the 4% to 5% range. So as I said, the economic fundamentals are still favorable. Looking forward, as business expands, you know businesses are building equipment, buying -- I mean, buildings, buying equipment, hiring employees does create insurable opportunities as we go forward. And so with that stability, there are still pockets of tightening in certain commercial lines like energy, commercial auto, which is up in the neighborhood of 7% in pricing and then transportation industry would be examples. If you turn with me to Page 19, you can see part of the reason for this plan was really continued focus on enhancing our margin across all the business lines. And you can see adjusted EBITDA in the upper left handed chart there, up 38.6% year-over-year or $39 million. About a third of that would be from Regions and the synergies from Regions. We're on target to achieve about 80% of those cost savings of 2019. In addition, there's revenue lift in the numbers as well. And then with - of course, organic growth and strong expense control are driving a margin expansion. I mentioned new business growth is the primary driver of organic growth, but expense control plays a big role. We mentioned the cost takeout in Regions, but we've also got personnel savings really across all entities within insurance business. About every entity has an automation program going in and some also include robotics implementations. And so if you'll look at what that has driven in the lower left chart, you can see the EBITDA margin has moved over the last year from 22% up to 26.1%, which is really a nice improvement. And so the focus in the business really is to optimize operations but with differentiation in data and analytics. And I would say, while that's true across the whole business, it's specifically true with wholesale, which is harder to place coverage and a riskier insurable opportunities where Daryl Bible and his team are really offering the ability to help better understand through analytics through risk and educate the underwriter on behalf of the client. So in summary, very proud of the progress that we've made in the year. We've got another couple of years of implementation, but really pleased with where we are at this point. I'll turn it back to Daryl. Daryl Bible : Thank you, Chris. Continuing on Slide 20, you will see our outlook. Looking to the second quarter, we expect average total loans held for investment to be up 4% to 6% annualized versus first quarter '19. Net charge-offs to be in the range of 35 to 45 basis points and the provision is expected to match charge-offs plus loan growth. We also expect both the GAAP and core net interest margins to be down 4 to 6 basis points from the first quarter. Fee income to be up 5% to 7% versus like quarter and expenses to be flat to up 2% versus like quarter. And finally, an effective tax rate of 20% to 21%. Full year guidance has not changed, but we have updated the effective tax rate to 20% from a range of 20% to 21% previously. We will continue to grow revenue faster than expenses, driving positive operating leverage as we move towards the MOE close with SunTrust. In summary, the quality of our earnings this quarter was excellent, resulting in record adjusted earnings, positive adjusted operating leverage versus last year, good loan growth, excellent credit quality and strong expense management. Now let me turn it back to Kelly for an update on the merger equals to SunTrust and closing remarks and Q&A. Kelly King : Thanks, Daryl. So let me update you all on kind of where we are. As you know, we announced this combination on February 7 and I would say that it is going extraordinarily well. Now remember, we said that fundamental foundations for this is that it is highly synergistic, it is financially compelling and it is transformative, and everything we've seen in the last couple of months just affirms that to be true. Bill and I and our teams are working together extraordinarily well. We started immediately having weekly meetings. We've already had eight weekly meetings, where we are reviewing and planning for the merger. Just this past week, we had our first team-building session at the BB&T leadership entity, which went extraordinarily well. So we're making really good progress in terms of the teams working together. We are working through the process of pulling the organization together in terms of how it will operate when we actually combine. So we've named integration leads across businesses and functions. We have outside consultants working with us on this, which is really, really helping. We're spending a lot of time focusing on risk oversight to make sure that we have that process nailed down very, very tightly. The merger application and registration statement was filed in early March. We are working with Interbrand, a global-leading brand agency to help us develop the new name and branding. Our cultures are very similar. However, we are still planning a process to be sure that we pull the cultures together in terms of terminology and how we talk about ourselves, but the fundamentals we knew in advance that were really firm, now are really very, very similar. We are in the process of holding listening sessions from the community, community groups, individuals because we really want to know what people have to say about this. We recognize this is a major combination. We recognize we have a major responsibility in terms of giving back to the community. Both organizations have done this as a matter of our moral commitment to the marketplace, but we believe we can do even more. So that's very exciting. We've already done four. We've got a couple of more to go. The feedback has been very, very positive. So in terms of next steps, the FRB and FDIC actually hold their public meetings to get feedback. Those are being held in Charlotte on April 25 and Atlanta on May 3rd. We will be submitting our joint capital plan and stress test in May. We'll be continuing to name additional business leaders as we move down through the organization. We expect to announce our new brand and new name in late second quarter. We will be finalizing the divestiture commitments and undertake the marketing process as we head into the second quarter and then the shareholder vote is expected in the early third quarter. We remain very confident in our projected $1.6 billion net cost savings. Remember, that is net of technological investments and HR expenses. So that is going very, very well. So in terms of our quarter, it was overall, I think, a very good quarter. We're extremely pleased about our progress also in working towards creating a premier financial institution. So a great quarter, outstanding strategic combination announced with a combination with us and SunTrust, and it really positions us to drive in a really challenging environment, so we can continue to focus on making the world a better place to live and focusing on lighting the way to financial well-being. So with that, I'll turn it back to Rich. Richard Baytosh : Thank you, Kelly. Before we start the Q&A session, we recognize there will be a lot of interest in getting an update on the merger planning and what's happened since the announcement on February 7 as well as our current expected timeline for things that unfold from here. So we'd like to have the Q&A to be a balance of questions about our stand-alone BB&T results and trends from the first quarter and merger questions. Leanne, at this time, if you'd come back on the line and explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. John McDonald : Hi, good morning. I just wanted to ask about on the stand-alone BB&T question. It feels like there's some cross currents on the net interest income outlook, Daryl, with loan growth picking up but the NIM seeing some pressure. So I guess the question is, what's the source of the 4 to 6 basis points of NIM pressure next quarter if the deposit betas are going to slow? And how does the NIM and loan growth dynamics feed into your NII growth outlook for 2Q and the full year? Daryl Bible : Yes. So this quarter, John, just like we have in other years, we have to record an entry in net interest income. It's basically on a deferred comp plan and it's the earnings that are generated out of the funds that are invested, the dividends that we receive. This quarter, it was $18 million. If you go back a year ago, it was $12 million. So last year, it was worth 3 basis points. This year, 4 basis points. That basically just comes out of net interest income. With the loan growth that we're projecting across all major loan categories, even though margin will be down, we still expect net interest income to be up in linked-quarter basis between first and second. We do benefit by an additional day, so that helps. But if you look on a year-over-year basis, we still are expecting our net interest income year-over-year to be up in the 2% to 3% range, so still positive revenue even with this margin guidance [ph]. John McDonald : Okay. Great. And then in terms of the MOE, as you've dug deeper into the financials, how does your view of the initial projection of earnings power change, if at all? On announcement day, you showed an illustrative 2021 EPS of $5.59. Just kind of wondering what type of refinements, positive or negative, you might have made to that? I know the S-4 came out and showed, for example, higher amortization on the one hand, but also higher purchase accounting. I know it's early, but any refinements you make to that initial crack of combined earnings power? Kelly King : John, I'll give you a broad answer and Daryl will give you in detail if you like, but no, nothing in aggregate. As you say, in a large combination like this, there are puts and takes. You get more detail, more specificity in terms of some of the projections, which early on, as you know, are necessarily broad-based and assumption based. But we're too much into it and I would say, in terms of the aggregates, we feel as confident as before, if not a tad more confident. The combination of the businesses, now that we've learned more, leave us very encouraged in terms of the complementary nature of these businesses. Remember, the big levers on this are the expense control. We feel very good about that. But the long-term enduring benefits are around, you know, are cross levering the benefit - the specialty focuses of SunTrust over BB&T and BB&T over SunTrust. And the more we've learned, the better we feel about that, so I would say net positive. Daryl Bible : Yeah, I'll just reiterate that, John. So we talked about five major categories where we would achieve the savings : facilities, retail, third-party vendors, technology and shared services. As we have met as a new co-management team and we talk about these, we feel extremely confident that we can achieve the $1.6 billion net number. We are in the process of getting more information and detail as our companies come together so we can plan to how basically allocate by all the business lines, so that it will be held accountable for these savings and still believe that we are very confident in achieving the net savings of $1.6 billion. As far as your accounting question goes, we really don't know what the rate environment is going to be when we close a transaction. We're looking at late third quarter or fourth quarter close. So interest rates will have some say on what their potential mark on our portfolio is. It's probably less now with rates down a little bit, but I'm not sure which way rates are going to go across the curve by the time we close. We will basically be reporting both GAAP and cash earnings for the foreseeable future because we're going to have a lot of non-cash expenses. Recall that non-cash expenses still fall to capital, so it is very accretive from a capital usage perspective, but we feel very confident in the projections that we gave a few months ago. John McDonald : Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Daryl, just on the capital comment that you just made, can you give us a sense as to how you're thinking through the combined capital position that you have? I mean what does it mean for capital return over the next couple of CCAR cycles? And I know part of that answer has to come with an assumption that the NPR that's out there is approved on advance to purchase banks, but maybe give us some color on if it is, if it isn't? Daryl Bible : So as we put the two balance sheets together, we will have purchase accounting MRRCs. What we said two months ago is that capital ratio should be between 9.75% and 10% and we would start capital actions in the amount of share repurchases once we achieve a 10% CET1 ratio. That's still the plan. Right now, we want to make sure that we get through all of the conversions and conversions are going to take probably 1 to 2 years. We want to make sure our earnings get to the really high levels that we can achieve that we have out there projected. And at that point, then we'll revisit the leverage and capital of the company. But the combination of these two companies should be leading industry capital generation at the end of the day, which will help bolster our overall returns and returns back to the shareholders. Betsy Graseck : So are you suggesting that capital return will be on hold until the conversions are done? I just want to make sure I understand that? Daryl Bible : So we will basically - this is - obviously the Board has to approve this. But when we approve the transaction, both boards said that we wanted to get our capital ratios, CET1 to 10 and then at that point, we would do share repurchases. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Kelly King : And Betsy, remember that it's a multifaceted set of variables that we have to consider and the Board has to consider. The progress with regard to the merger, the combinations in terms of systems, et cetera, but we also have to pay attention to what's going on in the economy and in global geopolitical issues and all of that. And so for all of those reasons, we are being admittedly conservative when we say 10%. And there certainly is some upside opportunity with regard to capital utilization as we go forward. But as you know, we are conservative and we're going to be careful as we go through this because there's so much earnings power in this organization as we go forward. We will be able to provide extremely good returns, in my view, for our shareholders, but it's important not to rush it in terms of overleveraging the company in the beginning. Betsy Graseck : Got it\u2026 Daryl Bible : I mean even at a 10% CET1 ratio, we will have leading industry return on tangible equity. Kelly King : We're targeting 22%, Betsy. Will that be satisfactory? Betsy Graseck : 22? 22.5 - do I hear 22.5? No, that's helpful. Okay. And so it really doesn't matter if the NPR goes through or not, your 10% is your 10%? Kelly King : Yes. Daryl Bible : Yes. Betsy Graseck : Okay. All right. And then just separate question on the net cost saves that you've talked about. I know that's on a net basis. Are you thinking about disclosing what your expectations are for the growth investment to get those net cost saves at some point? When do you think you'll be communicating that to The Street? Kelly King : Betsy, we still are putting together the plans as you would expect and trying to figure out what the net savings will be, what will be the investments in terms of innovation and technology. So we gave you a good broad number. We will be refining that as we go forward, but it's a bit early, to be honest to knowing exactly what the branch savings costs will be, exactly what the investments and innovation will be. But make no mistake, we're confident with at least $1.6 billion and we're confident that that allows us to make the kind of investments we talked about in terms of leaning forward with regard to innovation and technology investments because that's really the juice in this thing, Betsy. I mean it's the cost side of play we get that, but that's not what we're really focused on. We're focused on positioning ourselves to be a leader in terms of innovation and technology so that we can compete effectively with the largest institutions in the country. And we believe there's enough economics in this to allow us to make those kinds of investments from a long-term point of view and still generate robust returns to our shareholders. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay. So TBD and you'll let us know when you're there? So that - I'd appreciate that. Okay. Thank you. Kelly King : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi. Since the merger, BB&T stock has performed only in line with the bank index and has underperformed the S&P 500. It seems that one issue is cultural risk. Kelly, you just said that the cultures are similar, but they certainly are not the same. So the question is what are the cultural differences? And how do you bridge the gap? And I'd highlight three areas. One would be the structure. It seems that BB&T runs relatively more by hierarchy than SunTrust. So how do you get team A plus team B to create a new team C? Two would be engagement of employees. You've mentioned retention packages, but we all know that people can quit without leaving. In other words, how do you get their hearts into the job? And three would be the CEO risk. Again, it's that you and Bill are all smiles, you love each other, everything is great. But how will you handle it during times when you don't agree? I mean my wife and I got married and it was all great and then we have disagreements like your socks are on the floor. So will you be able to confront that? I was not the only -- all is good with my wife and I. But you're going to have times that you disagree, and I think that seems to be important to how you're going to get along during those times than during this kind of engagement or honeymoon period? Kelly King : Well, thanks, Mike. I mean I think that is kind of at the heart and soul of the issue, I would say, but I feel really good on all those, but let me be direct. With regard to your positioning that BB&T is more hierarchical, I would disagree with that. When you really look at these two organizations and now we've lived very closely together for 8 weeks, and I know that's not like 25 years, but it's been a pretty involved eight weeks. And Bill and I have known each other for a long time. I really think when you get into it, Mike, there's not any substantial difference there. We're both very focused on empowering our associates and leading from principal, leading from purpose, leading from mission. And so when you really get into it, I have not been able to find any kind of difference in terms of hierarchy or any other words that you might chose to use with regard to that. In terms of our associates, which is the most important, we feel really good about that. We've had very little - very, very little loss of associates at this point. And yes, we are using retention programs, et cetera. But much more importantly, Bill and I agreed day 1 that we're not taking anything for granted and we're not expecting our associates to just line up and be good soldiers. We take the responsibility and all of our team does to re-recruit every day. And so we are recruiting our associates to remain a part of this team for the purpose of being a part of something that's very exciting, very dynamic. It's an organization that has and can continue at an enhanced basis be a really good place to work. I mean, it can be a place where you can find your why, for your purpose in life and align it with an organization that is deeply committed to purpose and why and making a difference in the world and lighting the way to financial well being. I mean all of that and these two organizations is extremely consistent. And I think this could be kind of hard to find somewhere that's any better and not - hard to find many places that are as good in terms of just pure opportunity. I told some people, I wish I was 40 years old again. I mean this is just so exciting in terms of thinking about where this organization could go, but not just economically, I'm talking more importantly in terms of the contribution we can make to the world. I mean we can truly help our clients achieve economic success and financial security. We could really -- we have a fantastic associate benefit value program and we can enhance it. We're working really hard with our communities to even enhance an already outstanding community involvement program. And so there is no meaningful difference in terms of how we do business. Our associates get that and I don't expect to see any substantial reasons to leave whether you're talking about technical or not or mostly about having their heart and soul into the game. When I'm talking to our associates, I mean I'm getting feedback from the SunTrust associates and Bill tells me the same thing, they're genuinely excited about this. They recognize we're putting together two great companies that can forge an opportunity for all of us to have a lot of fun, make the world a better place to be and do some good stuff. Get up in the morning, excited about coming to work. That's what we're trying to do. The CEO risk. I know everybody talks, Mike, a lot about that, but Bill and I get along great. We've known each other a long time. We're both, as I say, North Carolina boys, although he's been, basically, all of his career in Atlanta. But look, I have spent a lot of time in Atlanta too and there's no material difference between Georgia and North Carolina. We're all from kind of the base root cultures and we get along great. We're both kind of really, really purpose-driven individuals. We're both achievement-driven individuals. We're both deeply committed to our communities and our associates. And while you might find slight differences in terms of our personalities, I really think we are an awful lot alike. I know we've got to work on our fist pumping. We've been practicing that. But other than that, there's no material difference between Bill and I and we're working together great. Mike Mayo : So just one follow-up. Where do you think the stock market has it wrong? You've gotten zero credit in the stock market for your merger despite the synergies based on the inline performance with the bank index. Almost every investor that I speak with brings up the cultural risk, the differences in culture. Where do you think the stock market has it wrong when they're evaluating this aspect of the merger? Kelly King : So Mike, as you know, I've been through 1 large MOE, although it was 20 plus years ago, but these two are very similar. And I'm seeing the same thing here that we saw then. The stock market doesn't have it wrong. The stock market just kind of says prove it.  And I don't blame them for that. I think the smarter ones will take a bit of a - more of a leap of faith and trust the experience that Bill and I have had over all these years. I mean I've been at it 47 years. He has been at it like 39 years. We're not like just starting out. So I think the smart investors will recognize it, but they'll find a high probability to a successful venture and they'll invest early. Those that are more conservative will lay back and wait for us to prove it. It kind of does not matter to me. I'm not interested in short-run results. I'm not interested in short-term pops into stock. My commitment and Bill's commitment to the long term for our shareholders is to produce a good, steady, less volatile long-term growing TSR and that's exactly what we're going to do. Mike Mayo : And then last quick follow-up. Is - are the SunTrust executives going to go through the BB&T Leadership Institute? Or -- we enjoyed that Investor Day that you had for us there, but how will that play a part in the new firm? Kelly King : Yeah. I was glad you were there, Mike. And we were actually there last week. You may appreciate, we spent 1.5 days over there last week with our new executive team. We have - we'll have multiple leadership team-building sessions going forward. And all of the SunTrust executives have committed to go through and excitedly committed to go through. They loved it and frankly - and they feel really good, but yes, they are definitely going to be going through that and we'll be doing things together. So the Leadership Institute is a powerful organization in terms of helping people grow individually and as teams. And so far, I would say, there's a 150% commitment to working together in those types of endeavors. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Kelly King : You bet. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Kelly King : Morning. Erika Najarian : Morning. You've been pretty explicit about the purchase accounting adjustments on the loan side, but Daryl, I'm wondering if you could give us a better sense on the mark-to-market accounting that we could expect on the pro forma balance sheet on the securities and on wholesale funding? And also, is there any flexibility to optimize the yields and the costs? Daryl Bible : That's a great question, Erika. Being a former treasurer, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. When the two companies come together, we're basically going to have half the balance sheet mark-to-market. So as that gets closer, our treasurer and executive management will decide if we need to adjust the interest rate risk profile or if we need to change some of the asset classes or mix of what we have. Everything - half the balance sheet will be available to basically buy or sell it in that time or change positions. So I would view that as a huge opportunity for us and position us for the future. So I think as the time gets closer to when we know we're going to close, we'll be able to give you more color on that. But I think this is just an unbelievable opportunity for somebody to really position the company forward from that perspective. Erika Najarian : Got it. And in your S-4, you noted that the $3.5 billion fair value adjustment, $3 billion of it was for credit and the rest 500 - about $500 million was for interest rates and other mark-to-market adjustments. I'm wondering if you close the deal in 2019 if SunTrust's loan portfolio does better than it -- or runs better than the 2% loss rate, could you continue to reclassify that $3 billion or the PCI or non-accretable yield to non-PCI or accretable yield? And does CECL change any of this even if you close in 2019? Daryl Bible : So when we came up with the credit mark on the SunTrust portfolio, it was 2%. And Clark and I still agree that's the appropriate number as we get in and look more at it. We did hire a third party to help us with the evaluation methods for the whole balance sheet and that is going on. And that - it's not completed yet, that will probably be completed in the next couple of months. But from the closing of the transaction in '19, we'll have the typical PCI amount of loans and then with the rest, we'll have a fair value mark. When we adopt CECL in 2020, the PCI loans and some of the other loans will be reclassified into PCD. And then, we will allocate a life of loss, the CECL reserve to the remaining SunTrust and BB&T loans at that point in time. So in essence, if you look at just the SunTrust loans from a good book perspective, you'll have a discount amount on there that will creep through income plus you'll have a life of loss reserve with CECL. So from that perspective, I would say, the loan portfolio will be more than adequately covered. It's kind of really odd accounting. We have a comment letter into FASB. And I think some other banks that have done deals recently have comment letters into FASB, but that's the way we understand the accounting now is how it's going to play out. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. Daryl, back at Investor Day, you talked about running down the securities book and using that to fund loans. You got the securities relatively flat on an average basis versus last quarter. And I understand that you can kind of reposition this when the deal closes, but what's your thought process between now and then in terms of the securities book? Daryl Bible : Yeah. I'd really like to get clarity on the NPR and tailoring, Matt. I mean, assuming that we stay at 70% LCR or go to 85%, that's really going to dictate how much securities we need. We have the advantage that both of us have capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank. So we can do letters of credit there and we can also pledge the public funds to kind of optimize the balance sheet from that perspective. But I wouldn't anticipate us changing our investment portfolio right now until we get approval from the proposed NPR that's out there, right? Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then just circling back on some of the discussion about the cost saves and the investments, get us more information down the road. Do you guys have an estimate on when we might get more details on what's driving the cost saves beyond just a couple of the bullet points and the numbers behind it, just to have a sense of when you'll have that information for us? Daryl Bible : I would say, we will continue to work on that. As we put the two companies together, we have financials, we get more clarity. We are in the midst of selecting the layers of management from executive management on down. That will create some cost savings from that perspective just because you've got duplications in a lot of business managers from that perspective. So that will kind of start where some of the savings are, but it's going to really evolve over time. We really aren't looking at and can't really look at any vendor information until we close the transaction due to antitrust. So that's just out there at a very high level. And as the branch systems come together and we'll have some branch closures, we'll have more color on what those savings relate to. Shared services, there's a lot of overlap on shared services as business models are selected and locations are selected and that's going to impact closures on those areas and facilities. So I think there is a wealth of areas that we'll be able to piece together to achieve a net $1.6 billion number that will leave enough for technology and other investments in the company. So we think we can have industry-leading profitability returns as well as still increase the ramp-up of our technology investments in the company. Matt O'Connor: Okay, all right. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Morning. Kelly King : Morning. John Pancari : On the stand-alone side, on the loan growth, wanted to see if you can give a little bit of -- more color around your outlook? What gives you the confidence in the 4% to 6% linked-quarter annualized trend that you can see in the second quarter? Where are you seeing the greatest strengths and acceleration in production? Thanks. Clarke Starnes : Hey, John, this is Clarke Starnes. You have to remember we do have a defined seasonality in the first quarter. So you saw that particularly in our indirect businesses, such as our Sheffield portfolio, our premium finance, our Mortgage Warehouse Lending. The projection right now is you'll see that bounce back nicely in the second quarter. We anticipate we're going to have good mortgage lending growth and then also very strong overall C&I. So those would really be the drivers. And based on those dynamics around seasonality and what we see in the pipeline and there we are going to book, we have a lot of confidence we will get the number. Daryl Bible : I think we're forecasting every category to be up one quarter but CRE. So it will be across-the-board contribution like. John Pancari : Got it. Okay, thanks. And then separately on the combined basis, I know you had indicated that there are more broadly no big change in the earnings power expectation per John's question, but also want to see if - can you talk specifically about your 51% combined efficiency ratio expectation as well as the 22% return on tangible common equity expectation. Any change to those given the backdrop, the rate environment, et cetera? Kelly King : No, John, we don't see any changes. Based on everything we see now, those numbers were derived very mathematically based off of reasonably conservative assumptions and nothing we see today or looking forward change the fundamentals of those assumptions. John Pancari : Got it, okay. Thanks, Kelly. Operator : And we'll take our final question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning. One more merger-related question. Daryl, as we think ahead to the closing quarter, one of the toughest things is always to kind of range the - what then ending up NIM looks like. And granted that there will be some differences as you already mentioned about the - where the purchase accounting ends up, do you have - is it - do you have a general understanding of how we should think about like what the pro forma NIM looks like, given that your guys are at 350-ish or so and SunTrust is in the upper 320s plus any PAA or credits or stuff to help us to set that starting point? Thanks. Daryl Bible : Yeah. So we're going to be reporting both the core net interest margin and reported or GAAP net interest margin and it will probably a wide variance between the two because you're marking the market basically half the balance sheet. We'll give you more specifics as we get closer. But our core margins overall should be pretty much simply just putting our two margins together today. So 330 plus or minus would probably be a good ballpark number. But as far as reported GAAP margin, there is a lot of puts and takes in there. And we'll give you a lot of color and a lot of tables and basically disclose how all that's going to play out because it will be complex as we put the two together. And we'll just have to be very transparent with you and show you how it's going to work and just how it's going to run off over time from that perspective. As I said earlier though, on an earlier question, we will have the opportunity to basically reposition the balance sheet if we want to do that at some point, that could potentially help and drive core margin at that point, but it's too early to know that right now. Ken Usdin : Okay. Understood. And then back to the - a core question. Kelly had mentioned the ongoing migration out of non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing trend we're seeing at a lot of banks. Now that the rate cycle presumably has stopped, how do you - I know you've said that you expect that mix to continue, but what are you seeing and hearing in terms of the ongoing pressures on interest-bearing deposit costs and the push and pull between growing deposits versus having to pay up for them? Thanks, guys. Kelly King : So I think, Ken, that having watched these things over a number of cycles, you get these spurts where everybody kind of -- are kind of price insensitive for a while and then they look at it and they become price sensitive and there's a spurt of time, 60, 90 days, where they are much more sensitive, and then they kind of go back to running their business again and they are not as sensitive, so you kind of go ebb and flow. What I think is that we just saw, over the last 90 days or so, a spurt up in sensitivity. But with rates stable to back down kind of now, I think it's probably going to move into -- you won't go back down in terms of sensitivities, but you won't see a rise up in sensitivities if that make sense. So I think you will see less focus on betas and moving money around over the next period of time than you've seen over the last 90 to 120 days. Now if there's a dramatic shift in rates one way or the other, that will change that, but nobody expects that. I certainly don't expect that. So I think you're getting ready to go into a period of less price-sensitivity focus in terms of moving money around. Ken Usdin : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And that does conclude our Q&A session today. I would now like to hand things back over to Rich Baytosh for any additional or closing remarks. Richard Baytosh : Okay. Thank you, Leanne, and thanks everyone for joining us today. I hope you have a great day. Thank you. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.+",

Please also note that our presentation includes certain non-GAAP disclosures. Please refer to Page 2 and the appendix of our presentation for the appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kelly. Kelly King : Thank you, Rich. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call. We are really pleased. We had overall a very strong quarter, strong results with record earnings, was really driven by strong loan growth, improved revenues, especially in insurance, but also very strong investment banking revenue and very solid mortgage rebound. Excellent asset quality once again. Clarke will give you detail on that. And we\u2019re making excellent progress with regard to our MOE with SunTrust. So, if you\u2019re on Slide 4, net income was a record $842 million, which was up 8.6% versus second quarter of 2018. Now, that is \u2013 if you look at net income excluding merger and restructuring charges, and this quarter we\u2019re also calling out incremental operating expenses related to the merger. It was a record $868 million, up 9.7% versus second quarter. Diluted EPS was a record $1.09, up 10.1% versus second quarter of 2018. Adjusted EPS was a record $1.12, up 10.9% versus second quarter of 2018. Our adjusted ROA and ROCE and ROTCE were very strong at respectively 1.59%, 12.34% and 20%. Our record revenue was $3.1 billion, up 19.8% annualized from the first quarter and up 5.7% versus the second quarter. So, we really have overall strong fee income that really helped offset the negative effects on the curve flattening. We had \u2013 fee income was a record $1.4 billion, up $150 million from the first quarter. Really strong revenue performance in every regard in insurance. Chris will give some real detail on that. Investment banking and brokerage also had strong quarters, up 20% like quarter and annualized 72% linked quarter. And interestingly, every fee category grew during the quarter. Now, NIM did decrease 9 basis points to 3.42% and core NIM decreased 10 basis points to 3.34%. There is a lot going on with regard to the yield curve, as you all know. Daryl is going to give you a lot of detail on that in just a bit. Our expense management continues to be very strong. As you know, we\u2019ve been focusing hard on that for the last several years. So, our adjusted efficiency ratio came down to 55.1%, which has been kind of a long-term target for us. That\u2019s a result of excellent performance coming out of our disrupt-to-thrive strategy, which was the last three years of focus on expenses. Adjusted expenses were $1.72 billion, up versus last quarter and like quarter, that was due primarily due to incentives based on related strong fee performance and somewhat offset by lower payroll taxes. Credit was just great. NPA ratio was 0.23%, a decrease of 3 basis points. We think it\u2019s the lowest we can remember or we could find in the records also, it\u2019s really good. Charge offs were 38 basis points versus 40 basis points in the first quarter and 30 basis points in the like quarter. We continue to have a great progress in combining BB&T and SunTrust in a merger of equals to create Truist, the premier financial institution. I\u2019ll talk more about that in a little bit. But we did announce our new headquarters building in Charlotte, which is one of the tallest buildings in Charlotte. If you\u2019re familiar with Charlotte, it\u2019s the old Hearst building. We did just this week announced a $60 billion community benefits agreement, which we were excited about in terms of working with our communities, because one of the most important reasons we\u2019re doing this merger is to be more of a leader in making the world a better place to be and light the way to financial wellbeing. And we\u2019re very excited about that. We\u2019re making really good progress in terms of laying out the management structure. And so, we had two rounds of higher level management announcements. So, we already announced about 900 positions and the next layer will be out by the end of August and by the end of August, we will have announced about 75% of the management layers, which gets us way down, way, way down into the organization. We do have a special shareholder vote set by July 30 by BB&T and SunTrust. And so, we\u2019re very, very excited about that. I\u2019ll give you a little bit of more color on the MOE in just a bit. We are selling $4 billion worth of residential mortgages to respond to the changes in the interest rate environment which Daryl will give you detail on. If you look at Slide 5, we did have two categories of selected items to call out to you. Our regular merger-related and restructuring charges was $23 million pre-tax, $19 after-tax, or about $0.02 diluted EPS impact. And again, we\u2019re calling out what we\u2019re going to just refer to you for the next few quarters, incremental operating expenses related to the merger which was $9 million, which was another $0.01. These are expenses that don\u2019t meet our definition of merger related charges, because they do provide future benefits, but they will not be a part of our expense run rate. We simply want to be very transparent with regard to this, because we want you to be able to have good information to consider as you determine our run rate as we go forward. If you look at Slide 6, it is a really good loan growth quarter. The aggregate loan growth was 6.5%, which is very strong given the market environment we\u2019re in. C&I, we\u2019re really pleased about, which was 7.8%. CRE, pardon me, was down 3%, but that was frankly by design. We\u2019ve talked to you about the fact that there is a lot of really stretched underwriting going on out in the marketplace, particularly in the CRE space. We choose not to participate in that, so we\u2019re actually very pleased with that metric. Auto portfolio, we are really excited about we\u2019ve been talking to you about that optimizing portfolio. It is now turned the corner as we projected and it did grow small amount 0.5%, but it did grow, and that\u2019s larger due to some product changes we\u2019ve made in the branches particularly our auto branches \u2013 on an auto loans we\u2019re making in the branches, so overall really strong loan growth. We feel really good about it, there\u2019s a lot of talk about what\u2019s going on in the economy. I can just tell you what we see. The market is pretty good, activity is very good, when we talk to clients, talk to him directly, I\u2019ll get direct feedback from our people in our commercial and community bank, there\u2019s no sign of any kind of imminent slowdown. Not necessarily that the overall talk about tariffs and trade wars and all of that won\u2019t eventually have some impact we keep talking about it enough. But for now, most people are pretty resilient that businesses good and underlying activities slowing through and getting to kind of loan growth that I just reported. So, we actually feel pretty good about the economy and believe it has legs to continue as we go forward. If you\u2019re following along on Page 7, we were very pleased with our overall deposit performance given the environment that we\u2019re operating in. So, of our total deposits were down slightly 0.4% [ph], but very encouragingly our noninterest-bearing deposits, or DDA was up 3%. Our client deposits, which excludes national market funding sources increased 2.6%, which is very strong. Our percentage of noninterest-bearing deposits was 32.9% compared to 32.7% in the first quarter, so that\u2019s encouraging. The cost of interest-bearing deposits was 1.02%, up 7 basis points, but that was slower increase from last year. And the cost of total deposits was 0.68%, which was up 4 basis points. So, it is a very challenging time with the ratios and the deposit disintermediation that is going on, and Daryl\u2019s going to provide you with some really good color on that area, because we know you\u2019re focused on entities of our report. Daryl. Daryl Bible : Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I\u2019m going to talk about excellent credit quality, margin and fee income dynamics, improved efficiency, and provide guidance for third quarter and full year 2019. Turning to Slide 8. Credit quality remains strong. Net charge-offs of $142 million were down 2 basis points as a percentage of average loans. Our nonperforming asset ratio was 23 basis points that is below our previous low seen in 2006. Continuing on Slide 9, our allowance coverage ratios remained strong at 2.8 times net charge-offs and 3.46 times at nonperforming loans. We recorded a provision of credit losses of $172 million, which exceeded net charge-offs of $142 million. The $30 million allowance build was in line with loan growth, keeping our allowance to loan ratio flat at 1.05%. Turning to Slide 10. The reported net interest margin was 3.42%, down 5 basis points after adjusting for dividends on nonqualified plan assets received in the first quarter. Our core margin was 3.34% was down 6 basis points after adjusting for the first quarter nonqualified plan dividends. Net interest margin was impacted by lower rate that slowed and increased in the loan yield \u2013 loan portfolio yields. In addition, faster prepayments are residential mortgage loans increased premium amortization resulting in 2 to 3 basis points negative impact on the second quarter margin. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 8 basis points in the second quarter versus 13 basis points in the first quarter. We are still seeing mixed changes in our core deposit that are offsetting the decreased in interest rates. Note that BB&T plans to sell approximately $4 billion of residential mortgages, which were reduced our asset sensitivity and negative convexity. The proceeds for the mortgage sale will be reinvested in the high quality securities provide improved liquidity from the upcoming MOE. Continuing on Slide 11. Noninterest income was record $1.4 billion, up 10.6% versus like quarter, resulting in fee income ratio were 44.4%. Record insurance income increased $56 million reflecting solid organic growth and P&C seasonality. Regions Insurance contributed $32 million to insurance income. Excluding Regions Insurance income rose 11% from a year-ago on strong organic growth. Looking ahead, recall that insurance income is seasonally lower in the third quarter. Investment banking and brokerage fees and commissions increased $20 million on greater deal activity and increased managed fee accounts. Mortgage banking income increased $50 million and included $29 million of net MSR valuation adjustments and seasonally higher mortgage sales volumes. Service charges on deposits increased $10 million due to more days in the quarter. Other income was down $5 million mostly due to a $20 million decrease in SBIC private equity investments that was partially offset by client derivatives. Turning to Slide 12. Our efficiency ratio improved. We generated positive operating leverage on a GAAP and on an adjusted basis versus linked and like quarters. We reported $1.8 billion in operating expenses, a 1.8% increase from a year-ago and 3.9% decrease from the prior quarter. Included in the operating expenses for merger and restructuring charges of $23 million and incremental operating expenses related to the merger of $9 million, which will have a recurring benefit to the company. Incremental operating expenses related to the merger include items, such as retention bonus payments, professional services related to the design and planning of Truist. Excluding the merger restructuring charges and the incremental operating expenses related to the merger, our adjusted noninterest expense increased 1.4% from a year-ago to $1.7 billion. Of note, personnel expense increased $33 million due to a $43 million increase in incentive-related compensation partially offset by a $14 million decrease in payroll taxes. There were 563 fewer FTEs versus the first quarter. Continuing on Slide 13. Capital and liquidity remain strong. Our CE Tier 1 ratio was 10.3% flat with last quarter. Our dividend and total payout ratios were 36.8%. Our modified average LCR ratio was 129%. In addition, our board will consider increasing our quarterly dividend by 11% to $0.45 per share at the July meeting. Now let\u2019s turn the Slide 14 to review our segments. Community Banking Retail and Consumer Finance net income increased $66 million to $445 million. The increase was driven by higher loans volume, more days in the quarter, improved deposit spreads, seasonality in the higher mortgage volume and net MSR valuation adjustments of $29 million. Improved loan production was driven by strong growth in mortgage and indirect lending. In residential mortgage originations were about 70% up from last quarter. The production mix was 68% purchase and 32% refi. And again, on fair margin was 1.65% versus 1.60% last quarter. Continuing on Slide 15. Community Banking Commercial net income was $319 million, a $9 million decrease was due to a $20 million increase in provision, partially offset by $8 million in net interest income and $5 million increase in noninterest income. Loan production increased 15.4% mostly due to seasonality. Turning to Slide 16. Financial Services and Commercial Finance net income was $169 million. The $13 million increase reflected $45 million increase in noninterest income attributable to higher deal activity, managed account fees, client derivative fees and commercial mortgage banking income. Higher revenue was partially offset by an increase noninterest expense and higher provision. Average loan balances grew 8.6% annualized aided by corporate banking and equipment finance. Turning to Slide 17. Insurance Holdings net income was $111 million, an increase of $23 million. Total revenue increased $57 million and the seasonal pickup in PNC commissions were partially offset by higher incentive-based compensation. Organic revenue was 11.6% from a year-ago quarter. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Chris to provide more perspective on Insurance Holdings performance this quarter. Christopher Henson : Thanks Daryl. The purpose of the two slides on 18 and 19 really to show the transformation plan that John Howard and his team implemented and also shared Investor Day last fall really continues to gain momentum. The plan, as a reminder, was developed with the assistance of BCG a little over a year-ago, when it\u2019s really on full swing. It\u2019s built around 31 initiatives, includes implementation and new operating models for both retail and wholesale, as well as numerous revenue growth and expense reduction initiatives. And as a result, I think, you\u2019re seeing business continued to gain significant momentum. And we\u2019re really seeing the results across all lines of business, if you look on Page 18 at the upper left hand graph, you can see revenue of 17.6% or $89 million. If you exclude the $32 million that Daryl mentioned from regions, we now have regions of full year, we still excluding regions had organic revenue improvement of $57 million. And if you look at organic growth really three drivers of organic growth and really, we\u2019re hitting on all three cylinders there. Pricing is one, and recall we are post two of insured loss years in history in 2017 and 2018. So actually, saw our pricing bump in the first quarter to sort of a flattish to up 2%, and in second quarter, we actually saw moved up plus 3.5%, which is very helpful. New business which is producing new units is far and away the largest driver of organic growth, and that\u2019s really abled by a strong economy, we see that continuing. And then, we\u2019ve got really high intention rates \u2013 retention rates, which have actually improved since first quarter, retails up to 92.1%, wholesale was 79.6%. So, what that gives you is really in the lower left hand corner, which is substantially improved organic growth. I think probably the best numbers that we\u2019ve posted in our history. And if you look at the light quarter comparison, we moved from 5.2% to \u2013 as Daryl said, up to 11.6%. And I believe all the numbers rolled in for the quarter, we\u2019ll probably see the industry and probably averaging in the 5% \u2013 4% to 5% range. Economic fundamentals are still really favorable for this business, as businesses grow and add equipment and expand buildings and add people, those are all insurable items, the industry refers to the exposure units, we see that continue to grow. And then also market conditions are stable. I\u2019ll allude to pricing. You\u2019ve seen some specific markets where there have been losses begin to harden up there. For example, commercial auto is up about 6% and commercial property, which we have a disproportionate large share to, is up 3.5%, bumped up 4% this quarter. If you turn to Page 8 \u2013 19, excuse me. Again another major focus is on margin improvement, if you look at the upper left chart you\u2019ll see our adjusted EBITDA, adjusted meaning we pullout merger related charges, you can see for like quarter, up from $120 million to $171 million, so up $51 million was due very much on track was regions now that we\u2019ve had for full 12 months to achieve our target expense in revenue synergies throughout \u2013 by the end of 2019. Organic growth and strong expense control, however, really the drivers of improved margin. As it relates to organic growth, as I said a moment ago, the primary is new business growth and that\u2019s really hinging on the economy, and we\u2019re up 9% year-to-date later, which is substantial. And on expense control side, certainly, we\u2019ve mentioned regions, but we also have FTE savings really across all business lines and we\u2019ve got new systems implementations, which have cost implication in some cases revenue and speed to delivery, really in probably 75% to 80% of the businesses. So, if you look at the EBITDA margin in the lower left hand corner, we have this quarter posted the best margins that we have ever posted. Now this is our strongest seasonal quarter of the year, we won\u2019t maintain this, but we went from 23.7% up to 28.8%, which is we haven\u2019t seen those numbers in our history. So, we\u2019re going to continue to optimize operations looking forward and we\u2019re going to begin the shift and differentiate with the use of data and analytics really to enhance client experience and knowledge of the client. And we\u2019re doing that especially today in wholesale. So, in summary, I\u2019ll just tell you really proud the transformation we started 15-or-so months ago or 18 months ago is really begin to kick-in and work, and I see really a bright remainder of 2019 in terms of environment for this business and then expected to continue to perform strongly. So, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Daryl. Daryl Bible : Thank you, Chris. Continuing on Slide 20, you\u2019ll see our outlook. Looking at the third quarter, we expect average total loans held for investment to be down 4% to 6% annualized versus second quarter. Excluding the mortgage sale, loans are expected to be up 4% to 6% annualized. We expect net charge-offs to be in the range of 35 to 45 basis points and the provision is expected to match charge-offs plus loan growth. We also expect both GAAP and core net interest margin to be down 4 to 8 basis points versus second quarter. We have pre-invested the proceeds from the mortgage sale in the high quality security. Since the security is settled before the mortgage sale, there will be a temporary increase and earning assets during the quarter. This will negatively impact net interest margin by approximately 3 basis points in the third quarter. The sale of residential mortgages and the reinvestment into securities will not have a negative impact on the go forward net interest income. Excluding this temporary increase in earning assets, we expect the net interest margin to decline 1 to 5 basis points in the third quarter. We anticipate fee income to be up 2% to 4% versus like quarter, we expect expenses to be flat versus like quarter. Incremental operating expenses related to the merger may increase from second quarter levels, which is why we created this category. And finally, we anticipate an effective tax rate up 20% to 21%. Our previous full year guidance remains unchanged. In the challenging rate environment, we will continue to grow revenue, faster than expenses driving positive operating leverage as we move towards the MOE close with SunTrust. In summary, the quality of our earnings this quarter was excellent, resulting in record earnings, positive operating leverage versus last quarter and last year strong loan growth and excellent credit quality. Now let me turn it back to Kelly for update on the merger of equals with SunTrust, closing thoughts and Q&A. Kelly King : Thanks, Daryl. So, if you\u2019re following along on Slide 21, we just want to give you a bit of detail with regard to where we are, because obviously it\u2019s the major focus in terms of two company\u2019s going forward. First, let me just say to Bill Rogers and I are very pleased with where we are. He and I are working very, very well together. We\u2019ve known each other long time. We have a complete meeting as a whole team in terms of the industry dynamics that are going on, which led to the merger and causes us to have a consensus view in terms of where we are going forward. The new proposed executive management team is working great, we are meeting weekly as a whole team and have sense we announced the combination. Making really good progress in terms of the regulatory process, we did have the regulatory held hearings on April 24 in Charlotte, May 3 in Atlanta. I\u2019ll tell you that we\u2019ve had our 1,000 public comments and 95% plus of those are positive and very much supportive of the merger, so all of that is going very, very well. We submitted our capital plan, which is going well, and we feel very good about that. As I indicated, we\u2019ve already announced about 1,000 of our key management positions and by the end of August, we think, we\u2019ll have north of 75% of our announcements made. And that get you way down into the organization in terms of people that are be leading the new company. We did announce recently enhanced investments, as we said in beginning in terms of the Great Atlanta area and the Greater Piedmont Triad area in North Carolina. We also announced our headquarter builds. I mentioned we announced our new name, Truist. We feel very good about the name; I know some people come up with that name. But we \u2013 what we really wanted was what we were trying to accomplish in the merger. When Bill and I talk about this merger, we didn\u2019t want to be looking back, we wanted to be looking forward. We wanted to have a merger, we wanted to have a company that could look forward to help clients and prospects think about how they can meet their dreams and goals and hopes in life looking forward. And so, in that regard, we wanted a name that speaks to the assets of companies, but reflects a go-forward mentality in terms of growing with our clients, helping our communities become better places to be. And of course, doing a really good job for our shareholders and our associates, and we think Truist does that. We think as time goes on and we build the branding around that, we think we\u2019ll be an outstanding name. We feel very, very good about it. We have mailed the merger proxy statements to BB&T and SunTrust shareholders. And we will have shareholder approvals separately, but on the same day on July 30. We did announce recently the $60 billion community benefits plan, which is very, very good. On July 10, we did receive regulatory approval from North Carolina Commissioner of Banks. So that\u2019s a substantial positive for us. So, we\u2019re making great progress. Kind of looking forward, here is what you can expect. We\u2019ll continue to do a lot of work in terms of building our innovative culture together. So far, we feel really good about that. We do not see any substantial cultural issues in our companies. But there is obviously work to be done in terms of being sure that we have day to day, what I call, operating cultural processes and procedures that are synced up. And we\u2019re working on that. It\u2019s going very, very well. We\u2019ll be continuing the brand development process into fall. You will see more rollout with regard to logos, et cetera. We\u2019ll be continuing the organizational design, naming the final staffing, so that at our legal day one, we will be organized and staffed and ready to go. That\u2019s very, very important, because we can\u2019t wait till legal day one to figure out how you\u2019re going to run the company. So, we are heavily immersed into planning for the combined company. And we will in fact be ready on legal day one to run the company effectively. We do have on July 24, a hearing with the United States House Committee on Financial Services, which we expect to go well. And then, we would wait for the remaining regulatory approvals. And then we will be a position to close. I will say to you that we still feel very confident about our projected $1.6 billion of our net cost synergies, cost savings. And again, that\u2019s net of investments we make back into the business like technology and innovation and other investments. So overall, as Daryl said, it\u2019s a strong quarter, solid economy out there, great progress on MOE. Truist will be, in my view, a great company. And we absolutely believe that our best days are clearly ahead. Now, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Rich. Richard Baytosh : Thank you, Kelly. Orlando, at this time, if you would come back on the line and explain how our listeners could participate in the Q&A session. Operator : Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Good morning. Kelly King : Good morning. Daryl Bible : Morning, John. John Pancari : Sorry if I missed it. But could you tell us, what do you assume for fed cuts in your current outlooks? And then separately, if you could just give us a little bit of color of how you\u2019re thinking about the NIM beyond the third quarter color that you gave, how you view the NIM trajectory through the end of the year? Thanks. Daryl Bible : Yeah, John, this Daryl. So, in our forecast, we had one rate decrease in July of this quarter, third quarter, and then another one in the fourth quarter, in October, is what we\u2019re forecasting out. Guidance for fourth quarter, I want to \u2013 it all depends on how our deposits react and how they re-price with everything and competition. My guess is since we hit basically 3 basis points back from the third quarter margin, because of the increase in earning assets temporary from the investment, purchase, we\u2019re probably going to be flat to maybe down slightly in the fourth quarter. John Pancari : Okay. Thank you. And then, longer term, in terms of the NIM, I know you had previously indicated or talked about a core NIM in the ballpark of about 3.30% plus or minus post the deal. Just given the rate backdrop, I got to assume that may have changed. Can you give us your updated thoughts on that? Thanks. Daryl Bible : Obviously, with rates potentially going down and the flatter curve, that does put pressure on net interest margin. I would update you once we get the deal approved and closed on what core margin will be and what GAAP margin will be at that point in time. But definitely you\u2019re going to see some tighter margins if the rate scenario stays where it is. And if you see four rate cuts, potentially which we don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen, but if you see that that would put pressure on margin. But we\u2019ll have an opportunity at close to reposition the balance sheet. And we can get the balance sheet to be more neutral, to be more insulated from lower rates. But at the end of the day, as rates come down you can\u2019t lower your cost of funds below 0 right now. So, you\u2019ll be limited on the actions you can take. Kelly King : Right, John, this is Kelly. I will just say one person\u2019s opinion. I think the market is overreacting to what\u2019s going on in the world. I think the world \u2013 I mean, the market is overstating the decline in interest rates. Not to say that we won\u2019t have one or two. But the sentiment out there is that things are really collapsing, fed could be cutting rates like crazy, I think they\u2019re completely overblown. And we will see some slight decline in the economy. We will see some slight decline in rates. But what you\u2019re seeing now and is being projected going forward in my mind is overstated. John Pancari : Got it. All right, thank you. If I could just do one more follow up, on the insurance front you had a really good quarter in the insurance revenue, and I know Chris gave some good color there. What is the outlook? What type of growth rate do you think is sustainable longer term as you focus on the improvements in the profitability of the business? Christopher Henson : Yeah, John, I appreciate the question. In the near-term, remember, second quarter is our strongest quarter. Third quarter is our weakest seasonal quarter of the year. So, what you can expect in the near-term is probably down in the 15%, 16% range in the third quarter. But if you look out for the balance of this year, from everything I can read, the industry is really projecting something in the 4% to 5% range. We\u2019re currently probably more in the 5.5% to 6.5% kind of range is our sense. And our current year to date organic growth is at 9.3%. And again, industry expectations is probably in the 4% to 5%. What has happened is, post these \u2013 the two largest insured loss years in our history, we\u2019re actually seeing rate begin to bounce. And to Kelly\u2019s point, as long as the economy holds, that\u2019s going to really drive new business growth, which is the largest driver of our situation. We\u2019re going to do a good job in client retention. So, I really think we\u2019re in that kind of 5.5%, 6%, 6.5% range for the year, which is for us will be the best numbers we\u2019ve ever posted in organic growth and I think well ahead of the industry. We\u2019re just very, very pleased with the momentum and the transformations taking place in our business. We couldn\u2019t be more happy. John Pancari : Got it. All right, thanks, Chris. Christopher Henson : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Next up, we\u2019ll hear from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. John McDonald : Good morning. Daryl, just want to follow up on John Pancari\u2019s question regarding the NII dynamics. What kind of outlook do you have for net interest income in the back half of the year? And then, if we wanted to isolate the impact of 125 basis points fed cut, what would that be? Daryl Bible : So, in the third quarter we only have one rate cut in there, right. Our NII will probably be down slightly on a linked quarter basis. So, we were $1.690 billion this quarter. We\u2019ll probably be a little bit lower than that, maybe $5 million to $10 million, just because of the \u2013 what\u2019s the pressure that we\u2019re seeing in our funding side. As you go out into the next fourth quarter, I would say that our net interest income will be relatively flat to down a little bit. It all depends on if we get another rate cut in fourth quarter or not and what happens to the shape of the curve. We do anticipate another cut there, which would put more pressure on margin. But we think overall it will be relatively holding there pretty well. John McDonald : And then, any changes in your rate sensitivity? The mortgage sale will impact that. But \u2013 and maybe is there a way to just quantify what one cut would do if we wanted to isolate that? Daryl Bible : So, if you look on the chart on our Page 10 and the table, and if you see the Down 25 and if you look at the number for 6/30, it\u2019s 0.87%. That basically assumes over a year. It\u2019s a $60 million hit to NII. Now, it\u2019s not evenly distributed over the fourth quarter. I would say, it\u2019s a little bit, so maybe call it about $20 million for first quarter, and then it kind of moderates over the second, third, and fourth quarter. We are trying to keep our position to be less assets sensitive and we are moving in that direction with some of the actions that we are taking and we\u2019re trying to minimize that as much as possible. But we don\u2019t anticipate having that\u2019s four moves down that in the forward curve right now, but we have to also protect, which direction could risk managers in that perspective. Kelly King : And John, keep in mind that, right now is hard to see, as Daryl talked about this disintermediation shift in deposits. But there is a tipping point concept with regard to interest rates in the way clients respond. So, if rates went up over the last several quarter, we had a tipping point and people got more rates. And so, all of a sudden, they had extra money and they\u2019re checking accounts and they said, well, how put it to that. The same thing happens when the rates go down. So, as rates go down all of a sudden, the amount of interest that you give by shifting it becomes less attractive to you, if we see the continued decline in rates, there will be less sensitivity and we\u2019ll see less so that shift in disintermediation. John McDonald : Got it. And maybe just a broader picture, when we think about the longer-term projections for Truist, obviously, it\u2019s early days. But any changes in terms of the financial goals and a longer-term efficiency of 51%? And how you think about right in the company at 10% capital, Kelly, at least in the early days? Just any broad strokes of how things are changed since the original announcement on the longer-term financial projections? Kelly King : John, interestingly not much as talked about we still feel good about the 51% efficiency, and obviously that\u2019s the ratio and so revenue change that has some impact, but what we can feel very confident about is the expense reduction. That\u2019s why I highlighted, we\u2019re very confident, we\u2019ll get the $1.6 billion of net, obviously, depending on what happens move that around a little bit, but not materially, so we still feel really good about that. We think, we will be best-in-class in terms of efficiency. In terms of our tangible common equity into 22%, we already 20% are very, very confident about that. In terms of the synergies, we did remember in that model, we didn\u2019t even build in and the revenue synergies in this, but more we talk about, and more we get more about each other and how complementary and synergistic our businesses are. We didn\u2019t want to project, we\u2019re very conservative, but there will be clear revenue synergies out of this. And so, this is going to be a really high-performance company. Daryl Bible : The other point I would add to that, John, is that with rates falling, we really don\u2019t know what our capital levels would be at close. But with rates coming down where they are, our capital ratio might actually close of north of 10%, which means assuming the fact gives us a non-objection to our capital loss, which we should hear shortly about that. We could actually be in the buyback business sooner rather than later. Kelly King : So right to think about that John, is that the \u2013 we said, we concerned with regard to capital and particularly going through a major combination like this, and there are uncertainties in the global market, that are actual service et cetera. That\u2019s what we said, we won\u2019t to hang around the 10% common equity Tier 1 level. There is certainly some opportunity down the road with regard to that being lower. But for now, we want to plan on that. But as Daryl said, I mean, what we think to now may look like we could be pretty immediately and buying back and staying at 10%, so that can be \u2013 again, we\u2019re not promising, but can be very encouraging. John McDonald : Got it. Great. Thank you. Operator : And next, we\u2019ll talk a question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi, could you elaborate a little bit more on the management announcements relation to the merger. So, at the end of August, you\u2019ll have named 75% of the managers. How many in total was that, and what are you concerned about in making these announcements? What are you trying not to do and how is the cultural integration going? Kelly King : So, Mike, the managers is kind of a cost-cutting process kind of going down from the direct reports to executive, and then layer by layer by layer. So, by the time, you get to the end of August, will be down to the lowest level of operating managers think down to branch managers that kind of thing, and so all of that is going really, really well. And in that process, of course, what we\u2019re trying to do is number one make sure, we\u2019re picking the best players. One of the beauties that you know about MOE, you get to pick the best systems, processes and frankly the best people. So, we\u2019ve got an eye on the best performers, because that\u2019s fair, that\u2019s just. At the same time, we got a strong eye on equality in terms of being an MOE, and on diversity and inclusion, and so all of those factors go into these organizational decisions. But so far, I would say that we feel really good about the team that is people on the field, the mix in terms of diversity, the mix in terms of SunTrust, BB&T, it\u2019s going extremely well. In terms of the cultural process, we obviously are learning more about each others\u2019 cultures, as we meet more much as the executive team, but there are lots and lots of meetings going on down through the organization. All keep in mind planning for the future, we have been very careful. We can\u2019t make decisions about the future from a regulatory perspective. We\u2019re still two competing companies, but we can plan. And there is a whole lot of planning meeting going on, so there\u2019s a lot of interaction. And the feedback that Bill and I both get from our teammates and associates is going really well. They\u2019re just not any fundamental differences here. I\u2019ll take a lot of comfort in the fact that when we get a feedback from our employees with regard to the name, I think, we reported to you, we\u2019ve got 10,000 responses in both sides identifying names that characterize or words that characterize our companies and all 10,000 on each side picked the exact same four words. Bill Rogers and I sat through two eight hour days of listening to community groups to talk about our two companies. And as I said, over 95% of the comments were extremely positive, and a very few, what I call, really negative. But what I found interesting is when I sat there, I kind of in my mind tried to blank out BB&T or SunTrust and just listen to the comments. You would have thoughts these were community groups talking about the \u2013 for the same company. So, they are not any substantial differences in the culture about this company, and it is being formed and sort of this work to be done in terms of what I call it operating processes and procedures there are some differences there, for sure. But that\u2019s not as important as most important, what I call, which is purpose, mission and guidance. So, we feel \u2013 Bill and I both feel and our entire team feels really, really good about where we are in culture. But we\u2019re not taking anything for granted. We\u2019re working really hard to make sure, but all of our teammates and associates feel good about this. They feel really engaged, they feel sense of belonging to the organization, they are needed, they are appreciated, and they\u2019re going to be a part of fantastic company that world will come to respect as, Truist, one of the best financial companies in the world. Mike Mayo : Just one follow-up, a potential roadblock could be the hearing next week. I don\u2019t recall hearing like this every before banking simply a standalone here, I know, Citigroup that was for discussion way back when, but that was in conjunction with the change in the loss. So just \u2013 you might be first timer here for hearing like this. What message will you be trying to send? And why are they having this hearing when the Federal Reserve has such a comprehensive process? Kelly King : You\u2019re asking me that question. I\u2019ll give you my best shot on that Mike. So, I think number one, it\u2019s the first big merger since the recession. It\u2019s the fourth largest bank merger based on what I\u2019ve been told in history. So, it\u2019s a big deal. It\u2019s not big in terms of whole scheme of things. We keep saying that provided with \u2013 even though we\u2019ll be $440 billion, we\u2019ll still be about 20% of the size of largest banks. We\u2019ll still have less 3% of total management deposit. So, we\u2019re not a megabank, which is the heading of the hearing. So, they\u2019re concerned that they would think a megabank, and we\u2019re creating another two big to fail. We will be saying, we\u2019re not a megabank, very large regional bank. We focused on meeting our clients\u2019 needs. We will not be increasing systemic risk. In fact, we\u2019ll be reducing systemic risk. So, we\u2019ll share that with them. They\u2019re concerned about will we close a bunch of branches and fire a lot of people. We\u2019ll satisfy them that while there will be over time branch consolidations, we\u2019ve already committed that our performance client-facing associates will not lose their job on either side. So, we will be able to satisfy them. That is nothing negative about this. In fact, it\u2019s net overall really, really good for the economy. It\u2019s good for the communities. It\u2019s good for our associates and it\u2019s good for the shareholders. I view things they view this as an opportunity to talk about the industry. And I think it will be a positive. I kind of view it as four, five hours of free advertising. Mike Mayo : All right, thank you. Operator : Next up, we\u2019ll take a question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Daryl Bible : Good morning. Kelly King : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : Kelly, I wanted to understand a little bit more about the timing of the merger, especially as it relates to the tailoring proposal that\u2019s out there. And so, the question really is does it matter to you if the tailoring proposal is not yet finalized, before your merger is ready to close? Kelly King : So, this is the \u2013 the timing as you know is out of our control, but I personally think that we will close this transaction late 3rd or early 4th. I don\u2019t know of anything that would cause the field differently. Although, I would say again, I cannot control that. The tailoring issue, this is one of the issues that will come up in the hearing, has nothing to do with this. This not really came up when Bill and I were talking about this the multiple times that we talk. There are some financial implications in terms of capital if tailoring does not occur. But it wouldn\u2019t change our view in one form of fashion. If BB&T remain independent, we would have boasted right past 250, independent of tailoring or not. It\u2019s the number out there. But it\u2019s not nearly sufficient because you\u2019re not trying to grow to gain the economies of scale to be able to compete. And this is extremely competitive world we\u2019re living. So, people are blowing that thing out of proposition. Just like \u2013 it\u2019s the tail, it\u2019s not the dog. Betsy Graseck : I mean, I get that. Daryl Bible : Yeah, I mean, if you look at the \u2013 I mean, the capital impact is only 60 basis points, that\u2019s it, because you\u2019re marking to market, the SunTrust balance sheet, so it\u2019s not a huge capital impact. Betsy Graseck : Right, so. My question wasn\u2019t if it doesn\u2019t happen would you still do the deal with more about just the timing question here. If you\u2019re ready to close and the tailoring rules not yet finalized, you have, say, Daryl, your point of capital level that shows up a little bit lower for a quarter or two. And then, once tailoring process goes through that gets factored. So, I\u2019m wondering if you would wait until tailoring went through or not. I guess the answer is no. Kelly King : Absolutely not. We will close this merger at the minute we are approved independent of tailoring. Daryl Bible : Yeah, if you look at LCR, I mean, we could close \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s depending on how tailoring comes in. If it\u2019s just 70%, we can close and really not have to change our balance sheet much at all. If it goes to 85%, we might have to add 2% or 3% more earning assets into high quality liquid assets. But that\u2019s not material. So, we could easily do it with or without the tailoring impact. I mean, even if we didn\u2019t have tailoring, we would rather than 2% or 3% we just add 5% of earning assets of high quality. Betsy Graseck : Yeah, okay, so not a big deal for you. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then, Kelly, just separately, we hear from other folks about how there is \u2013 your merger is going to be an opportunity for them to pick up share either of strong folks in the organization or of clients. And just wanted to hear from you how you are working to ensure that you\u2019re not losing market share during this time when you got the transition going on. Kelly King : Yeah, Betsy, that\u2019s a really good question. I\u2019ve been involved in about 100 acquisitions over my career. And everyone, every local competitor, particularly the smaller competitors say they\u2019re going to just kill us. It just doesn\u2019t happen. It doesn\u2019t happen for several reasons. One is clients are very resilient. They care about their banker. They\u2019ve taken care of them. And they care about the services that we\u2019re providing. So, the fact that the name change is inherently not a reason to cause these clients to come in and change their business. The clients are resistant to change. If you make a really big mistake, you may have a big snafu that affects it. But the fact that competitors say we\u2019re going to come get the business and all that is not a material issue. Occasionally, we will have somebody that will go kind of way off and start raising rates and all these kind of things and we just counter. And so, we\u2019re not going to sit back and let local competition take our business. So, most important part to answer to your question is keeping our people, because the relationships are between our people and the clients. It\u2019s not between names. And so, we work really, really hard. That\u2019s why we guaranteed upfront our performing client-facing associates on both sides. We\u2019re not seeing any material turnover \u2013 in fact last quarter I got where the turnover is down. So that\u2019s not our concern. But we are ramping up on market again. We\u2019re not taking anything for granted. But first of all, we\u2019re going to talk more to our clients, so they know what\u2019s going on, answer their questions. They like us coming out and talking to them about that. So, on our business side, we\u2019re calling a lot more and on the consumer side we\u2019re interacting with them, answering any questions that they have. But I\u2019ve been on two regional business in the last five or six days. And our people are saying to me that it\u2019s pretty calm out there. The clients are excited about the company. They\u2019re excited about the name. Our associates are really on a high. I mean, they\u2019re actually more pumped than I might have guess at this time. So, I hear all the competitors saying what they\u2019re going to do. But that\u2019s just rhetoric that is irrelevant. Clarke Starnes : Kelly, I would even add, we\u2019re being very focused and be transparent to our people internally so that they know everything we know every step along the way. Kelly King : Yeah. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thank you. Thanks for that. I appreciate it. Kelly King : Sure. Operator : And next up, we\u2019ll take a question from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Kelly King : Good morning. Matt O\u2019Connor: Daryl, I was wondering if you could \u2013 Daryl, I was wondering if you could talk about some of the things that you\u2019ll be looking at within the balance sheet. Have you closed the deal and think about repositioning it for kind of whatever the rate environment is when the deal closes? I mean, obviously, the SunTrust balance sheet gets marked. But you\u2019ll have all those excess capital that you can kind of pick and choose what you want to do with. Call it BBT legacy balance. So maybe just talk about some of the things that you would consider and how that might impact net interest income going forward. Daryl Bible : Yeah, I mean, given the rate environment where we are right now, Matt. The way that you would probably try to enhance run rate is to focus on the liability side of the balance sheet. So, we would have to look at what borrowings we could have changed to maybe improve run rate perspective from that side. Obviously, their derivative position gets marked, so you can adjust what their derivative position is and position the company however you want to do that, without having anything flow through earnings. On the asset side, depending on what \u2013 how management and the board wants, how much negative convexity people want to have on the balance sheet. We do have a large mortgage portfolio. That\u2019s something we will look at and see if we want to shrink that or not. But the easy things would be securities, derivatives and funding, maybe mortgages. I don\u2019t know if we get anything more than that. The auto \u2013 we have a large auto portfolio. But it\u2019s a short portfolio. That\u2019s probably a good portfolio to have with rates so low. But we\u2019ll go through a lot of things. I want to figure out over the next couple of months as we get this deal approved and closed. Matt O\u2019Connor: And then, I guess, just conceptually like is the goal to enhance the NIM as much as you can kind of coming out the deal or is it more about maybe setting the bar to a more appropriate level and kind of protecting the NIM going forward, right? Because conceptually you can \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say plug it for what you want, but if you\u2019re trying to prop the NIM up as much as you can day one, you got to do certain things. On the other hand, if you\u2019re trying to provide for NIM stability beyond day one, you might approach it differently. Daryl Bible : Yeah, I mean, first and foremost, we\u2019re going to make sure that our risk appetite and our capital and liquidity are aligned where we want it to be. At the end of the day, our \u2013 we firmly believe that you want to be paid and have consistent repeatable earnings. So, we want to position the balance sheet to basically produce consistent repeatable earnings quarter after quarter, year after year, and not really try to take the gamble on interest rates or anything else. It\u2019s all about consistency. And that\u2019s how we get the higher P/E level within the industry. So, it\u2019s all trying to do the right things with risk and trying to produce a steady return that we can give to our shareholders and be able to grow it consistently. Matt O\u2019Connor: And then just lastly, the 2% mark taken on SunTrust loans, if credit comes in better than expected, remind me, does that flow through the net interest income if it\u2019s less than the 2% mark that you take? Clarke Starnes : Hey, Matt, this is Clarke. That\u2019s exactly correct. So, we certainly not assume that we would increase that mark. But if our performance is better, we\u2019re going to work really hard really hard to achieve that. We will get a benefit. Christopher Henson : The one nuance is when we adopt CECL first quarter of next quarter, the PCI gets refreshed in the PCD, and that accounting benefit unwinds on that portion of it. But on the non-mark portfolio, the non-PCD portfolio Clarke is correct and that will be the run rate going through the margin. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Thank you. Operator : And our last question will come from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Just one more question on the merger. Could you remind us on how the systems integration is going, whether it\u2019s wholesale and mortgage, and also on the retail side as we contemplate the timing of the cost savings over the next two years? Kelly King : So, Erika, the systems integration planning is going really well. As you know, it\u2019s a large complex organization. And the way we\u2019re approaching it is the best in class. So, we\u2019re looking at all of the systems. They\u2019re all under thorough evaluation as we speak. We\u2019ll be picking the best systems from either side and we are moving along to where we think that will be pretty well decided as we get close to legal day one, and then we\u2019ll go into the process of execution. The actual operational conversion will be multi-faceted. Historically, when we\u2019ve done small acquisitions, it\u2019s kind of like a one weekend big thing. You convert everything. This likely won\u2019t be that. This will likely either be a rolling state by state, where you do all the systems in one state, then another state a month later, et cetera. Or it may be that you do like deposits across all states and you come back a month later and do loans across. So, we haven\u2019t decided that yet, but we\u2019re going to be measured about how we roll that out, just to mitigate and minimize the risk. The wholesale part of the business will be able to integrate faster, just because it\u2019s just not as many pieces. So, wholesale will integrate faster and cost saves will come faster, revenue enhancements will come faster. The retail, the branches take a little longer, just because you just got so many branches and we want to be really careful about that. But even so, we think we\u2019re heading towards a full conversion in the 12 to 18 month kind of timeframe. And as you think about kind of getting to the final run-rate of expenses, that\u2019s kind of timeframe that you ought to be thinking about. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you. And just as a follow-up to Matt\u2019s question, Clarke, as we think about the SunTrust portfolio in a CECL world, I fully understand the conversion of treatment from \u2013 as the loans go from purchase credit impaired to purchase credit deteriorated. But the non-deteriorated portfolio, is there an additional mark that you would have to take if you close the deal in 2019? Christopher Henson : Yeah, I\u2019ll take that one. So, if we close in 2019, we\u2019ll take the normal marks that you would normally do. If we closed in 2020, which we don\u2019t anticipate, basically you take the marks, what we use is the transition benefit of adopting CECL on the SunTrust side of that portion. Does that help? Erika Najarian : Yes, thank you. Christopher Henson : All right. Operator : And that completes today\u2019s Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to Rich Baytosh for closing remarks. Richard Baytosh : Okay. Thank you, Orlando. And thank you for everyone for joining us. I recognize that there were some people still in the queue. And we will get back to you later today. And I hope everybody has a great day. Thank you. Operator : And this concludes today\u2019s call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

And now, I'll turn it over to Kelly. Kelly King : Thank you, Rich. Good morning everybody and thanks for joining our call. This is really a very strong quarter for BB&T, especially when you look at the amount of work and effort that is going in to preparing for our MOE with SunTrust which is going very well and I'll talk about in a bit. It was another quarter that was driven strongly by our non-interest income. Loan growth is very strong, ex the $4.3 billion on a mortgage sale, which we'll talk about a little bit later. We make excellent progress on our MOE with SunTrust and I'll talk more about that in a bit. Just looking at some of the numbers, our adjusted net income was $832 million, up 3.7% versus common quarter. Diluted EPS on an adjusted basis was $1.07, up 3.9% versus common quarter and very respectable returns on an adjusted basis ROA, ROCE, and ROTCE respectively were 1.5%, 11.36%, and 18.07%. Our taxable equivalent revenue was at $3 billion, up 2.5% versus third quarter. Our fee income was very good, $1.3 billion, up $64 million or 5.2%, which is significantly better than our earlier guidance. It was driven by mortgage banking which was up 42%. Insurance is really outperforming, up organically 8.7% versus third quarter of 2018, Chris is going to give you more color on that in a bit. And also our investment banking and brokerage were up 12% on a like quarter basis. So loans held for investments were actually down 4.8%, but again, if you exclude this $4.3 billion on a mortgage sale, we're up 6.5%, which was over our guidance. Daryl can give you more detail if you have questions, but the $4.3 billion mortgage sale was simply purchase loans that we have purchased at a premium, they were paying off at an accelerated rate, it makes sense for us to effectively redeem those or pay \u2013 sell those and it improved our rate positioning going forward. Our reported NIM decreased five basis points to 3.37%; core NIM decreased also five basis points. But if you exclude the loan sale, reported and core NIM only decreased two basis points and again Daryl is going to give you a lot of color with regard to that. Our adjusted efficiency ratio was 57.1%, down slightly from 57.3% on a common quarter. Expenses reflect high incentives and commissions versus the third quarter 2018 due to the improved performance in insurance mortgage banking and investment banking and brokerage. Credit quality was really strong. We'll answer questions about that, but across-the-board, credit quality continues to be very, very strong. We did have some strategic activity during the quarter. We redeemed $1.7 billion of preferred stock and replaced it with a like amount at lower cost which is just an economic transaction. We did sell the $4.3 billion, I just talked about. We did increase our dividend 11.1% at July meeting, which is a very very healthy three-plus percent dividend yield. We also did receive shareholder approval, which is a nearly unanimous of BB&T and SunTrust on the merger and on the name. And we have talked about -- and we have named 75% of our Truist leaders. I'm going to give a little bit more detail in just a minute about the overall really positive progress that we've made with regard to the upcoming merger. If you follow along on Page 5, on the selected items, just to call these out. As I said, we had preferred stock redemption where we were covering the expense of the capitalized insurance -- issuance cost that was $46 million pre and after-tax, $0.06 a share, a negative hit. Incremental operating expenses related to the merger was $40 million after-tax, that was $0.05 negative hit. Merger-related and restructuring charges of $26 million after, which is $0.03. Now on the positive side, we did have a gain on the impact of the mortgage sale; that was the positive $0.02. So, when you net that out, we had a negative impact on EPS of $0.12 for the quarter. So, if you want to take a look at the next slide, Slide 6 on loan growth. I feel really good about loan growth. If you look at the underlying performance, again ex the mortgage sale, we had 6.5% annualized, which is very strong, I think relative to what's going on in marketplace, what's happening with a lot of our competitors. Very pleased with C&I, was up 7.6% third quarter to second quarter annualized. We did have a very low performance in CRE, very much by design, as we talked to you last couple of quarters, we've been dialing back because we've seen some fluffiness in some of the CRE categories, and so we're being careful about that. But if you look on the table, I won't go through all of them. If you look on the table on Page 6, you will see that the C&I performance was really broad based across eight or 10 different categories. So, it's not just a one-off type of loan category performance. It's really, really broad based and that's very, very good. Our mortgage loan by the way did very well; they were up 7.4% versus second quarter once you exclude the sale. So just talking then about what's going on in the marketplace. As all of you I'm sure know it's difficult to figure out what's going on with all of the conversation, much of the rhetoric, but what I tried to do is just talk to our people, talk to clients and see what's going on. The fact is today, as I just indicated, our clients are still borrowing. They still feel basically confident. Our production and our pipelines are very strong. But I will tell you that there is more conversation going on today about concerns about the trade wars, it's beginning to create a level of uncertainty. And even though the economy is still strong today, over time uncertainly will begin to integrate in terms of negative impact in the economy. We saw some negative retail sales yesterday. Is that a one-off? We just don't know. I personally think it's challenging for all of us to be calm right now, not try to draw a huge conclusions of individual anecdotes to pop-up every day or sometimes multiple times during the day. It's better, in my view, to back away and take a long view. And the truth is the long view of the U.S. economy today is very strong. We do have these clouds around the globe in terms of Brexit, although there was some potential positive good news out of that this morning, I personally think we'll have a reasonable trade deal with China by the end of the year. I personally think we'll have the new NAFTA approved and we will head into 2020 with substantially better sense of feeling of confidence than we have today. But I could be wrong and that's why we've been very cautious in terms of everything we do, in terms of capital liquidity and diversification, because we simply are in an environment where to place a high bet on any one scenario up or down is not a smart bet. So, we've been cautious. We're basically guiding to neutral, with a slight psychological attempt towards the upside which we think will serve us well. If you look at Page 7, on deposits, I was very pleased with deposits. Obviously, this is kind of the big story today. How we all react to the substantial decline in the long and the potentially inverted yield curve back and forth kind of every day. It's very challenging for everybody. We are doing very well. Our total deposits third to second are up 5.2%. We are managing the categories, like for example, our non-interest bearing deposits are down 1.4%, that's kind of the normal kind of disintermediation that's going on across the industry today. The 1.4% is really pretty low in that environment. Our money market and savings were up 9.6%. So that's looking very good. So we've seen some movement in the categories, but when you get through that 5.2% is a very, very strong. We see a little movement in our mix, but our non-interest-bearing deposits are holding strong. Our client deposits relative to national market funding actually increased 3.6% annualized versus to second quarter of 2019. Our cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.99%, down three basis points versus second quarter. And cost of total deposits was 0.67%, down one basis point. So, really good management there by Daryl and Donna and all of our people in Treasury. So I feel very, very good about that. It will be problematic, as we go forward, if we have some substantial spike down or up, we are not actually expecting that. We're planning to be relatively neutral going forward, but with a psychological little bit up. And with that, let me pass it over to Daryl. Daryl Bible : Thank you, Kelly, and good morning everyone. Today, I'm going to talk about our excellent asset quality, margin dynamics, solid fee income, expenses, and provide guidance for the fourth quarter. Turning to slide 8. Asset quality remains excellent. Net charge-offs were $153 million, up three basis points as a percentage of average loans. This was largely due to indirect loan seasonality and the resolution of a commercial credit. Our non-performing asset ratio was 22 basis points and is better than the previous we've seen in 2006. Continuing on slide 9. Our allowance coverage ratios remain strong. The allowance ratio was primarily impacted by the sale of $4.3 billion of residential mortgage loans and the resolution of a commercial credit, which lowered the reserve for unfunded commitments. Including these one-time items, the allowance to loan ratio remained at 1.05%. The provision was $117 million, below net charge-offs of $153 million. Turning to slide 10. Reported net interest margin decreased two basis points after adjusting for the sale of residential mortgage loans and related reinvestments. You might recall that the timing differences between the settlement of the mortgage sale and the securities reinvestment temporarily increased earning assets by about $2 billion and impacted the margin by three basis points. Excluding these items, core margin was also decreased two basis points. Net interest margin was impacted by lower rates, which reduced annualized yields by seven basis points on the loan portfolio and two basis points on the securities portfolio. The cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased three basis points, which partially offset the drop in asset yields. We pre-invested $5 billion in securities late in the third quarter to build liquidity for the merger and that reduced our asset sensitivity. This also creates negative pressure on our standalone margins in the fourth quarter. In addition, we are evaluating opportunities to restructure our balance sheet as we wait for the merger close. Continuing on slide 11. Non-interest income was $1.3 billion, up 5.2% versus like quarter. Our fee income ratio was 43.4%, down seasonally from 44.4%. Insurance income was down $79 million due to seasonality, but increased 8.7% from a year ago on firming market pricing and organic growth. Mortgage banking income was stable as higher production and servicing related revenues of $24 million were offset by a decline of $25 million in net MSR valuation. Investment banking and brokerage commissions were relatively flat, but up 12% versus last year. This was primarily due to higher managed fee accounts, service charges on deposits increased $7 million, partly reflecting more days in the quarter. Other income increased $35 million, primarily due to a $23 million increase in income related to assets for certain post-employment benefits and $17 million from client derivatives. Turning to slide 12. Non-interest expense was $1.8 billion, an increase of $89 million. The increase was largely driven by merchs and MOE expenses, which are up a combined $54 million. Merchs totaled $34 million, which included relocation expenses, legal fees, project management costs and professional services. MOE expenses were $52 million, which included $39 million for personnel and $12 million for professional services. You can see the details on page 16 in our quarterly performance summary. Core expenses were up $35 million, including $9 million increase for professional services, $6 million increase in personnel expense, which includes $23 million increase for certain post-employment benefit expense that was offset by decrease incentives and equity-based comp and a $19 million increase in other expense due to higher advertising and marketing costs and other items. Expenses increased 1.7% or $30 million from last year, excluding Merchs and MOE expenses. Year-over-year increase in adjusted non-interest expense was primarily driven by $18 million increase in personnel expense due to higher incentives, $34 million increase in expense reflecting higher non-service related pension expense, higher operating charge-offs, higher advertising and marketing costs, which was partially offset by a $17 million decrease in regulatory charges. FTEs were essentially flat versus second quarter, but down approximately $1,500 from year ago. Turning to slide 13. Capital and liquidity remain strong. The CET ratio was 10.6%, up 20 basis points due to strong earnings in the mortgage loan sale. The dividend payout and total payout ratios were 46.9%. We issued $1.7 billion of preferred stock and redeemed the similar amount of higher cost issuances, which will save $4 million per quarter and have an earned back of 2.8 years. Our modified average LCR ratio was 139%. To build liquidity for the merger, we pre-invested high quality liquid assets at the end of the third quarter to facilitate compliance with the LCR ratio for Truist. In addition, we issued debt to build parent company cash which now exceeds $10 billion. These actions will provide negative pressure to BB&T's net interest margin, but it's prudent for Truist starting out with very strong liquidity. Now let's turn to slide 14 to review segment. Community Bank Retail and Consumer Finance net income increased slightly to $446 million. Fee income decreased $15 million, primarily due to the decline in the net MSR valuation, partially offset by increased production revenue. Average loans and leases decreased $2.5 billion, reflecting the mortgage loan sale. Loan yields increased 12 basis points, while interest-bearing deposit costs were down four basis points. Non-interest-bearing deposits were about flat. And residential mortgage originations were up 11% from second quarter, production mix was 68% purchase and 32% refi. And excluding the mortgage loan sale, a gain on sale margins declined 28 basis points due to a mix change to higher corresponding production. Continuing on slide 15. Community Bank Commercial net income was $19 million -- increased $19 million to $338 million. Loan production increased 22% as higher C&I and CRE production offset lower dealer floor plan production. Loan yields were down 17 basis points versus interest-bearing cost down only one basis point. Non-interest-bearing deposits were essentially flat. Turning to slide 16. Financial Services and Commercial Finance net income was $185 million, an increase of $16 million. Total revenue increased $26 million, primarily due to higher Grandbridge income, capital markets and client derivative revenue. Average loan balances grew 7.6% annualized, helped by equipment finance and corporate banking. Loan yields were down 15 basis points and interest-bearing deposit costs were down 13 basis points. Non-interest-bearing deposits were flat from last quarter. Additionally, invested assets increased $2.7 billion versus linked quarter and $5.3 billion versus last year. Turning to slide 17. Insurance Holdings net income decreased $50 million to $61 million, primarily due to seasonality. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Chris to provide more perspective on our performance this quarter. Chris Henson : Thanks, Daryl. So if you turn to page 18, purposely two slides really to reinforce our transformation plan that we call IHOP was Insurance Holdings Operating Plan continues to gain momentum. This is the plan John Howard shared with you last fall at Investor Day and it's really built with assistance from BCG, a little more than a year ago, about 15 months or so. It's built around 32 initiatives that we're working to execute over the next three years. And as I said, we're about a year in. It includes implementation of new operating models, both in retail and wholesale, and a myriad of other revenue growth and expense synergy initiatives. And if you look at the upper left hand chart there on page 18, you can see revenue for the segments up 9.3% or $44 million like quarter. As I've pointed out overtimes in the past, really three drivers of the strong organic growth. First is good client retention and retail were up about 91%, wholesale about 76%. New business volume, not renewals, totally new business volume was up 17% like quarter, that's the best number that I ever remember seeing. And what\u2019s more impressive is it has built each quarter throughout the year. And then the third driver really is pricing. And on the heels of the two largest insurable last years in 2017 and 2018, we're continuing to see price lift, because of the tightening capacity in the market. So, for example, second quarter, it was up about 3.5% this quarter, up about 4%. So retention in new business and pricing is really driving the result you see in the lower left hand corner of organic growth. So organic growth is up 200 basis points to 8.7% in the quarter, which is about double what we would expect to see in the industry. We expect probably mid-fours in the industry. We believe the backdrop allows for additional tightening of capacity and continued lift in pricing as we go through 2019. If we flip over page 19. I would say that IHOP was really designed to help us drive be laser focused on enhancing the margin and then using the dollars of EBITDA production to reinvest in the business. So we have, I'd just point out, in almost every business, new technology implementations, which will help both revenue and cost in the future. If you look at the chart upper left there, EBITDA, you can see absolute EBITDA is up $24 million like quarter to 27.6%. And the strong organic growth that I shared with you on the prior page combined with good solid cost control. And then the third leg was really, you will remember we acquired Regions, July of last year, we're now 15 months into that and we have exceeded all of our expense and revenue synergies and the combination of those three things have really helped us drive the result in the lower left chart on page 19, which is the EBITDA margin. You can see our margin like quarter is up 310 basis points to 21.4%. Now this is the lowest quarter of the year for us, so if you look at what our year-to-date margin would be, it would be in the 25% range. So a lot of improvement has been made in margin enhancement. And lastly, I'd just leave you with a lot of focus on use of data and analytics to really help our underwriters better understand the true risk in the client, which helps them long-term, keep their rates down and I'll say that's especially in wholesale. So in summary, just continue to be very pleased with the progress that we have made in Insurance. I'll turn it back to Daryl. Daryl Bible : Thank you, Chris. Continuing on slide 20, you will see our outlook. The following guidance is based on BB&T standalone. However, we continue to expect the merger of equals with SunTrust will close in the fourth quarter. We expect total loans held for investment to be flat versus third quarter mainly due to seasonality. Excluding this, loans would be up 1% to 3% versus linked quarter. We expect net charge-offs to be in the range of 35 basis points to 45 basis points and the provision is expected to match net charge-offs plus loan growth. We also expect GAAP and core net interest margin to be down 7 basis points to 9 basis points. As we discussed earlier, we are building liquidity for the merger for LCR, our liquid asset buffer and parent company cash. This will negatively impact net interest margin by approximately three to five basis points in the fourth quarter. Adjusted for the liquidity build, we expect net interest margin to decrease three to five basis points. We anticipate fee income to be up 2% to 4% versus light quarter driven by insurance and mortgage banking. We expect expenses, excluding merger related expenses to be flat versus light quarter. We expect one-time expenses for the MOE to be about $60 million to $80 million in the fourth quarter, mainly driven by personnel and professional costs. And we anticipate an effective tax rate of 20% to 21%. Finally, BB&T's full year guidance remains intact. In a challenging rate environment, we will continue to grow our revenues faster than expenses, driving positive operating leverage. We will be more pronounced, which we more pronounced once we close the MOE. In summary, the quality of our core earnings this quarter was excellent, resulting in strong loan growth, solid fee income versus last year, and excellent asset quality. Now let me turn it back to Kelly for an update on the merger of equals and closing Q&A. Kelly King : Thanks, Daryl. So as you can see, it was -- it really was a great quarter. And I particularly highlight the work that has been done in the loan area and the expense area and insurance area, all very, very good. So let me give you a few comments with regard to the merger update, which is going extremely well. Our executive management team, which is the 14, all the seven things continues to meet weekly. The team is working extremely well together. I cannot be more pleased. If you were claw on the wall, watching us meet, you would have thought we've been working together for years and years and years. Bill and I are working together extremely well. The whole team is working together well, and I must tell you, I really appreciate it. The focus of the team and the focus is working together and we're focused on the goal for making through this number one best financial institution that we possibly can. Making great progress in terms of naming the key leadership. Recently we've named 8,000 positions, which is about 75% of the leadership roles. We lead about legal day one of close virtually all positions will be named and everybody will be ready to go. We've been very successful in meeting our diversity goals, which is one of our primary focuses. And we've done a really good job of picking benefits programs going forward for Truist. One of the great things about an MOE is you really get a chance to look at both companies and take the best of each side, and that's what we've done with regard to benefits. So we're going to have a world standard and benefit program. And remember the word of our clients, communities and shareholders, it really makes worth for our teammates and associates. So, we feel really, really good about that. So we've had some remarks in terms of activity. July of 30th, SunTrust and BB&T shareholders, both almost unanimously approved the deal and the name. With regard to the regulatory process, it has been approved by North Carolina Commissioner of Banks, which is very important. The next step is approval of our divestiture plan by the Department of Justice. And then we believe that the remaining regulatory approvals will follow. We feel good about where things stand with the regulators. They are being delivered, given the size and significance of this deal as they should be and as we are been. I mean, so everybody has the same goal of making sure that when we move forward with this, that we've got it all the -- policies. And so, given all of that, we believe that we are still on track for a closing in the fourth quarter, we can't guarantee that, but we believe that we are based on all of the information that we have at this time. We've made really good progress in the last several months with regard to merging the technology of the two companies. So during September, we finalized the vast majority of the technology ecosystems. And remember what we try to do there is we pick the best of breed. So SunTrust has the best teller program. We've picked our program, we have the best loan system, we picked that system. So the end result is, you get really, really first-class systems across the board, which is fantastic. We did recently complete a dress rehearsal for legal day one close. There are about 100 merger related work streams that had to be tested and they all passed very, very well. So we are ready for the legal day one close. Very, very importantly, we have had two offsite several day meetings, working on developing the Truist culture. This has not been a process of throwing out BB&T and throwing out SunTrust, it\u2019s been a process of taking the best of each one. And I've been extremely excited about how this has worked. The culture, as we define it, is our purpose, our mission and our values and then the various activity approaches kind of the way we do things around here. We've already agreed to our purpose, our mission and our values. And I'll tell you that Bill and I are very passionate about this, the process. We believe it's the most important part of the entire journey and we could not feel better. The teams had a complete meeting of demands, good discussion but no aggravated interaction, no real divergent views, just really fine tuning of wording in terms of how we present this to the world. So, frankly, it is doing extraordinarily well. We could not feel better. Our teams are 100% aligned. I would tell you, as we roll this out later that our purpose, mission and values are engaging and very, very exciting. So as we go forward, once we have legal day one, there will be a number of things that will happen, kind of the first thing is we have to affirm for the Board all various committees and policies and practices all of which are being worked on now by various groups. So we're ready to go day one to present all of that to the new company board, Truist board, to be able to approve all of that. We will share shortly after that our purpose, mission and values with all teammates. We think that our number one job is to get out. We planned kind of roadshow, if you will, to get out and talk to our teams across the entire enterprise about our culture. We are working through our marketing area on our branding plan, closing out on that, making really, really good progress. So that's very, very exciting. And as that rolls out, there will be more excitement. We remain importantly very confident in achieving our $1.6 billion in net cost saves. And I would say that, well, in our view that we have not included in any of the numbers any revenue opportunities, but we're doing a lot of work on that. Bill and Chris are leading the effort with regard to focusing on revenue opportunities and they're on around 20 different work streams right now in terms of pretty low fruit. And so, we wanted to be conservative in our projections. I'll just tell you there are huge opportunities when you combine these two companies, because there's virtually and no overlap. There's just opportunity to take what SunTrust does and bring it over to BB&T and take what BB&T does and take it over to SunTrust, and we know how to do that. And so we are very, very excited about that. I'll tell you that when we announced this deal back in February, I was very, very excited. Today, I'm even more excited, I'm more confident than before and here is my why. So the deal is basically the same, so the synergies are as good as they were, economic opportunity is good, transformative nature of this in terms of making it a little better is good. But now a lot much into the process, I feel even better because our executive team is deep, it's strong, it's committed, our teammates are excited, they see that we're all the same, they see opportunities are same. We truly believe that we can help our clients have a brighter financial future. We can create a place where our teammates will enjoy and have a long and fulfilling career. We believe our communities need help today. The world is changing, really fast. We are having a dramatic increase in the gap in terms of economic inequality, and we don't feel good about that, and we want to do our part. And I can tell you that on legal day one, Truist will be ready to be a leader in finding solutions to making life better. And, of course, we will, through all of these efforts, optimize the long-term return to our shareholders, which we feel very, very confident about. So I want to thank you Bill and the SunTrust team and all of my fellow BB&T associates and thank you for all the hard work that\u2019s going in to it. Pretty soon, we will be one team. I'll tell you all, we are ready go. Back to you, Rich. Rich Baytosh : Thank you, Kelly. John, at this time if you would come back on the line and explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from John McDonald of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is open. John McDonald : Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask, Daryl, just a question on the fourth quarter outlook. When we kind of combined the outlook for loans to be relatively flat and NIM to be down, if we add in then, I guess, the average securities are probably up, given the liquidity build. How does the dollars of NII look, how should we think about that for the fourth quarter? Daryl Bible : I would say, John, that if you look at our linked quarter, it probably be down a touch, just because of the drop that we have in margin and flat earnings assets for the most part of linked quarter. A lot of that is just due to seasonality on the loan side, like I said in the prepared remarks. And then the margin decline, core margin's really down 3 to 5 basis points. The rest of it is just due to building up excess liquidity for a combination with SunTrust, so that we can have strong liquidity, our CR ratios and just strong overall cash on hand and how we're going to run our company. John McDonald : Got it. That's great. And then, just a bigger picture question in terms of Truist MOE. The environment's changed since February, and you've also had a chance to fine tune your assumptions with the third-party review. Do you have any updates on kind of the financial targets that you set out for the 51% cash efficiency and ROTCE of 22. Obviously, there is a lot to change in the further out, but any updates on that? Kelly King : John, this is Kelly. The market is substantially different than it was back in February. The most difficult thing to \u2013 but our efficiency ratio because the denominator is under a lot of pressure. We believe with regard to efficiency ratio, whether we hit 51 or not, we believe we will be top in class in terms of our efficiency ratio. I would say, I feel more confident in the 22% return on tangible common equity. So regardless of whether the numbers are exactly what we've said nine months ago, because the world has changed, we think there will be a top performer, but Daryl any comment on that? Daryl Bible : Yes. I would say, John, is we still have 100% clarity between both companies. So we have high-level estimates. I would say once we close this quarter, if we give us a little bit of time, a month or so, we'll come out with more clear guidance on a go-forward basis on the timing of our cost saves and how we're going to get the cost saves. So we know you guys need that information and we will provide it for you, but we got to get the deal closed, and we have to make sure we understand where all the savings dollars are coming from first. John McDonald : Totally understand. Thanks very much guys. Operator : Thanks, John. So we'll now move on to our next question from John Pancari of Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Kelly King : John? John Pancari : Sorry, about that. Yes. Just back to the deal close discussion. I know, Kelly, you mentioned that you're confident in the fourth quarter close of the deal, but you also indicated you can't guarantee it. Is there anything that's leading you to believe that it could be after 4Q, any change in your thinking as you're going through the process where you're thinking it could be into next year? Daryl Bible : Well, as I said, John, we're focusing on the fourth quarter. Obviously, we are aware that it possibly could slip through the first quarter and we're giving some thought to that, but most of our focus is on the fourth quarter. We are not aware of any reason to expect to go into the first quarter. I only say that, today this is beyond our control. This is in the regulatory framework. And they move it at their own pace. And so all we can do is, give you our best information based on what we know. And based on what I now know I still expect a fourth quarter close. John Pancari : Okay. All right. Got it. Thank you. And then separately, Daryl, I know you mentioned that in your remarks you're evaluating additional opportunities for the restructuring of the balance sheet. I know you've already prefunded the merger, as well as sold some of the residential mortgage portfolio, but just want to get \u2013 if you can elaborate possibly on what incremental actions you could evaluate for the balance sheet? Thanks? Daryl Bible : So, John, I mean, both companies are looking at their balance sheets very thoroughly right now. Kelly said earlier, one of the things we want to do when we combine is, we want to make sure that our interest rate sensitivity is relatively neutral to slightly biased up a little bit. But try to get it to be more neutral, so we don't have a huge impact to NII as rates continue to change. We also, as I said earlier, would have strong liquidity. From a credit perspective, if there are certain portfolios or loans that can be sold that Clarke and Ellen Koebler want to get after balance sheet, you know we will take advantage and do that as well. And lastly, what we will look at, assets not so much a decision on the business, but if there is assets on the books that might be marginally not the best performance from our capital return perspective, we might see us shed some of those as well. So all that's coming together, we'll have more color on that later in the quarter as we close. John Pancari : Okay, great. Thanks, Daryl. Operator : We will now move onto our next question from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Mike Mayo : Hi. It's another question on the merger. So you say, 75%, the leadership roles name when do you get to 100%. You say you have most of the tech ecosystems identified what do you have left there? And most importantly, I know you've been asked twice already, but can you put more meat on the bones on the technology related savings. I mean, that was the number one reason for merger so that you can make more tech investment, can get more added tech and so what have you learnt over these last nine months? Thanks. Kelly King : Yeah. So with regard to the staffing, I fully expect virtually 100% of all the staffing to be agreed to -- by around 1st of November and we're very close. It's -- there won't be many that we'll be hanging out there by 1st of November. In terms of the ecosystems, we've covered all of them. And so that was 100 net volumes, so we're going through that thoroughly. And so we feel really, really good. And that's the first step by the way in the whole conversion process. You simply have to decide which ecosystems and then all the various systems within those ecosystems. So all of that is going along really, really well. We are completely on-track with regard to that. In terms of the technology savings, you know it has multiple facets. The first thing is, you have redundant hardware, which of course goes away. You have -- you have redundant programmers with regard to willingly offering to the redundant hardware systems and tuner for software systems. You know when you pick one system over another system that necessarily frees up expense system -- with regard to that. And then of course, you're thinking in terms of reinvesting for the technology of the future. And you're right -- when we announced this deal, we said this was really about putting together two companies that of course will become more economically sound, but really leaning into the future by investing in technology that would allow us to be a leader with regard to meeting our clients' needs. That's a process that\u2019s light as easy and to be honest, as you know, hook in the computers up of the existing systems because we're having to look at what's available today out there that we don't have. And to be honest, it is not a lot out there today that we don't have. We are in really good shape. If you look at like our digital platform, I mean, we're constantly rated as number one, two and three in the entire system -- including all the big banks, despite what some people say it as, we are extremely well positioned with regard to that. But the world change really fast and so we have to invest a lot to purely stay at the top. And then, we are already beginning to do work in terms of thinking about what's the next step, what's the new frontier, what is the next investment that we can make that will substantially improve the lives of our clients. And so, that's what this whole innovation center is all about. It is creating a group of teams. So we have 20 to 40 agile teams that will be focusing on improving the existing products and services and approaches, but creating new products and services and small business in retail across the board. We are canvassing the world in terms of what's out there. We don't believe in recreating at will to something out there around the world that we can bring to our clients, we want to do that. But we also recognize that this world is changing so fast that there is opportunity for us to create a new will. And so innovation is about all this whole process. So the mechanics of all that is very complicated, but it's really a bifurcated process hooking into existing computers up and then say, people kind of chuckle when I say, but it really is that simple, is hooking the computers out and make sure we operate efficiently from day one and then making sure we're layering on top of that improvements that will make our clients' life better. Mike Mayo : And then just one follow-up. So November 1st you have all the leadership identified that would be good. But culturally, you gave a presentation recently talking about the cultural similarities and you gave some data. And I didn't really understand that data, I mean, it seem kind of pie in the sky to me, and look you're close to the situation, you're dealing with the employees, you're saying, hey culturally we're similar. Many people on the outside who have policy for a decade or two say, you know what you guys really aren't similar BB&T and SunTrust. I guess, where is the disconnect and the perceptions about the difference in cultures and what you're fighting out? And when there are differences, how are those resolved? Kelly King : Well, I'm not sure which meeting you're talking about, but\u2026 Mike Mayo : I think the Barclays Conference\u2026 Kelly King : I don't most -- I don't most believe in times, so I would just put that out there, I\u2019ll try to be straightforward and honest about everything I\u2019d say and be always light, I'll tell you truth. And so, what I was referring to is that, we've had a number of statistically valid feedback sessions from 20,000 plus of SunTrust and BB&T clients that have associates -- I'm sorry associates that have validated what I said. So for example early on when we were doing the name research, we had 20,000 plus responses to our 10,000 from each side, and we gave down a list of 16 words to describe the companies and all groups on both sides picked the exact same four words, which is pretty incredible. And then, we did a more sophisticated study in terms of, kind of, how we do business around here, kind of the behavioural aspects of culture. And we were shown by the research people, statistically driven graphs that showed BB&T associate responses and SunTrust associate responses and it was a virtual complete overlap, meaning whether the masses of our employees and you asked him how do you feel about this or that or the other, they gave you the exact or same response. And I guess that anecdotally when I'm travelling around into field and talking to our people and when I ran into SunTrust people, you know, I just ask, how is it going? This is going great. We work together. We had lunch together, non-competitively, but I think they know each other, they're all friends. And I talk about each other just very positively and affirmatively. And so, when you put all that together, I'm quite certain there are no material deficit. It is always understood when you guys have big companies. I'm sure you'd find something which is different about the companies. But where there are, you know what I call manual differences, they will just fade as we come together as Truist and operate under our new purpose, mission and values. So they will just fade away. If we were to encounter in a material, which we not, we would deal with it straight up and the executive team and we were the richer consensus and move forward. But we've covered a lot of issues. At this point, it has been nine months we have covered a lot of warfront and the teams are working great as I've said, and we've not discovered material issues that I could say you was a real culture crack. Bill Rogers and I have this working arrangement together where we talk about no light between us and so we've committed to each other very deeply that, if either one of us see any light, we get on the phone immediately, talk about it and we haven't found any light yet. I'm not saying we won't, but I don't think we will. But we have the mechanism and a commitment and the trust between Bill and I and all the way through the teams that, if we do have issues we deal with them promptly, quickly and decisive. Mike Mayo : Thank you. Operator : We will now move on to our next question from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Betsy Graseck : Hey, good morning. Kelly S. King: Good morning. Betsy Graseck : A couple of questions. First just a clarification, Daryl, on kind of the LCR in the commentary you gave around HQLA and retooling the balance sheet a little bit for -- of post merger. On Page 10, when we look at the change in NII scenarios and you've got this negative sensitivity both down 100 and down, and up 200. I just want to get how are you thinking about what that looks like post merger, because I don't think you would set yourself up like this on a standalone basis. So just want to understand where this is going and whether or not you had to get ready for LCR even if the tailoring rule didn't go through. In other words, are you carrying a little bit too much HQLA at this stage, post tailoring rule or not? Just if you could speak to that a little bit. Daryl Bible : So we are still working on our numbers, at the 85% number. Both companies operated at 70%. So, we will have to have one form or another higher \u2013 high quality assets on our balance sheet. We'll take some form. So we started to build that at the end of this past quarter. So that's it. From a interest rate sensitivity, by us purchasing those securities, we also did unwound some pay fixed swaps, put on some receive fixed swaps. It did create us, so that again we improved our sensitivities on the downside, but it hurt on the upside. No, ideally when we close or shortly thereafter, we would want it to be somewhat symmetrical in that. We would so probably lose a little bit on the downside, but benefit on the upside as we work on that. Donna and her team are working together and they are coming up with strategies post legal day one, such that, we will try to get into that position. You're right. We were kind of, cut in the middle of what we're trying to do right now is what you saw at the end of this quarter, but we will work towards that, and we'll see how that all comes together. But I feel confident we'll get into a position where we need to be post close. Betsy Graseck : And that's \u2013 you know, in parts because STI is a little more asset sensitive than you, I'm guessing is part of that answer? Daryl N. Bible: Yeah. That's true. That is true. That will help some exactly and I think there will be some other adjustments we might make as well. Betsy Graseck : And then just separately, Daryl, could you speak and Kelly could you speak a little bit too, how you're thinking about the buybacks as you get to close and then beyond close. I think last time we spoke, there was an expectation that the CET1 might be closer to 10%, but then there was some mid-quarter release that talked \u2013 that seemed like maybe it would be a little bit below 10% at close. So, if you tell us where the parts are moving there and how it impacts your outlook for the buyback? Kelly King : So, Betsy, just at a general level, you'll recall that we said that we want to target 10% CET1 at close and we really are not going to consider buybacks until after we hit that level. Now, I recognize that many investors have already asked me, why do you need such a hefty CET1 level, because that's got a lot of cushion and at which it does. But the reason is, because we going through a whopping big merger, which has got a lot of uncertainty, the economic environment has uncertainty, geopolitical events have uncertainty. So, for all those reasons, we are conservative and they still stock on 10%. So, there I'll give you a little color on just a second about kind of where we are. From my point of view, it's hard to know and it kind of depends on what rates are. These marks are huge impact in terms of capital position, but it's going to be close to 10%, which means it's not going to be too far past legal day one that we'll be back in about their business, but these specific dates, Daryl, can give you a better feel. Daryl Bible : Yeah. So, where we stand right now, right now, we'll probably a touch under and \u2013 but as Kelly said, we don't really know the exact date we're going to close when interest rates are. We're still working with Deloitte, our third-party on the actual mark for SunTrust all that is coming together nicely. My guess is, we'll be close to 10%, we may not be at 10% right now, but it also depends on depending on what assets we decide to share or whatever could have an RWA left potentially. So you never know as how you get there right now. It's \u2013 we're in the hunt, but there is no guarantee that we will be 10% or close. But this \u2013 this company combine generates a lot of capital, a lot of earnings, and we will get to 10% I think in a relatively short amount of time. But it's still a wild card that you don't really know, because rates are so volatile right now where you're going to be. I just know that we have a lot of flexibility and we're working to try to do what we can to maximize and optimize the balance sheet. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Good. All right. And Kelly your point is that 10s high number anyway? Kelly King : Right, it does. Betsy Graseck : All right. Thank you. Kelly King : Thank you. Operator : We will now move on to our next question from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ken Usdin : Thanks guys. Good morning, everyone. A follow-up on just things that are going to be potentially slipping time wise depending on the close date, but Daryl, any understanding at least on the BB&T side of what the expected seasonal day one looks like and then just any considerations in terms of any changes with regards to how you think the credit mark looks and potential breakdown of that credit mark? Thanks. Daryl Bible : Yeah. So, I mean for BB&T, our CECL reserves are going to be higher than where we operate \u2013 and we incurred right now. We're probably up in the neighborhood of 30% to 50% in that range. All that could be a moot point when we \u2013 if we close this quarter, in the fourth quarter. So, Clarke and Ellen Koebler and our teams have been working on the combined choice number. We are at a point now where we can disclose that number. We have to still work on that, but the teams are working together and just coming up with it. As far as the purchase accounting marks go, I would say when we announced this transaction in February, we were saying the credit mark would be 2%. We believe the marks are coming in close to that level, but that's not final yet. It could be a little give or take, plus or minus on that, but I think we're in the ballpark of that. The other marks on the liquidity and interest rate marks right now, it is at a slight discount, but that's also volatile to what happens in the marketplace. Hopefully, that's helpful. Ken Usdin : Yeah. Thank you. And I'll follow-up just on the insurance side, you talked a lot about the color, how that current business trends are going from a growth perspective. Can you talk about how insurance is expected to grow within the outlook you had given for total fees, just in terms of a ballpark of the type of growth rate that you think it could be sustained in the insurance business? Thank you. Kelly King : Sure. For fourth quarter, we \u2013 this is our lowest quarter of the year seasonally. Fourth quarter will be our second lowest. So we would expect from here, commissions to step-up in the 3% range. But \u2013 so we're looking out further in fourth and maybe the first half of 2020. What you have really is post the two years, large years of insurable loss of 2017, 2018 as I had mentioned earlier, you have tightening of capacity in the market such that there is still upward pressure on pricing. It is hard to know exactly sort of how long that last. But certainly, fourth quarter, we expect it to hold possibly, even push-up a bit depending on how the reinsurance renewals go in January and I think you also could see some further commitment to that pressure. So when we look at the balance of the year, we're expecting sort of full year organic growth to come in at least for us in the 6% to 7% kind of range. We're \u2013 year-to-date, we're at 9.1% right now. Possibly, we could beat those numbers and we expect the industry probably be in the mid-4s. So I think building very, very strong about the backdrop of the market as a result of that, but also I would say, because of the half approach we started over a year ago, we feel really good about our team. As I said, our new business growth has built upon itself every quarter throughout this year, and we've got a technology going in, in just about every business which has helped us be more efficient, more effective. So I think the prospects for us to outperform the market as we look forward are very, very solid, both in margin and in overall growth. Ken Usdin : Thank you. Operator : We'll move on to our next question from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. Kelly King : Good morning. Daryl Bible : Good morning. Matt O'Connor: First, I just wanted to follow-up on the capital discussion. I can appreciate you want to keep little more capital as integrations going on. But as you think kind of post-integration or once you're confident in the execution of the integration, we see the 10% CET1, is really kind of well above where some of your direct peers are pointing to. You might have seen yesterday, a very similar bank to you in size, talked about bringing it down to 9%, another one is in the 8.5% to 9% range. So I'm just wondering, if you can give some thoughts on kind of medium-term post some of the deal integration. What do you think that ongoing CET1 target might be? Kelly King : So I think, predicting what your capital level needs to be out in the future here is a bit of guessing game because you really can't predetermine what your capital levels are going to unless you predetermine what then existing circumstances are going to be. So it always has to be a hedge. The best way to think about us is relative to the environment. So if the environment is relatively risky, you will see us being relatively more conservative in terms of capital, liquidity, and we will always have strong diversification. Capital and liquidity vary depending on the circumstances that we see at the time and the forecast that we made. As I said earlier, today from a conservative point of view, you just have to recognize that doing a large deal there are just lots of issues while we feel extraordinary confident about the conversion and all of that, but still think that I can't guarantee. And you know, and my prediction is by the end of the year we will have a carried over reconciliation and a NAFTA approval \u2013 new NAFTA approval, et cetera, but I can't guarantee that. So when you threw all that, that anchors you back to the 10. Now to your point about, all those moving to 9% or so, I certainly don't think -- I mean, when we get to a more tranquil or predictable environment, I don't think 9% is going to inappropriate at all. I think cushioned down to 8.5%, which still gives you 150 basis points over the minimum kind of 7. But remember 7 is really hard. So you don't ever want to be here close to 7 because some pretty bad stuff that happens when you get there. So the debate is really between 8.5% and 9% ongoing more stable environment position in my view. And so as things stabilize, I will be recommending to the Board, if we consider a lower target capital level and based on the work that Daryl and his team does we'll come up with whatever the number looks like, but we are not going to be rushed and I want to be fair to our shareholders, there is opportunity here, but we're going to be conservative and I won\u2019t \u2013 mark to understand that and mark over-promise and well over deliver Matt O\u2019Connor: That's helpful. And then just separately any early signs of, call it, either client attrition or clients taking a wait-and-see approach from doing business with you, and I know you can't talk to SunTrust. But is there any kind of wait-and-see or on the flipside, are there discussions with clients saying, Hey, now that you're going to be a lot bigger, can you do more for us, whether it's, say, taking bigger positions in lending or you've got a broader product set so as more we can do with you there. Talk about those kind of puts and takes if you're seeing any so far? Thank you. Kelly King : Yes, so it's a very good question, and you're right. We have limited insight into that because we've been very, very clear to our people. We are ROA competitors today as we have since day one. And we're not going to walk anywhere close to that line item of not being competitive, and so, therefore, we have very limited information. We do pickup little bits of anecdotal feedback. And certainly, there are clients that are out there talking about, hey, it's going to be great when you guys get together, you will have more expanded lending capacity, you have more products and services, if they were BB&T or SunTrust Advisory, they would both say the same thing, which is true. And so I think everybody recognizes the opportunity out there by us combining  In terms of any attrition materially, but I've heard when you go to BB&T side, there is \u2013 has not been. I notice there's been lot of conversation out in the market about everybody's saying they're taking all of our business, that's not true, you just saw our growth numbers, we grew alone 6.5% and our deposits grew 5%. So \u2013 I don't know how to be clear than that. There is a not any immaterial attrition. Our turnover rate is about the same or lower than it has been. So I would say to you that this is extraordinarily successful to this point. There is no indication of any decay and there's no expectation of any decay rather the expectation is a rather positive optimistic opportunity as we come together. Daryl Bible : Hey, John, could you take our next caller please. Operator : Yes, Sir. We will now move on to our next question from Michael Rose of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Michael Rose : Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Just going back to the merger, I think when you guys announced this you talked about $2 billion in one-time charges, just wanted to see if there are any adjustments to that and any adjustments to the time line. I think you talked about a conversion somewhere 12 to 18 months after close. And should we expect the majority of the one-time cost to come around at that timeframe? Thanks. Daryl Bible : So, Michael it's Daryl. So the numbers are still coming together. So year-to-date between BB&T and SunTrust, if you look at our charges today, we're about $250 million between marks and MOE-related expenses. We got some more information on the IT convergence, that's getting finalized, that's going to be a very large number. So I don't have all the number in yet, but I'm pretty sure that we are going to probably utilize the bulk of the $2 billion. We'll give you more color as we close because we still don't have all the information that we really need between each of ourselves until we close the transaction. But what I'm seeing right now and there is a very complicated integration, as Kelly talked about, hooking these computers together is going to take some a lot of need for outside assistance to help with that all come together. So I would say, it's going to be the bulk of the $2 billion from what we are seeing right now, but we'll give a better information. First, our timing goes, we're trying to get majority of all the systems put together by the end of 2021, if that's possible. We will do the \u2013 the teams are working really hard to work out those plans and feel very comfortable that, that can be done in the timeframe, but we'll give you more specifics as we get more clarity, probably over the next couple of months but things are coming in as expected. And I think you're going to have a really robust combination of IT systems when it's all set and done. Michael Rose : Okay, that's a great color. And maybe just as a follow-up, now you've had some time to the kind of dig into their side, can you just explain where you think the greatest opportunities could be for revenue synergies and maybe what areas you're working on as you prepare for the close? Thanks. Chris Henson : Yes. Mike, this is Chris. Bill and I have been working together, as Kelly alluded to earlier, on a number of fronts. I would just maybe hit the highlights, certainly they have a much more build-out capital markets business to bring strategic advice sort of down segment, if you will. We have a very strong Community Bank that from, I'll call it, revenue companies down to $25 million that need those types of services, many of which we did not offer prior. So we see a great opportunity to bring strategic value to those commercial clients on many, many fronts from a paid perspective to really build out there their overall needs and planning for their future. The flip of that would be, so that's a big one, the flip of that would be, we have a substantial insurance business, I think, of the best-in-class insurance business. There is really not much we don't offer that we can take to their entire commercial business, up and down, small business, all the way up to the largest corporate clients they handle. We also have the largest life insurance distributor in the country with Crump Life, that we have built a business within our Company of offering to our clients. We will extend that naturally to the SunTrust clients on both the commercial and the individual side. As you think about the connectivity with wealth and the broker-dealer and the strong wealth business they have, the state planning need to fund their sales plans, plus their agreements that kind of thing, we have a tremendous opportunity to offer life into the wealth business and also into key man insurance on the commercial side, so tremendous opportunity there. Third, that's kind of common sense is, we have a very strong business. We call it BB&T work. We provide sort of turnkey deposit programs to our commercial clients for their employees. SunTrust has a plan. It has not been as effective and its one thing that we think we can turn on day one to help grow deposits in that sector, that's just a handful of three that I think have potential, but we have got another 15 to 18 behind that, that maybe begin of kind of all sizes and shapes that were not modeled as MOE. We're very very excited about. Michael Rose : That's great color. Thanks for, taking my questions. Daryl Bible : Sure. Operator : We will now move on to our final question from Stephen Scouten of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead, your line is open. Stephen Scouten : Hey, good morning everyone. Daryl Bible : Good morning. Stephen Scouten : I was curious, how you guys are thinking about the move to Charlotte and kind of protecting the legacy brands in the standings, that you guys haven't Winston-Salem, for BB&T. And obviously, Atlanta for SunTrust and particularly as that pertains to Atlanta and continues to grow and look like kind of capital. The Southeast and how you think about protecting that as you moved the headquarters to Charlotte and not letting somebody else kind of take that position over time. Kelly King : So Stephen, we are very excited about the move for all three markets, Charlotte Atlanta and Winston-Salem. Charlotte is a super dynamic market. I mean it's going extremely fast. Its got to be real kind of a major focus for young professionals to be attract and a lot of technology people there, a lot of technology companies there, auto companies moving their technology operations there. When this merger is done, Charlotte is the second largest financial district in the country. And so, Charlotte is going to be a mega place for us to do business. But Atlanta is fantastic as well. Atlanta you could say is clearly the dominant city in the Southeast. It's a fantastic place. We love Atlanta and we will continue to love Atlanta. This is not -- we're not moving out of Atlanta. We will have a superstar later in Atlanta from SunTrust, who is one of the most accomplished bankers in the country today and she is extraordinarily plugged in. We won't miss a beat in Atlanta. Our commitment will be increased in terms of our community support, our commitment in terms of marketing and execution will be increased. We would expect our execution of business attraction in Atlanta to be greater going forward then has been in the past and keep in mind that you know our commitment was and is that we will have domiciled our headquarters for capital markets, investment banking, wealth management and Atlanta. Likewise in Winston-Salem, our Retail Community Bank will be headquartered in Winston-Salem Triad area. And so, neither market loses. It's just that we happen to be blessed by having three fantastic markets that are now, they're kind of the foundational anchor geographical locations are Truist. So don't think about it as Truist being anchored to Charlotte, think about the Truist being anchor two to three. And we still have a toehold end markets that we generated from in Wilson, North Carolina and Orlando. So we are a community bank. We don't think in terms of one market driving everything. We think of it being a coalition of a group of community banks coming together under the advantages of holding company. So, nobody loses, everybody wins. Stephen Scouten : Perfect. Helpful. And then maybe just one follow-up, you spoke to kind of seeing long-term strength in the economy and obviously your growth remains solid, ex the mortgage sale, but we've seen some mixed economic numbers manufacturing, et cetera. Can you talk a little bit about, what you're seeing from your customer base in terms of incremental investment in overall market demand? Thanks. Daryl Bible : Yes, I'll make a comment. Then I'll let Clarke to make a comment. The feedback that I get primarily from our Regional Presidents, but also talking directly to class when I'm traveling around, you know for 10 years of MainStreet America really kind of suffered as the biggest companies were doing more robust international business and MainStreet were still recovering from the recession. But MainStreet has recovered from the recession and after 10 years now at investing MainStreet is now needing to invest, learning to invest and they are investing. So MainStreet is kind of a broad-based business activity that we see across to the right of our business activities and of course, we don't participate as much and a larger global international businesses, so as they are seeing more of the impact of the trade war is not, that's not impacting us as much as we, some of the mega banks. So I'll say, earlier it was if we are still here, we are beginning to hear some conversation from our local MainStreet clients, around uncertainties, around trade wars because after while it drift down MainStreet and everybody talks about it, if that persist for a long time, it will affect MainStreet, but it's not having a material impact today. Clarke, any color on that. Clarke Starnes : Yes, I would just echo what Kelly is saying that while there is more conversation about the headline news and you might be some more cautious tone in some conversations are, our opportunities continue to be very robust across the Board. We have good pipelines. Really I think one of the benefits that Kelly brought out earlier is just the diversification in the various platforms we have. So while there is more conversation, I'd say it's more on the higher end than it is at this point on Main Street or the retail side, but people are conscious and thinking about it and we're trying to respond appropriately, but we still think there's plenty of opportunities with all the different levers that we have to pull. Stephen Scouten : Great, thank you guys so much. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the conference back to Mr. Rich Baytosh for any additional or closing\u2026 Rich Baytosh : Okay. Thank you, John and thank you everyone for joining us. I apologize to those we have time to get through today and we will call you later. And I hope everyone has a good day. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Rich Baytosh, Director of Investor Relations for Truist Financial Corporation. Rich Baytosh : Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. Thanks to all of our listeners for joining us today. On today's call, we have Kelly King, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Daryl Bible, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review the results for the fourth quarter and provide some thoughts for the first quarter and full year 2020.

And now I'll turn it over to Kelly. Kelly King : Thanks, Rich. Good morning everybody and thank you for joining our first Truist earnings call. Thank you for your support. What you're going to see is overall a fantastic progress in one year. And I would say to you generally if you liked our company a year ago, you should love us now. As we go through this information, we're going to be completely transparent. But as you would expect it's going to be messy. We don't know all that you want to know, but our pledge to you is that over the next quarter or two we\u2019ll give you more and more as we go along. Some of the highlights, which you probably already know but we did successfully closed the deal on December 6. This is interestingly the largest financial transaction -- institution transaction in 15 years. And these two iconic companies have 275-plus combined years of service, which is huge. We are the sixth largest U.S. commercial bank. We have the number two weighted average deposit market share on our top 20 MSAs and about $473 billion in assets. I think very, very importantly before legal day one, which was less than 60 days ago we had all managers in place and our organizational structure today is set and running. No confusion about who's doing what. So that's a really, really big deal. We've done a lot of work with regard to our culture. I'll talk about that in a moment, but I feel really, really good. And we've made much progress in other areas. I want to spend just a minute on culture, because this is the most important consideration for all of us. Culture drives long-term performance. There is no question about that. And therefore it is our number one priority. The way we think about culture is a culture is a function of our purpose, our mission and our values. There are certain practices the, kind of, way we do things around here and there's a whole process of embedding the culture into the organization. But the most important thing to think about is our purpose, our mission and our values. Our purpose at Truist is to inspire and build better lives and communities. We really believe we can make the world better and we think that is exactly what major corporations are called upon to do today. We execute our purpose through our mission, which is focusing on taking care of our clients through a really good environment for our teammates and of course optimizing long-term value for all of our stakeholders. Most importantly all of our mission efforts are guided by our long-standing deep beliefs, which we call values. Our values at Truist are about being trustworthy. We serve with integrity. It's about being caring. We know that everyone and every moment matters. It's about one team coming together. We can accomplish anything working together as a team. It's about success. We know that when our clients win, we all win. And for our teammates it's about happiness. Essentially positive energy changes lives and we ultimately want all of our teammates to be happy because when you're happy, you don't have a job you have a passion and we want everybody to be passionately focused on accomplishing our purpose. We know that we are very, very closely aligned. Early on in this process, we got really good research from our 59,000 teammates. We -- for example early on we gave them 16 words to describe their companies. We got over 10,000 responses from each side. They all picked exactly the same four words. A couple months later, we had scientific research where we asked again over 20,000 teammates divided between the companies to describe the company in terms of how we operate. And they described it almost exactly the same. Just a week before last, we started a series of 39 town halls where Bill Rogers and I went around and started talking to our teammates and answering questions. Week before last, we did 11 of 39. Next week we will do another 11 as well. And I would tell you that the responses are fantastic. Our teammates are excited. They love our culture. They love our purpose. They love our brand. They love our colors. They love our logo. So, it is off to a really, really good start. But I want you to feel confident as investors that this is not two companies struggling trying to come together. This is two companies that were already deeply aligned in terms of our purpose, our mission and our values. Everything we've seen over the last year affirms just that. And now, there's a renewed level of excitement from everybody as we think about coming together as Truist and going out and making the world a better place. Let's talk about some of the highlights. If you're following along on page 6, total taxable-equivalent revenue was $3.6 billion. Adjusted net income available to common shareholders was $1.46 billion and that's up 29%. But like all these numbers, you're going to know that they're obviously inflated because of the SunTrust impact on the BB&T numbers as we added 25 days towards the end of the fourth quarter. So, we won't dwell so much on the specific changes, but we did make over $1 billion. In terms of diluted earnings per share, adjusted is the dollar square [ph] give you some detail in terms of how that adjustment was arrived at. Return on average assets adjusted 1.4%, very strong. Return on average tangible common equity 18.6%, which right out of the shoot is really, really good again on adjusted basis. And adjusted efficiency ratio was 57.5%. Both companies to give you a sense of momentum grew loans at a healthy pace when you ex out from restructuring which Daryl will talk about. But underlying growth is very good. The pipelines are very strong. And we feel very, very good about momentum. Asset quality is great. And we've taken some actions to optimize the portfolio from a credit perspective. Our capital and liquidity levels are excellent. Daryl will give you detail about that. Our businesses, as I said have good momentum. We talked to bankers all across the footprint. Pipelines are strong. People are excited about doing business with Truist. The launching of the Truist brand, colors, logo could not have gone better. But I want you to know that we are primarily focused on serving our clients. We are laser-focused on making sure our clients have a distinctive, outstanding service quality relationship with Truist. We're going to talk about cost saves and Daryl will give you a lot of detail that we have available for that. But I want you to know from our perspective; we have made a decision to slow the timing down just a few months. And we did that to improve client service quality, to ensure strong client retention, to improve the long-term value proposition. This is about really the digital investments that we're going to be making. We want to get some of those made before we actually roll out the conversion and so the branch conversions are delayed some. Part of that was because of the agreement, we reached with regulators. Part of that was because we wanted to delay it to make sure again, we have a digital value proposition in place. Still we are very, very confident on our net $1.6 billion in savings. So, this should not be viewed as a negative. This is a positive. It's the same number. We've simply taken just a little bit longer to make sure we do it and do it right. Our nonperforming assets were fantastic at 0.14%. Net charge-offs were right in the sweet spot of what we've always indicated 0.40% and a very strong common equity Tier one capital of 9.4%. So, we feel really, really good about asset quality and capital. If you look at page 7, I'll just mention these selected items really just three that are large. The merger-related restructuring charges $223 million pretax, which is $0.19 negative impact on diluted EPS. We had security losses because of our balance sheet restructuring. That was $116 million, which translates into about $0.10 in terms of negative impact on EPS. And then, we have some expenses that are not technically from an accounting point of view designated as merger related, but they are incremental operating expenses that do have future benefits, but they're not part of our ongoing run rate. So, you can kind of think about them the same. The main thing is they don't impact future run rate. So when you add all that together, you get a net negative impact on our ongoing run rate of $0.37, which is substantially why you see the difference in GAAP and our adjusted numbers. If you look at page 8 just a few comments with regard to loans. We did have an end-of-period balance of about $300 billion really good mix. The mix of loans held for investment consists of 56% commercial, 40% consumer, about 2% credit card pretty balanced. Over time, you might expect to see the consumer grow a little faster than commercial if you get a little closer to 50-50, but we feel really good about where we are starting out. We did take some actions, which Daryl will give you more color on with regard to the portfolios. But I would just point out that the year-end portfolio loans are a little inflated by about $4.5 billion because of the loans that have moved into loans held for sale and moved but haven't closed it. So we'll close very, very soon. So as we think about the overall market just in talking to an awful lot of our Regional Presidents and Market Presidents; I would say that, overall market is pretty good. CEOs are confident in their businesses. But it's fair to say they are nervous. They're worried about the macro issues, the trade war, Iran, the coronavirus. We have 10-plus years long into recovery. So while we do not expect a recession in the near-term, I would say in fairness we can certainly talk ourselves into one. So it's a little bit of a nervous period right now. I think we need to be honest about that. But that's one of the reasons that Truist always remains strong in terms of capital and liquidity in the event these existential factors do create an interruption in terms of ongoing business. But we don't really predict one now. We really think this will settle down. We certainly hope and pray that this coronavirus does not get out of hand, but we all have to be really concerned about that. There are a lot of people around the world being hurt a lot -- people are dying and we got to really hope that that does not become a global systemic issue. And I personally don't think it will, but we have to pay a lot of close attention to that. If you're looking at slides on Page 9 just a couple of comments with regard to deposits. We did end up with non-interest-bearing deposits of about $92 billion and total deposits of about $335 billion. The -- if you exclude purchase accounting non-interest deposits declined, just a little bit in the third quarter. Everybody I believe is seeing a continued shift out of non-interest into time and we're seeing the same thing. It's not indifferent than anybody else is facing. But our interest deposits did increase a strong 9%. So you can see what's going on. Our total deposit activity is very good. It's just a little shift going on. We have strong non-interest deposits that total 30.6%, one of the best in the industry. So we feel good about that. Our total cost of average total deposits and average interest-bearing deposits respectively decreased 10 basis points and 17. So actually pretty good there given the relatively flat yield curve. We're very happy to report that we are telegraphing to our clients that virtually all of our clients will not experience any change in their account numbers. Having been involved in lots and lots of mergers over my career, I can tell you that the big issue for the client is change. And the main thing about change is don't change my account number. So we've worked out a way and I congratulate our people for virtually all of our clients not to have any changes in their account numbers. So we predict that it will go extraordinarily smoothly for our clients, which is certainly our goal. So overall even though it's a little hard to see through the numbers, our balance sheet is strong, strong earnings tremendous progress in moving Truist forward and we are very excited and we're very confident. With that let me turn it to Daryl who will give you a lot more detail and a lot more color. Daryl Bible : Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 10, net interest income was $2.25 billion. Net interest margin was 3.41%, up 4 basis points versus the third quarter. Purchase accounting contributed 27 basis points to reported net interest margin. At the end of the year, our final purchase accounting marks included $4.5 billion against the SunTrust loan portfolio, an $83 million upward adjustment to CDs and a $309 million upward adjustment to long-term debt. These marks were close to the recent estimates that we provided based upon September 30 data. We plan to true-up these marks in the first quarter as the final valuation numbers come in from our third-party provider. Core net interest margin was 3.14% down 15 basis points from the third quarter. The yield on loans held for investment decreased 6 basis points as the effect of lower short-term rates was partially offset by a 37 basis point benefit from purchase accounting. The balance sheet restructuring improved our securities yield by 5 basis points and achieved our goal of a relatively neutral interest rate risk profile. Continuing on slide 11, this summarizes our balance sheet restructuring which is focused on improving credit quality, liquidity, interest rate sensitivity, net interest margin and return on capital. Through the restructuring, we improved the run rate on the investment portfolio, built liquidity to meet our LCR requirements re-hedged the balance sheet and managed towards a more neutral interest rate position. We sold loans to manage negative convexity, reduced premium amortization and enhanced credit quality by exiting $1.4 billion of high-risk credit exposures of which $516 million was funded at year-end. About 80% of that sale traded in January. Through the end of January, we lowered interest rates on about $17 billion of institutional deposits by 20 basis points because of our higher credit ratings. We will continue to be opportunistic in optimizing other funding to take advantage of Truist's higher credit ratings. We also estimate that year-end loans held for sale were elevated relative to normalized levels by approximately $4.5 billion and that the securities were elevated by approximately $1.4 billion. This means the balance sheet should settle slightly under $470 billion in total assets. Turning to slide 12. Non-interest income increased $233 million after excluding $116 million in security losses and $22 million in losses related to the transfer of residential mortgages held for sale. Approximately $217 million [ph] of the increase was due to the merger. The rest was due to a $22 million increase in insurance income due to seasonality and minor changes in heritage BB&T fee income categories. Of note, full year 2019 insurance income had organic growth of 8.8%. Continuing on slide 13. Non-interest expense was up $497 million after excluding a $189 million increase in merger and restructuring charges and $49 million increase in incremental operating expenses related to the merger. Approximately $400 million of this was due to core expenses from the merger. The remaining increase was due to $42 million in heritage BB&T incentives and $42 million in amortization due to higher CDI and other intangibles. Turning to slide 14. Asset quality remains strong. NPAs increased $175 million to $684 million. The increase was due to the merger and included $107 million of acquired non-performing loans held for sale, $63 million of loans and leases held for investment and $63 million of foreclosed real estate partially offset by the sale of $69 million of non-performing mortgages. NPLs were 15 basis points of total loans held for investment at the end of the year, down from 30 basis points at September 30. The decrease in the ratio was mostly due to the effect of accounting for acquired NPLs on a pooled basis in PCI. This effect on the ratio will reverse with the adoption of CECL and the transition of pooled level accounting for PCI. Net charge-offs increased $39 million and were 40 basis points of average loans, down one basis point from last quarter. The provision increased $54 million due to higher net charge-offs and an increase in the provision for unfunded commitments. Our allowance was 52 basis points of loans held for investment at year-end, down from 105 at September 30, due to the elimination of the SunTrust allowance. We would note that the combination of our allowance and unamortized fair value mark is a very robust 2.01% of total loans. The allowance coverage ratios also remained strong at 2.03 times net charge-offs and 3.41 times NPLs. Continuing on slide 15. Effective January 1 Truist adopted CECL, the new accounting standard related to credit losses. As a result, this did not impact our 2019 financial results. However, the impact at adoption was an overall $2.9 billion increase in the allowance for credit losses. The magnitude of this increase was significantly impacted by purchase accounting related to the merger. We were not required to carry allowance on the acquired loans from the transaction at year-end, due to the related purchase accounting marks. Excluding the impact of purchase accounting, the implementation of CECL resulted in an approximate 40% increase in the allowance for credit losses. This reflects increases that are related to our consumer and mortgage portfolios, partially offset by the decrease in our commercial loan portfolio. In terms of capital, the increase in the allowance due to CECL resulted in a $2.1 billion after-tax reduction to retained earnings. Truist has elected to phase in the impact to regulatory capital by 25% annually from 2020 through 2023. Turning to slide 16. Our capital ratios decreased due to the merger, but remained strong relative to regulatory capital levels for well-capitalized banks. Our CET1 ratio was 9.4% down from 10.6% in the third quarter. The benefits of purchase accounting will be partially offset in the first quarter by a 10 basis point impact from the treatment of MSR risk-weighted assets under the simplification rule and a 14 basis point impact from the CECL phase-in. At December 31, tangible book value per share increased 5.2% from September 30. Earnings during the quarter contributed 3.4% of the increase. And the merger with SunTrust contributed 1.8% confirming the close was accretable to tangible common equity. Compared to December 31, 2018 tangible book per share increased 18.5%. Continuing to slide 17. We realized 2020 may be challenging to analyze and model. So we are providing more guidance than usual. Our guidance is largely dollar-based due to the absence of historical baselines to which growth rates can be applied. Some highlights from our first quarter 2020 guidance includes average earning assets to be plus or minus $406 billion. We expect reported net interest margin to be in the mid to high 3.40s and core margin to be just over 3%. Net charge-offs should range from 35 to 50 basis points and fee income should be just over $2 billion. Our expense guidance includes $100 million to $150 million in merger expenses. For the full year, we expect the balance sheet to grow based upon our guidance. Net charge-offs should remain relatively stable assuming no significant deterioration in the economy. And expenses will trend down each quarter until we achieve an annual run rate expense savings of about $480 million in the fourth quarter. Turning to slide 18, we are also providing medium term performance target for about three years. We are confident Truist can generate peer-leading, return on tangible common equity in the low 20s, and an adjusted efficiency ratio in the low 50s over the medium term. In terms of capital, we are targeting 10% CET1 ratio for 2020. We are also confident we will achieve $1.6 billion in net expense savings through 2022. But we are updating the expected timing of our expense net savings. This is primarily due to our commitment to the regulators not to close overlapping branches for the -- at least the first year and careful and cautious approach to systems integration to minimize client disruption. By the end of 2020, we expect to achieve a run rate equal to 30% of our net cost savings target by the end of 2021, 65% and by the end of 2022, a full $1.6 billion. All of this will drive positive operating leverage for the next three years. For reference, 2019 combined non-interest expense excluding merger expenses, a one-time charitable contribution, and amortization was approximately $1.8 billion. We expect to achieve an annual run rate of investment of approximately $200 million by the fourth quarter of 2020. These investments will be directed towards personnel, branding, digital, and technology. Now, let me turn it back to Kelly for an update on the merger and closing thoughts and Q&A. Kelly King : Thanks Daryl. So, if you'll take a look at Page 19 just to summarize. Just a lot of really, really good accomplishments so far. Once we closed the deal, we've integrated a financial reporting system. We've integrated and converted derivatives Workday a number of other systems. We have successfully retained our talent and our clients. So, any concern about any mass exits on that is not warranted. We've restructured the balance sheet. We've launched our visual imagery colors and logo. We've introduced our culture of purpose mission and values. And I'm happy to say we've added some key leadership in certain areas particularly in the digital space. So, kind of, what's coming up in a big picture perspective is that we are now working hard on completing product mapping which allows us then to go into the development. We will be continuing to complete another 28 town halls. We'll be doing about 12 next week. So, that continues on. We will continue to focus on deepening our relationship with our clients. We will complete the branch divestitures in a few months. We will complete the purchase of our new Truist and our headquarters here in Charlotte. I just mentioned that because that's a pretty big deal in this market and for our people. Our people are really excited about being in a 47-story iconic building that shows well in Charlotte. We'll be introducing and marketing our Truist brand and we'll continue investments in digital and technology. And then we'll phase into the conversion of the primary systems. So, overall, it was a very strong quarter. As we've said a year ago, we have two great companies coming together to create a very special company. We are in great markets, we have great economics, we have a very strong culture. Everyone is excited about our purpose. We have the opportunity to make the world a better place. You got to love Truist. So, I'll turn it back over to Rich. Rich Baytosh : Thank you, Kelly. Lauren at this time if you would come back on the line and explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Kelly. Good morning, Bill. Kelly King : Hi, good morning, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Kelly and Bill congratulations on doing a monumental dealing and coming out of the gates with some really good numbers. Congratulations. Bill Rogers : Thank you. Kelly King : Thank you. We appreciate that. Gerard Cassidy : Daryl can you share with us on the credit side the provision for the guidance for 2020 seems pretty robust. Did CECL have an impact on what you guys are looking for? Because considering that you mark-to-market all those loans at the time of closing without CECL I would have maybe expected the provision maybe to be a little lower. Daryl Bible : Yes Gerard. So, we basically adopted FASB's guidance on how CECL operate. Our auditors PwC feels very comfortable with what we booked on 1/1 of 2020. In essence, if you back out the purchase accounting it's a 40% increase of the two banks combined. We were both around 105 or 106 allowance. We're up to about 147. If you add in reserve for unfunded it's about 161. But that's what the guidance basically told us to do and that's why we booked that. I do agree though there is a double dip in there. I mean that is definitely positive because we have purchase accounting marks of $4.5 billion on the SunTrust loan portfolio. And now we have a reserve 147 on the loan book as well. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then Kelly and Bill when you guys -- on slide 19 you listed your accomplishments so far and now the next steps. Can you share with us how challenged are the -- is the heaviest listening ahead of us? Or has it already been accomplished? Can you compare and contrast what you've already accomplished with what you still need to do in terms of the degree of difficulty? Kelly King : Good question, Gerard. I'll take a start and then Bill can add to that. I would say in all honesty the heaviest listening is done because pulling two companies together early on to make sure that you don't have any cultural interruption that you don't have any \u2013 excuse me, clashes in business strategies that you still feel confident in terms of achieving the expense saves all of those are -- we feel better today than we felt a year ago. I have to say for myself and I think Bill will echo this. You know, week before last when we visited 11 town halls we touched about 6,000 teammates. And if you'd have been in that room number one you would have said these people have been working together for 25 years. And number two, you would have thought the level of excitement was just extraordinarily high. And so that's work that's got to be done with regard to programming and I don't take anything away from that. There's really, really hard work. But at this point the organization is settled strong focused and we are just now focusing on doing the connectivity work that is big but is predictable in terms of how well we can do it. Bill? Bill Rogers : Yes. I think, Kelly and I looked at this through the same lens in terms of what's hard and what's easy. And the hard part and the most important part is getting the cultural alignment and making sure that's fair. And I think Kelly has articulated that really well and I feel the exact same way. And if that wasn't there then that would be some concern and that would make the road ahead hard. So I think we've set a really good foundation for the road ahead. That's not to diminish the fact we have a lot of work. So we've got a lot of systems integration to do and revenue synergies to achieve and all those things. But what I think we would align on is the highest hurdle is, is it working and is the company culture aligned and are we leaning forward and I feel great about that. Gerard Cassidy : Again, thank you and congratulations. Bill Rogers : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Saul Martinez with UBS. Saul Martinez : Hey. Good morning, everybody. Congratulations on your first quarter as a combined entity. A couple of questions. First on your marks in the outlook for purchase accounting accretion. I think the mark is about $4.5 billion not too different from in your last filing. Daryl, can you just walk us through whether that calculation has changed at all with regards to how much of it's credit liquidity and rate marks? And the purchase accounting accretion trajectory as well. If you can talk to that because I think this -- your guidance implies about I think $1.6 billion of purchase accounting accretion this year. How does that go -- how does that move forward also beyond 2020? How do we think about the glide path of PAA and how it impacts numbers beyond this year? Daryl Bible : Thank you for the question, Saul. So first, I would tell you that the $4.5 billion that was booked that we're showing from December 6 that we remarked about 60% of it is credit-related 1.8%. It came down a little bit. But it's really closely aligned to -- I mean our CECL with reserve for unfunded was in the 160s, low 160s. So it's just a little bit more than that obviously, due for a little bit different methodologies but it's very consistent from that impact. The other part the other 40% is mainly attributable to liquidity and interest rate risk. We did put in one of the slides that the commercial portfolio probably has an average life of around three years consumer around 6. I would say it's going to ebb and flow of how contractual payments come through as well as prepayments. You will definitely see a downward trajectory on the purchase accounting accretion that's coming through. But at the same time what you're going to see is our cost savings our net cost savings really kick in and over that same time period. And you would actually still see improvement on a consistent basis on our operating leverage number just because of the calculation of how efficiency works with expenses over revenue. For every dollar we save it's worth $2 of revenue that's lost. So we still feel very good about the projections that we gained from that perspective. Saul Martinez : Okay, got it. And I guess a follow-up there. You're -- adjusting for purchase accounting accretion. The guidance implies about -- by my calculation, about $12.2 billion to $12.5 billion of net interest income ex-ing out PAA. If I look at the combined entity historically SunTrust BB&T, the run rate's been about $13 billion. Can you just walk us through what's driving that difference? I know, there's a lot of balance sheet restructuring going on, but it does seem to imply that the core NII -- there's some degradation there, ex-ing out the PAA. Is my understanding this right? Can you just walk me through like what's driving that? Daryl Bible : Yes. I mean, if you really look at the balance sheet restructuring, we didn't shrink that much. I mean, the mark was $4.5 billion. So the loans didn't sell. We just basically wrote down the loans. We did sell mortgages. Mortgages, if you look at it over the last couple quarters, is down about $10 billion. But pretty much everything else is consistent. The big reason why NII is down -- if you go back a year ago and you look at, like, what we were projecting, our models and all of our peers models had interest rates still rising at the start of 2019. And if -- we actually went back and did a little homework. We looked at what estimates were back then and we compared them to what estimates are right now. And across the board, the peer average is down 20 to 25 basis points. And that's just because of the lower rate environment and the flatter curve that you're seeing. Saul Martinez : Okay. So it's really just the rate backdrop has degradated NII? Daryl Bible : Correct. Saul Martinez : All right. Okay. I guess I get that. But like, even if I look at the third quarter, Daryl, combined NII pro forma was about $3.25 billion or $13 billion annualized. So this quarter, I guess, there's some degradation there, but it seems like a pretty big drop off. Daryl Bible : You had margins in the second half of 2019 really start to hit as the rate cuts came in. They occurred in July and you had three drops. So you really aren't seeing the full impact. The last drop was in December. So you aren't getting to see full impact until you get to the first quarter. So you have to look at that trajectory that we've seen over the last six months. Saul Martinez : Okay. All right. Fair enough. Thanks a lot. Operator : We'll take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. Thanks for the update on some of the kind of planned milestones that we should be focusing on, on page 19. But, I guess, I want to focus on just the systems conversions and what are the big ones that we should be thinking about that will drive the cost saves. And it seems like banks have done a pretty good job converting various systems and recent deals, but it can always be sort of a risk. So what's the time frame for some of the bigger system conversions? And, I guess, just what should we be looking for to make sure they go well? Kelly King : So, Matt, the -- clearly the biggest is the overall deposit conversion, because that's what drives the interaction with the clients. Loan conversion is a big deal, obviously. I would say those are the two larger ones. There are -- we have about 3,000 programs that have to be dealt with 100 ecosystem, so there's a lot of them. But it's like any other bank; the primary is loans and deposits. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And the timing of those conversions? Kelly King : Sorry? Daryl Bible : Timing of the conversions. Matt O'Connor: Timing. Kelly King : Timing. So we will be primarily shooting for about August of 2021. That may seem like a long time, but we're committed to doing it right. Much work is already underway in terms of ecosystem selection that's virtually all done. We are moving into programming now. The programming takes several months. Then you have a huge amount of time of tests. But you can do it sooner and we could beat that a little bit. But the key is to take plenty of time for testing, because you only know through testing if you've done it right. And you don't want to put it out there and then go back and have to change it. So if I had to give you a specific date now, I'd give you like August of 2021. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then separately, Daryl, if you look at, I guess, on slide 17, here the outlook for the first quarter and the full year implies relatively stable earning assets throughout the year. And I mean, it sounds like there's some kind of inflated assets at year-end in held for sale and the securities book that presumably will run off, I would think, relatively quick. So what I'm getting at is I'm trying to think about the loan growth that you're assuming for the rest of the year? Or maybe I'm wrong with those kind of inflated assets run off in the first quarter? Daryl Bible : Yes. So, Matt, what I would say is, I mean, the trajectory of loans coming off the books, mainly mortgages, was down third, fourth quarter. And we've bottomed out. Most of the trades have settled down. Just a little bit left to go this quarter. But when you look at point-to-point, when we presented to our Board earlier this week, our operating plan on a go-forward basis, we're looking to be a little bit better than growth in GDP. So I would say in the 2% to 3% range point-to-point in loans over the next year and favored a little bit heavier in commercial versus retail. But I think we have as Kelly said momentum that we finished with the year fourth quarter. And the teams are working really well together and feel very positive that we're going to grow and generate revenue as we move forward in 2020. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Good morning. Kelly King : Good morning. Daryl Bible : Good morning. John Pancari : On the slowing of the timing of the cost saves of the factors that you said what was the biggest driver? Because I just assume a lot of the drivers that you said like focusing on service quality, the customer retention, the digital that's stuff that you would have already assumed that you would have been doing. So what was the change? What surprised you to make that change? Thanks. Kelly King : So, John, it was not really a surprise, but it is a difference. We were very committed to picking the best of the systems. And so we went system by system to look at the best. And we picked a number of SunTrust systems, which are really, really good as surviving Truist systems. So it's a little technical. But if you took all of the BB&T systems, you can convert this much faster. You just move all of the data from SunTrust over to BB&T systems -- programs. But when you pick the SunTrust system and you put it on the BB&T equipment, you have equipment changes and you have the programming to move that SunTrust program over to the BB&T systems. That's really what's driving the time a bit longer than we thought. But it's also a conservative estimate with regard to testing because we are committed to do an awful lot of testing. And then remember when we first talked about our timing, we did not anticipate the branch delay, which you alluded to that, but that is a year of delayed savings. It was the right thing to do in conjunction with approval of the process. We feel good about it. We will be doing closings during the course of the year in non-overlapping markets. We will be doing a lot of work through our retail channel in terms of preparing for the closings. But that's a pretty material change in terms of the timing of the cost saves. John Pancari : Okay. That's helpful, Kelly. Thanks. And then separately back to your 2020 outlook on slide 17, it looks like the share count outlook isn't showing a change. So is that implying that you're not assuming buybacks in 2020? And if so, could you give us the rationale for that? Daryl Bible : We basically said when we announced the merger, we're going to run at a 10% CET1 ratio until we got through some of the integrations and took some of the risk off the table. So we are starting off targeting 10%. When we do our CCAR ask -- our CCAR ask that will be coming up in the next couple of months, we will build in capacity such that if we decide to change that and decide to target something less than that after we have some success we'll have the ability to do that. But right now, we're sticking to 10%. John Pancari : Okay. Got it. All right. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi. Well the delay in the branch closing is not really new. I guess you just updated the numbers, because you said that almost six months ago. So I'm just trying to understand better the outlook for expenses. So you look to take the efficiency ratio from 57.5% down to what like 53% or 54% over three years. That implies a lot of positive operating leverage. So I guess the real question is, do you expect positive operating leverage in 2020? And as part of that, I mean if you're delaying some of the branch closures and the deposit and loan conversions aren't until August 2021, what are the expense savings that you can get more in the near term such as back-office or anything else? Thanks. Kelly King : So we will -- we are expecting positive operating leverage really for the next three years. So that's a really, really good story. There are a lot of savings that we will get. Remember again, the overlapping branches closings are deferred. There are a number of branch closings that are not in overlapping areas that are going to be closed in the near term. In addition to that just because we don't close certain branches and overlapping, doesn't mean we don't reduce expenses in those areas. Some of these branches are literally side by side. And there are commonalities in terms of staffing that we can integrate even though they are two separate branches. And so there will be cost saves in the branches even before the branches actually are closed. So there are a lot of areas -- to be honest there's still a lot of backroom areas that are not related to the branches that we have overlapping staffing. We didn't deal with all of that day one. As time goes on, we will have additional overlapping redundancy in staffing that we will be reducing. So it's kind of a hodgepodge to be honest. But it's pretty clear to see what we've laid out. We think with this modification in terms of the expected timeframe with regard to saves, we feel very, very confident we'll be able to accomplish that. Daryl Bible : Mike, if you look on page 13 on the non-interest expense space that we have the first five categories that you have there personnel all the way down to equipment expense, I would expect those expense items to decrease over the next three years. This year personnel will drop. We did went through our first RIF more in the management level, when we closed the transaction. Our sourcing group is working aggressively with our third-party vendor supplier. So we will get savings in those areas. And while we got a lot of branches to-date won't close this year we're working very aggressively in all the major markets in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast to really focus and consolidate our buildings in all the metropolitan areas and that should come online middle to end of 2020. So we feel very good that we're going to get the cost savings in 2020 and in the next three years. Mike Mayo : And so just maybe don't want to answer the question you're not giving that guidance. So when we look at the year 2020 shared revenue growth exceed expense growth or just really just all back-ended to years two and three? Daryl Bible : We believe we're going to have operating \u2013 positive operating leverage every year, can't promise it every quarter because of the seasonality. But every year, we will generate positive operating leverage from 2019 to 2020, 2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022. Mike Mayo : Okay. And then just a separate follow-up question. It sounds like you really are planning to have a strong long-term company. You said that, you're taking a very measured approach. I guess just maybe a little bit more from Bill on the old SunTrust side. Kind of what are you seeing that's not going as well as you expected that you could do better? Then maybe Kelly you can chime in too. Kelly King : Honestly, everything is going really well and I don't have any area that I'd say is not going as well as expected. There are a lot of areas that are going much better. To be honest, the integration of our people and our teams whether it's corporate and institutional group, or our community bank all of those are integrating extraordinarily well. So personally, I've seen some real upside in terms of revenue momentum particularly because of how well our teams are working together. I've had the chance to visit Bill has had the chance to visit with a lot of our teams in the last 90 days especially. And again, you walk into the room you would not be able to detect that this is two companies just having come together. You think they've all been working together for a long time. Bill Rogers : Yeah, Mike, I'd say just we entered it in with some good momentum. Kelly outlined some good loan momentum and legacy SunTrust coming into that. There was good loan momentum in BB&T as well. So that's carrying over into the early weeks of the year. On the investment banking side and the relationship and the teamwork that's going on with the commercial community bank it's just off the charts. I mean, we feel really good about that. And of course we're one month in. But the things that you want to see in terms of pipelines and teamwork and all that I feel really good about. So the \u2013 I think generally just strong momentum and the business is heading into the merger. Mike Mayo : Thank you. Bill Rogers : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask a bit about on the credit side. And Daryl, you mentioned that you're going to redo the marks again. We're going through CECL. I assume that's in your provision guidance. Can you help us understand, when we move to the PCD and non-PCD within the 35 to 50 basis points of charge-offs how much of the legacy SunTrust charge-offs are we going to see in that number? And is there any room where just \u2013 the math ends up looking better than the guidance just because of how the mechanics of the charge-off recognition works with path of book marked? Daryl Bible : Yeah. So, Ken what I would say is that, our guidance between 35 and 50 we believe we can be within that range. Until \u2013 there's a little bit of uncertainty in the marketplace right now. So we widened the range out a little bit. SunTrust portfolio is performing very well. We have good marks on it. We did sell a few credits. Nothing of substance, but we did sell some that we wanted to just dispose of. But for the most part their credit profile is really strong as well. So I wouldn't say there would be any impact. When we do convert from PCI to PCD, there will be about $200 million that will basically come out of the purchase accounting market and go into the allowance out of the $500 million that we have allocated to it. That's a little bit of a nuance, but that's just how the CECL accounting plays out. But I don't know Clarke do you want to add anything? Clarke Starnes : Yeah. I don't see any big changes and things look very stable right now. And our guidance around the range depends on the economy and also how fast some of our consumer segments grow. We've got a lot of attractive, higher margin consumer opportunities now between the two companies. So it's really dependent upon the mix and the economy. But as far as stability of asset quality right now and our outlook it looks good. Ken Usdin : Okay. And my follow-up just on provision versus charge-offs on this point. You have the wider range of charge-offs, but I guess is it fair to say that the provision pretty much matches if you just look at your full year guidance versus what the charge-off guide implies for losses? Just the moving parts between provision and charge offs that would be helpful? Thank you. Daryl Bible : So, I'll start and Clarke can jump in. But in essence, our provision estimate is assuming charge-offs. And then all of our assumptions within CECL as you heard from all of our peers, the models are more complex now. So, you have to look at the market environment, client behavior. There's a lot more variables that you have here. We're assuming all that is static. We're assuming we're going to grow the portfolio. And our assumption is, is that mix stays the same. Obviously all that is not going to be static like that, but that's what's built into the assumption. Clarke Starnes : Yes. Ken, the way I think about it is, we're going to incrementally provide charge-offs generally at the reserve rate assuming no big change in our CECL assumption. So, you'd assume the provisions larger than charge-offs. Ken Usdin : Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. My first question is on synergies once again. So, very strong statement on positive operating leverage over the next three years. I'm wondering, if that includes any revenue synergies. And how should we think about revenue synergies going forward? The organic growth in insurance is particularly impressive, given the company was combined for only 24 days. Clearly that didn't have any impact. So, I wanted to understand what the revenue opportunities for the combined company are? And also, the other question on that, on the cost side Daryl. Could you tell us about the pacing during the year in '20 and '21 of the cost savings realization please? Kelly King : So Erika, we feel -- and Bill alluded to this, we feel very, very good about the revenue synergies. I mean really you got to remind yourself of how synergistic this combination is. SunTrust had a fantastic corporate institutional group program of fantastic wealth management strategies, a fantastic national consumer finance business, all of which are complementary can be leveraged over BB&T client base. Likewise, you alluded to the insurance opportunity from BB&T side and the BB&T Community Bank has a broader reach than the SunTrust Community Bank reach has. So they will be able to expand some of the programs that the BB&T Community Bank had into SunTrust Bank. So all of that, which of course not factored into our numbers is net very positive and accretive. We can't give you numbers on that today because, it's hard to really give you meaningfully accurate numbers. But intuitively from talking to our people, we know that all of those businesses are very synergistic, have huge opportunity. And the early response from our people in terms of executing on that is outstanding. Now insurance you talked about is real and very easy to kind of talk about. So, I'll just ask Chris to talk about that a minute. Chris Henson : Yes. Erika, I might just also mention to play off of both Bill and Kelly's comments on the Community Bank and the CIB working together. Just a couple tangible thoughts, when Beau Cummins and I sat down actually designed the model, we actually designed in the Community Bank -- embedded in the Community Bank about 200 folks that are capital markets industry specialists, corporate finance specialists. Their sole purpose in life is to integrate with the regional presence, the 24 of those to share the client base of BB&T with those individuals. And we have for example just since December 9, seven deals that would be sizable enough that we get your attention that we have been involved in with the client and we have commitments on three of those. Now, seven deals don't make a future, but seven deals in about 45 days of that nature, I think is pretty good. Both teams, I can tell you from having said in the regional presidents meetings are exceptionally excited. And it's a natural gravitation and I'll just -- I'll leave it at that. It's been very, very effective. On the -- to Kelly's point on the insurance side. We -- two years ago really said, we want to transform this business and we brought in a consultant to really to kind of transform starting with a white sheet of paper. I could not be more proud of what those guys have executed on. We set up 32 initiatives. We're on plan or on to our target to develop the -- improve the EBITDA. Just in two years for example, we've increased our margins 6%. And we've got industry-leading organic growth year-to-date. And I will tell you, the three things you want in place are in place. We've got industry-leading retention. We've got pricings coming our way and it's up 5%, another 0.5% this quarter versus third. And our new business production, which is actually feet on The Street generating business, is up 13%. And not in my career have I seen 13%. So, all things go in the insurance brokerage business. Erika Najarian : And just a follow-up question -- yes. Daryl Bible : Erika yes, I would just tell you. It's hard to call it on a quarter-by-quarter basis. We're trying to give you target estimates of what we would be at the end of each year. That's probably what I would just stay with right now. We're only eight weeks into the merger. We'll have more clarity. We'll close the first full month's books next week. So give us another quarter or two and we'll have more certainty down the road. But I think we gave you good enough estimates and feel very confident we're going to get the cost saves. Erika Najarian : Got it. And just as a follow-up, I just wanted to make sure I understood how we should treat the purchase accounting over the three years. So you mentioned that 60% of the $4.5 billion is credit and 40% is liquidity. And I guess the way I just understood the credit part of the mark is the non-accretable difference, which would not accrete on over NII. And I just wanted to make sure I was thinking about it the right way or does all of the $4.5 billion accrete back to NII? Daryl Bible : Yeah. So the nuance, I mentioned this earlier. I'm glad you called this out. So out of the $4.5 billion now that we've adopted CECL, about $200 million of it is going to go into the reserve. It's part of CECL so it's in there now. So it's in essence having $4.3 billion will accrete in as principal and cash flows come in from assets and then the liabilities that you have over those terms. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you and great logo. Kelly King : Thank you. Daryl Bible : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Klock with Keefe Bruyette & Wood. Brian Paul : Good morning, gentlemen. Kelly King : Good morning. Brian Paul : Daryl I just had a quick follow-up. I just want to make sure that I understand the comment on the CET1 10% target and then buybacks. So even though the CET1 came in at 9.4%, which was a little bit lower end versus what you guys initially thought, the accretable yield that's coming through is coming in pretty fast. So does it feel like you got your timing with the CCAR submission that you guys would probably be -- enable a buy back of stock in the second half of the year? Would that still sound like that's on target? Daryl Bible : So Brian, yeah, we did give guidance that this next quarter because of the MSR change in RWA and then the CECL adoption, our first quarter ending CET1 ratio will probably be relatively flat to what we have right now in the 9.4% range. After that I agree with you, we'll start to build pretty quickly as we generate and accrete through the earnings power there. It's really a call on Kelly and Bill's part and the board part on when we start buyback. Right now we're just sticking with the 10%. Kelly King : Yeah. And so remember that -- so remember we've said very clearly that over the term assuming things settle down there's a capital opportunity with regard to Truist. We've also said very clearly that during the first phase of our new Truist life, it's really smart to be conservative. I mean we have a lot of moving parts that need to settle down. We had a lot of existential factors out in the world, but we know about that right now with what's breaking from a medical point of view. So there's just a lot of sound reason in terms of being conservative. Now as that -- those uncertainties settle down to your point in terms of the capital level we have, in terms of the capital accretion that will occur predictably over the next several quarters there certainly could be opportunity of some capital buybacks. I wouldn't be surprised at all if that were to happen. Brian Paul : That's helpful. Thank you. Appreciate it. And then Daryl just one real quick follow-up. When I get to slide 17 on the guidance for merger expenses, for the full year the $600 million to $700 million, the footnote says it includes some of the incremental operating expenses related to the merger. I guess how much is in that $600 million to $700 million related to incremental operating expenses? And can you just remind us what that means in light of the differentiation between the incremental operating and the other restructuring and merger charges? Daryl Bible : Yeah, Brian, so if you remember at that I went through in detail the difference between what a normal merger and restructuring charges versus this incremental operating. The main primary difference is our definition of merger and restructuring basically has no future benefit. It's due just to the transaction. Because of the size of this transaction and the magnitude there are a lot of things that we are doing at putting things together that will have some benefit. So like -- in Scott's area where we're putting the systems together already working on an integration in the ecosystems. The design around putting those ecosystems together while it has a future benefit we're doing lots of that hundreds of millions of dollars of people working on the architecture that we're putting those and calling those out. For the most part, we have schedules in our tables that break out. We're going to pull those numbers out. But for the most part, it's in personnel and professional -- are where most of those charges exist. As far as the breakdown goes at a high level estimate I would say about one-third of it might be related to the MOE and the operating. The rest would probably be merchs if you could ballpark on it. But it's going to be fluid. It's going to move back and forth. Brian Paul : Perfect. Thanks for your time. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. John McDonald : Hi, guys. A couple quick follow-ups. I guess just on the CET1. Daryl, if you don't do buybacks this year with the share count that you've guided to, does that get you back up to the 10% in your modeling by the end of the year and you roughly add 10% to take you into 2021 to get back to that 10%? Daryl Bible : Our estimates right now we are plus or minus 10% towards the end of the year. It all depends on how fast the balance sheet grows and how the accretion comes in. So there's a lot of variables there. But we're in the neighborhood of 10%. John McDonald : Okay. And just to follow-up on Saul's question. The purchase accounting is a nice boost for this year. It seems like the difference between the core and non-core margins suggest something like $1.5 billion or so of purchase accounting addition to NII this year. Does that fall off quickly next year? Is it a drop by 20%? Or is it \u2013 just any idea of the pace that that kind of scales down? I know you got the merger saves that will kick in to offset it but what's the \u2013 any idea on the pace of that? Daryl Bible : Yes. I mean we gave you the terms of trying to how you would amortize it in. It does fade away over the several year process. So I think you're having the right mindset of how to model it. Just know that as you model and you factor in the cost saves you will see that you still drive positive operating leverage. John McDonald : Right. right. Okay. Last question is on to Page 18. The investment \u2013 the annualized 4Q 2020 investment of $200 million. What are you guys including in that? And how are you characterizing? Like what kind of investments and why you're calling that out just to give us some color on that? Daryl Bible : I'll give a couple. So our executive leadership team approved about more than doubling our digital teams that are out work now and they're assigned to all the different business units working to make our improvements and enhancements for our client experience. So that would be one. In personnel there are some key hires that we're putting out into the marketplace and more teams that have some skill sets that we don't have that we're trying to get more of be starting to see some branding in Dante's world, marketing going back and forth. So I don't know if anybody else wants to... Kelly King : The big one of those is the development of our innovation and technology et cetera. That has got a lot of excitement a lot of focus and a pretty immediate investment in. So that will be a big development during this year. I'll add on there commercial onboarding. I mean it's a list of dozens of things that we're seeing that are \u2013 we've got the capacity to do them. They're not opportunistic. They're really client-friendly client-focused. And we're calling it out because these are strategic investments that we think making now are going to really have an incredibly good long-term payback. And deferring them for the point of meeting some quarter just doesn't make a lot of sense. So that's the reason to put them in there and call them out. John McDonald : Okay. All right. That's helpful. So when you guys talk about the merger saves the $1.6 billion net that's kind of the kind of investments that you're netting against that \u2013 the merger saves? Kelly King : That's right. Daryl Bible : And I wouldn't expect the investment to stop at $200 million. I mean our gross saves is well north of $1.6 billion. John McDonald : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Lana Chan with BMO Capital Markets. Lana Chan : Hi, good morning. Daryl Bible : Good morning. Lana Chan : So one quick question on the preferred dividend in the fourth quarter. Was there something unusual there? And can you give us a run rate for the quarters in 2020? Daryl Bible : Yes. Lana we have a couple preferreds that are semi-annual rather than quarterly. That's the nuance that you have to factor in now when you look at the Truist dividend payout schedule. Lana Chan : But it was only $19 million, which is much lower than even I think the previous run rate? Daryl Bible : You remember though in the BB&T world, we retired one preferred and then we reissued another preferred. I think the timing of all that basically had a favorable impact in the fourth quarter. It should level out as we get into 2020 from a schedule. But if you want to talk about this offline, I'm sure myself or Rich or Aaron can handle that question for you. Lana Chan : Okay, great. Thank you. And then just I wanted to confirm, Daryl that you said before. On the core run rate for the expenses through 2020 by the time we get to the fourth quarter with the cost savings that we should see a decline in the quarterly run rate through the year? Daryl Bible : Yes. So we gave you \u2013 if you make all the adjustments baseline for 2019 is $12.8 billion. We are saying that our net cost savings for the fourth quarter of 2020 would be down $120 million, which is annualized $480 million run rate number, which is 30% and then we'll continue to build year-after-year on that. Lana Chan : Okay. Thank you. Daryl Bible : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Scouten with Piper Sandler. Stephen Scouten : Hi, good morning, guys. Not to beat a dead horse here but kind of thinking about the delayed expense savings. I'm just wondering if I calculate that, it seems like the timing is about $0.20 a year in 2020 and 2021. I'm wondering if there's any offsets that you've seen in terms of upside surprises from any sort of revenue realizations or otherwise as you've gotten into the deal so far? Kelly King : Yeah. Stephen, as you know, we didn't factor in, intentionally any of the revenue opportunities in this. What you're seeing now is the work down in the worst case in terms of expense delay with no factored in our revenue opportunities. But as you just heard Chris and Bill said, the revenue opportunities in Commercial Banking and private banking and insurance, across the board are really very, very substantial. And it's not something that we're talking like two years to get underway. It's underway, as we speak. So, it's a very conservative view to factor in the expense delay without factoring in the revenue enhancements. But, that's our nature. We try to be conservative, so we'd rather beat than miss. And so, that's kind of the way we've tried to factor it together. Stephen Scouten : Okay, great. And then, another question for me is just, in terms of restructuring business units loan runoff and things like that nature, has everything in your mind been completed here already or are in the process of what's remaining in held for sale? Or are there still other decisions to be made about additional business line exits potentially or other loans that you might look to take off the balance sheet? Daryl Bible : Yeah. Stephen, I would say for the most part we're pretty much over with from a balance sheet restructuring perspective. Everything will settle that we wanted to move off this quarter. And move forward from that perspective. We still have our divestiture that's planned later in the year probably second quarter. So that will come out of run rate when that occurs. But I think for the most part, we have pretty much everything done. Stephen Scouten : Great, thanks so much. Operator : And we'll take our final question from Christopher Marinac with Janney Montgomery Scott. Christopher Marinac : Hi. So I want to ask about compensation for the combined companies in terms of just retaining the employees that you have. Is there anything unique that you are doing or that you intend to do, just to keep competitors away and keep your team focused? Kelly King : Yeah. Chris, we've been working on that from day one, in terms of special compensation arrangements for key players. And developing a very aggressive ongoing compensation program for all of our people, whether in sales jobs or in revenue jobs. I mean for example, we did a $1,500 bonus for like 48,000 of our teammates that we just paid out in the last few months. Just as a thank you for their hard work. And so, yes we've done a lot of particular activities to try to focus on that. And so that's one of the reasons we feel very, very confident in terms of our low attrition. And in fact what we're seeing is low attrition. So everybody feels good. We've done all the right things. And we will remain aggressive in terms of taking care of our teammates, because ultimately mergers work well or not is based on the teammates. And again, all of our teammates today feel very, very good, very, very excited, very confident and again, I'll say, again the attrition is very, very low. So we feel very good. Christopher Marinac : Great, Kelly. Thank you, Bill, Daryl for all the information this morning. I appreciate it. Kelly King : Okay, thank you. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session\u2026. Rich Baytosh : Okay, thank you, Lauren. And thank you everyone for joining us. Hope everyone has a great day. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Ryan Richards, Director of Investor Relations for Truist Financial Corporation. Please go ahead. Ryan Richards : Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today and sincerely you're doing well.  On today's call are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Kelly King, and our Chief Financial Officer, Daryl Bible, will review our first quarter results and provide some thoughts for the second quarter of 2020. We also have Bill Rogers, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Chris Henson, our Head of Banking and Insurance; and Clarke Starnes, our Chief Risk Officer, to participate in the Q&A session.

And now, I will turn it over to Kelly. Kelly King : Thank you, Ryan. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining our call. I certainly hope you and your families are safe and well in the difficult environment we're all living in. I want to take a minute before we get into the numbers to just talk about culture because I believe, now more than ever, culture matters most of all of the things we can talk about.  So, you've heard us say that our purpose is to inspire and build better lives and communities. This is absolutely a critical time for us to live out that purpose. So, our mission is focusing on our clients, our teammates and our stakeholders \u2013 in that order \u2013 and we do that very, very seriously every day.  Our values are to be trustworthy, caring, operate as one team, focus on success and, ultimately, happiness for our teammates. We're focusing during this environment, number one, on the health and safety of our teammates. We are pleased that about 35,000 of our 58,000 teammates are able to work remotely.  We are spending a lot of time supporting our clients, particularly on the Payroll Protection Program. We're spending a lot of energy and focus supporting our communities through our Truist Cares $25 million philanthropic donations that we did early in the cycle.  I'll tell you that our teammates are working really, really hard. They're working 24/7 in many cases. They're working very, very closely together. It's incredible to see the kind of positive results that we're getting, particularly like in the PPP program where our people were able to stand up literally overnight, an automated portal to allow our clients to access automatically with us in terms of getting their applications in.  Our teammates are bonding faster than we would ever have expected. And I can say to you today that our culture at Truist is really, really strong. If you're following on the presentation, I'm on slide 5. Just as a reminder, after the combination, we're the sixth largest US commercial bank by assets and market value. We have a very strong, number 2 weighted average deposit market share in the top 20 MSAs. We have 12 million households, 58,000 teammates. We are very well positioned, we think, to achieve our purpose. We are recognized as one of the highest rated financial institutions, and we're continuing to grow loans and deposits, particularly in this period of flight to quality. Daryl is going to cover a lot of information about our very strong capital and liquidity in just a bit. I would point out that our diversification is a real strength. We are very diversified in products, services and geographies.  On slide 6, we talk about some of the things we're doing with regard to the crisis. Like others, we have been providing payment relief assistance, including forbearance, deferrals, extensions, other ways we can help our clients. We've already done over 300,000 accommodations for consumers, 16,000 for our commercial clients. We've temporarily waived ATM surcharges. And we're uniquely offering a 5% cashback on qualifying card purchases for important basic needs.  We're real pleased that we've been able to continue to allow appointment interventions with our clients in terms of particular needs they have. We're fortunate that 90% of our branches have drive-throughs, so we've been able to keep those branches open in terms of activity.  We've been really focused on the Paycheck Protection Program. Our average loan amount is about 323,000. We've been authorized for 32,000 companies, representing about 1 million employees. And we're expecting funding to be a little more than $10 billion on the first round, and it will likely be more on the second round, if it is in fact approved. We're providing financial relief programs for small businesses in many other ways also. And we've been able to fund, without hesitation, extensive line draws for our commercial clients.  For our teammates, we've awarded $1,200 coronavirus relief bonuses to about 78% of our teammates making less than $100,000 a year. We've been very aggressive in providing work from home and other alternative work strategies for our teammates to provide safety for them.  We also increased our onsite special rate pay for those that have to be at work in critical roles, with $6.25 special pay for those on hourly and $50 a day for those that are not. Our Truist Foundation is contributing $4 for every $1 that our Truist teammates donate to our One Team Fund, which helps our teammates that are in financial hardship and need assistance. For our communities, we announced earlier a $25 million philanthropic contribution which has really gone a long way to help. We donated $1 million for each of the CDC Foundation and Johns Hopkins. And our Truist Foundation donated $3 million to local United Way organizations. On page seven, just a few financial highlights. We did have $5.6 billion in taxable-equivalent revenue. Adjusted net income available to common shareholders was $1.18 billion. Diluted earnings per share on an adjusted basis was $0.87. Our return on tangible common equity adjusted was 15.5%, which is very strong in this environment. And our adjusted efficiency ratio was 53.4%. So, we feel really good about that.  Our January and February, like a lot of people, were really strong. And then we, of course, ran into all the challenges that we're all experiencing because of COVID-19. Interestingly, insurance and mortgage continued to have strong performance throughout the entire quarter.  Our asset quality, as Clarke will describe to you, is actually very good right now, but we know that's the calm before the storm. And that's why we added a strong $893 million provision in anticipation of the challenges that we know we will face.  We have a tight focus on our teammates and our clients and our communities, which we believe is our job number one right now. If you go to slide 8, just a couple of the unusual items this quarter. We know it's a little messy, but we got the issue of the merger and the COVID impact. While merger-related charges are $107 million before tax, about $0.06 negative impact after tax, the incremental operating expenses, these are ones that provide future benefits, but they're not a part of the ongoing run rate, so we call them out separately, and that's $74 million or $0.04 a share. And then, the COVID impact in terms of cost and foregone revenues is about $71 million or $0.04. So, there really is, in my view, about $0.14 of unusual items, which gets you to the $0.87.  If you go to deck 9, slide 9, in loans and leases, it's been an interesting period. You can see that our first quarter average loans was $301 billion, but by the end of the period, it was $319 billion. Obviously, we had a surge at the end of March. We had about $18 billion in drawdowns. That continued into early part of April. We had another about $1.4 billion. Again, it's kind of subsided. It's been relatively flat since then. We do expect substantial PPP funding. As I said, we have in process about $10 billion in committed loans and we expect will be drawn down relatively soon.  In terms of the market, everybody wants to know what's going to happen. I do too. But the truth is we just don't know. It depends, obviously, on the depth and the length of the health crisis as we work through that, and then how that has the knock-off effect with regard to the economy.  The good news is, going into this, the economy was very strong. The bad news is small business will really struggle to recover from this. Still, I would say to you, Americans are resilient and I believe our country is likely to outperform the worst expectations.  If you look at deposits on page 10, same kind of thing. Average balances were $334 billion. It popped up to $350 billion as we had an increase of $15 billion during that period of time. About $7 billion of that was line draws, but then we also had some seasonal increases and some flight-to-quality deposits that moved in, which we're very pleased to see. Our total average cost of deposits decreased by 6 basis points, which we're very happy to see.  So, let me turn it to Daryl now and let him give you some detail. Daryl Bible : Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I want to talk about the key points from the first quarter and provide some color on current business conditions.  Turning to slide 11, net interest margin of 3.58% up 17 basis points. Purchase accounting contributed 52 basis points to reported net interest margin.  Core net interest margin was 3.06%, down 8 basis points. The decline reflected the full quarter impact of the merger of equals, lower interest rates and our liquidity build in March.  The yield on loans and leases held for investment increased 8 basis points as the benefit from purchase accounting more than offset lower short-term rates.  The yield on our securities portfolio decreased 3 basis points. We became more asset sensitive due to floating rate loan growth, expected higher prepayment, trimming out Federal Home Loan Bank advances and increased non-interest bearing deposits. Our loan mix was 55% floating and 45% fixed. Current trends suggest our net interest margin will decline further from a full quarter impact of lower rates, line draws, PPP funding and elevated reserves at the Fed. To protect loan yields, we are implementing towards an all new production and we continue to aggressively reduce deposit costs.  Turning to slide 12. Non-interest income increased $563 million, reflecting a full quarter on the merger of equals.  Insurance income increased $39 million or 7.6% versus first quarter 2019 due to higher P&C commissions, organic growth, strong retention and increased pricing. Residential mortgage income was strong, with origination volumes at $11.7 billion. Refi was 56% of originations and gain on sale margins were 176 basis points. While forbearance is a potential headwind, that could be offset by higher volume and spreads.  This quarter, several fee income categories were impacted by the pandemic. Investment banking and trading was impacted by $92 million due to the increase in CVA reserves arising from lower interest rates and wider credit spreads. As shown on the slide, discretionary actions resulted in lower service charges on deposits and card and payment-related fees. Current trends include seasonally strong insurance income, strong residential mortgage production, partially offset by lower service income due to forbearance, lower asset valuations and lower purchase volume related to COVID.  Turning to slide 13. Non-interest expense increased $856 million, reflecting a full quarter impact from the merger. Merger-related costs included $107 million of merger-related and restructuring charges and $74 million of incremental operating expenses related to the merger. Discretionary actions in response to COVID impacted non-interest expense by approximately $65 million and included a $1,200 bonus to all teammates earning less than $100,000.  Personnel expense included $44 million of incremental operating expenses related to the merger. This was positively impacted by the decrease in the market value of non-qualified plan assets, which is offset in net interest income and other income.  We also updated our intangible valuation. As a result, annualized full-year amortization expense for 2020 was revised to about $660 million. Current trends in expenses include relief measures, such as special pay for some client-facing teammates, and measures to better protect our teammates, clients and communities. We continue to have good core expense discipline even in the face of COVID health crisis.  Turning to slide 14. Asset quality remained strong, but economic conditions have deteriorated. Truist will continue to apply the CECL standard adopted January 1. Our MPA ratio increased 9 basis points to 23 basis points, largely due to the adoption of CECL and the transition from PCI to PCD.  NPLs were 32 basis points to total loans, up 17 basis points from year-end, primarily due to the PCI to PCD transition. Adjusting for this transition, our MPA and MPR ratios were essentially flat from last quarter.  Net charge-offs were 36 basis points of average loans, down 4 basis points. The provision was $893 million and reflected the reserving in accordance with CECL. The increased provision was mostly due to a significant loan growth and scenarios reflecting a weaker economic outlook. The increase also reflected a full quarter of post-merger activity. Our allowance coverage ratio was 1.63%. The combination of our allowance and the unamortized fair value mark remains a very robust 2.71% of total loans. The adoption of CECL resulted in strong coverage ratios at 4.76 times for net charge-offs and 5.04 times for NPLs. We expect second quarter asset quality matrix to be elevated reflecting COVID stress across the loan portfolios.  Turning to slide 15. The table on the left summarizes our exposure to industries we believe are most vulnerable in the current environment. We have very low exposure, reflecting meaningful diversification from our merger. Outstanding loans to the group totaled $28.4 billion or 8.9% of loans held for investment at the end of March. Our oil and gas portfolio is weighted towards lower risk sectors.  Outstanding balances on levered loans totaled $10.5 billion or $3.3 billion of loans held for investment. 42% of our leveraged loans are investment grade or the equivalent. We are actively managing these portfolios and will continue to make underwriting or risk acceptance adjustments as appropriate.  Turning to slide 16. The $582 million increase in the ACL from the initial CECL adoption reflects rapidly evolving market conditions. Our standard practice is to use three scenarios to inform the CECL allowance, implying judgment to assign the probability of each scenario.  These scenarios include Moody's baseline with implied rates for an optimistic scenario and one stress scenario. We also consider heightened industry concerns from the pandemic effects, together with the impact of government relief packages when calculating the CECL estimate. Slide 17 adds additional details on our loss estimation approach. Turning to slide 18, our capital ratios declined slightly, mostly due to a significant balance sheet growth related to line draws. However, our capital levels remain strong relative to regulatory levels for well capitalized banks.  Our CET1 ratio was 9.3%, down 9.5% in the fourth quarter. Our dividend and total payouts are 61.4% for the first quarter.  We are taking a prudent approach to capital due to the uncertainty of the economy. Our CCAR submission incorporated this impact. Ending CET1 ratios for the internal baseline and severely adverse scenarios well exceeded regulatory minimums and internal post stress policy goals.  We intend to utilize the five-year CECL transition for regulatory capital purposes, which provides a 17 basis point benefit to CET1. We expect to grow capital and serve our clients throughout this challenging time.  Turning to slide 19. This slide shows the second best performance among peers under stress conditions and from a capital resiliency perspective due to strong PPNR and lower credit losses.  The table compares credit loss reserves reported by Truist and its peers at March 31 to their respective stress losses under 2018 DFAST. We use stress losses from 2018 as this was the last year the Fed published DFAST results for BB&T and SunTrust. We think that 2019 will be similar given the improved risk profile and earnings power of the combined company.  As the column on the right shows, Truist's 35% ratio of credit loss reserves to stress losses is above the peer average of 33%. However, after layering in the unamortized fair value marks on the SunTrust portfolio, which totaled $3.5 billion on March 31, Truist stress loss coverage increased to 58%.  This is a great illustration of how the merger enhanced the risk profile of both companies and resulted in a defensive balance sheet that is insulated by purchase accounting marks and CECL reserves. It is also another example of why we believe we are better together at Truist. Turning to slide 20, we acted quickly in response to the pandemic to term out short-term borrowings and increased cash to meet capital funding needs. As such, our liquidity ratios remain strong, with an average LCR of 117% and a liquid asset buffer of 19.6%. Our access to secure funding sources remains robust.  We have experienced a flight to quality amid recent market volatility, with total deposits increasing $15.5 billion and we continue to see robust growth this quarter. We have sufficient liquidity to fund our PPP loans from our existing Fed balances at the Fed.  In addition, holding company cash is sufficient to cover 17 months of contractual expected outflows with no inflows.  We are withdrawing our guidance for 2020, given the uncertainty going forward. For the second quarter, we're providing guidance on several categories based on linked-quarter changes versus the first quarter of 2020.  We expect earning assets to grow in excess of 5% on linked quarter average basis, reflecting the increase in loans from C&I line draws and the PPP program.  Total taxable-equivalent revenue will be down a few percent linked-quarter, reflecting a meaningful decline in net interest margin, driven by lower rates, liquidity build and fee income pressure, as noted earlier. Core non-interest expense, adjusted for the merger, amortization and COVID expenses, is expected to be flat linked-quarter, excluding the adjustment to the non-qualified plan. We're making good progress, generating savings some third-party spend and facilities optimization. Depending on the length of the economic downturn, how deep the downturn goes, and how effective the government programs play out will influence scenarios that unfold. You can see net charge-offs increase throughout the year and possibly add more pressure, so there will be allowance. We are also striving to achieve positive operating leverage despite this challenging environment.  Now, let me turn it back to Kelly for an update on the merger and closing thoughts and Q&A. Kelly King : Thanks, Daryl. So, in terms of the accomplishments \u2013 and keep in mind, we really just merged these two companies in December. So, we've accomplished a lot. Most importantly, we rolled out the Truist culture. We were able to complete 32 townhall meetings. We had a few at the very end that we had to cancel or defer because of COVID-19, but we got through most of the enterprise and the reception to it was extremely good. We introduced and rolled out the Truist visual identity and logo. We did complete the purchase of Truist Center, which is our corporate headquarters here in Charlotte. We launched our Truist Foundation.  And we were able to go ahead and begin consolidating some redundant real estate portfolios that we had that we could go ahead and begin to get some early cost saves.  So, in terms of the next steps, if you think about it right now, we really have two major priorities. Number one priority is focusing on COVID-19. We're laser focused on taking care of our teammates, making sure everybody's safe and well. We're doing everything we can possibly do to support our clients, not only in terms of their safety, in terms of interaction with us, but also in terms of helping them sustain the economic challenges that are going along with this terrible experience we're all going through. We're trying to be very willing to invest and be creative in terms of how to support our communities, and we're doing some really interesting things there in terms of broadband and all types of things that we can do to help communities that are really, really struggling.  So, the second priority, of course, is keeping the integration and conversion on track. We believe we are in a good place there. It's hard to know exactly what may happen with regard to any delays. It really depends on the depth and the length of the health crisis. But at this point, we still feel good about where we are in terms of our planned conversion and integration activities.  In terms of our performance targets, we still believe in the medium term. We would project a return on tangible common equity in the low 20s, adjusted efficiency in the low 50s. You can see we're already pretty much there. And we're still remaining very confident in terms of our $1.6 billion in net cost saves.  Exactly when we achieve that kind of depends on, obviously, the environment we're living in. If it's a V, then we'll recover pretty quickly and we'll hit these in the not-too-distant medium target type of range. If it's a U, it will take a little bit longer, and that's just pretty obvious.  Regardless, we believe that we will be a top-tier performer, whatever the absolute numbers are. I will say to you that all of the benefits of the merger look better now than they did a year ago.  Finally, if you look at our value proposition slide, we believe we provide a really strong value proposition. We are a purpose-driven company, committed to inspiring and building better lives and communities. That's really important, more important than ever in today's world.  We have an exceptional franchise with diverse products, services and markets. We have strong market share and vibrant fast-growing MSAs in the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic and a growing national presence. We have a very comprehensive and diverse business mix in banking, capital markets and insurance.  And very importantly, we are simply better together. We're stronger. We're more resilient. We have best-in-breed in terms of talent, technology, strategy and processes.  We are very uniquely positioned to deliver best-in-class efficiency and returns, while investing in the future. As I said, we have net $1.6 billion of net cost saves yet to come. These complementary businesses are clearly going to yield substantial revenue increases as we develop the synergies.  Our returns and capital are buoyed by purchase accounting accretion, which Daryl has described to you, and we're making meaningful investments in technology capabilities, our teammates, marketing and advertising. We have a very strong capital and liquidity with resilient risk profile, enhanced by the merger. We are very prudent and disciplined in risk management and financial management. We have a very conservative risk culture, leading credit metrics among the highest-rated large banks. We have diversification benefits that arise from the merger we discussed. We stress test very, very well \u2013 separately and together. We have a very strong capital and liquidity position and being enhanced even with the flight to quality.  And we have a very defensive and, I would call it, strong and resilient balance sheet supported by purchase accounting marks combined with the CECL credit reserves.  Because of the strength of our balance sheet and our liquidity, I would expect us to continue our dividend as we move forward into as far as we can see. So, like I said in January, if you liked us a year ago, you should love us now, but we continue to believe our best days are ahead. Ryan, I'll turn it back over to you. Ryan Richards : Thank you, Kelly. John, at this time, will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session? Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Saul Martinez of UBS. Please go ahead. Saul Martinez : Hi. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask a little bit about the outlook for credit and the interplay with the accounting and a lot of the moving parts there. So, on slide 16, you go through your day one, January 1 true-up and the additional reserve builds in the first quarter. But, Daryl, how much of it \u2013 can you just tell us how much of the $3.5 billion credit mark is \u2013 $3.5 billion loan mark, sorry, is for credit versus liquidity and rates? Daryl Bible : Yeah, Saul. So, first, I would tell you, when we came up with our day one estimate on our reserve, we had three scenarios that we came up with. And we weighted our stress scenario 40% on day one. So, we started the year off with a strong reserve from that perspective. When we moved over and made our provision this quarter, we went through multiple scenarios as we always run. And then, with Moody's changing their scenarios every few days, we actually ended up running 10 different scenarios through quarter-end into early April, trying to use an overlay to help us adjust on that CECL number that we came up with.  And then, at the end of the day, you go back to using expert judgment. And we always have qualitative factors this year, for this time. Clarke and Ellen and the team really had to spend a lot of time qualitatively because the models have limitations when a government's infusing over $5 trillion and they have to weigh in on what the effectiveness is. You have all these payment plans basically out there. And you need the expert judgments on how effective those programs might be. So, there's lots of qualitative adjustments that we came up with. We feel very good about the reserves that we have there.  As far as your fair value mark, it's a combination of credit, liquidity and interest rate, and it's at $3.5 billion. Saul Martinez : Okay. How much of that is credit versus industry? Daryl Bible : We didn't disclose that, Saul. Saul Martinez : Okay. Daryl Bible : Saul, at the end of the day, it's all going to accrete into earnings. It's all going to be used as a lower value for when we \u2013 you get a little bit of benefit because you have a lower book value when you apply your reserves. So, it's all going to count, whether it's credit, interest rate or liquidity. It really doesn't matter. Saul Martinez : Okay, got it. But I'm trying to understand the loss-absorbing capacity for credit a little bit more. And then, just going forward though, you did mention that there is a possibility for reserve builds. And as I think about going forward, if the economic environment does worsen and credit does worsen more than what's sort of embedded in your outlook, how does that play out? Obviously, on the SunTrust book, you'll have to \u2013 and on your BB&T legacy book, you'll have to true-up your ACLs. But on the credit mark, if it turns out that whatever that portion of the $3.5 billion that's your credit marks is insufficient and the losses will be larger than that, how does that work in terms of the accounting? Do you need to re-estimate that down and then get a subsequent benefit on purchase accounting accretion? I guess what I'm asking is, even going forward, do you get a \u2013 is there a risk of sort of a double hit to your equity base from reserve builds and credit mark adjustments that only come back over time? Daryl Bible : So, when you come up with your CECL reserves, you really don't take into account the fair value mark. It is a lower book value, so you end up providing less. It really is going to depend on what I said in my prepared remarks. What happens in the economy? Is it going to be more stressful? If the government plans, how effective they're going to be and then how deep it really is. Clarke? Clarke Starnes III : Saul, we assume through a weighted probability of all those scenarios that Daryl described and we did our estimate. We assumed very sharp initial GDP contraction, a spike in unemployment and then lingering high-single digit unemployment for the two-year reasonable supportable period. And our mean reversion was basically similar to what we experienced after the Great Recession.  And so, then we get, to Daryl's point, a good bit of sensitivity analysis around the different stress portfolios. We looked at the historical and projected redefault rates on the different mods and deferrals. And we baked all of that into our qualitative overlay. So, we feel like the estimate today is the best we know. Obviously, if things deteriorate worse, then we would have to provide more. If it holds up as we projected, then we're well reserved. Saul Martinez : I understand it on the CECL reserves, but on the unamortized loan mark, the losses are greater than $3.5 billion. And you recalibrate those estimates and you're now assuming [indiscernible], how does that work? Daryl Bible : So, you have a year to true-up your goodwill, but that's based upon any miscalculations you had at 12/6. So, we feel pretty good. We finalized all of the marks. I think I mentioned what the new amortization amount is on the intangible. So, all that was trued up this quarter. Actually, we have a table on it in the deck. So, all that kind of finalized from that perspective. We really can't go back and readjust any of that. Saul Martinez : Okay. Okay. So, there's no \u2013 there's not really a risk there that there's an incremental loss associated with that on top of the CECL reserve, I guess? Daryl Bible : That's correct. Yeah, that's right, Saul. Saul Martinez : Okay, thank you. All right. Thanks a lot. Daryl Bible : You're welcome. Operator : We will now take our next question from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning, Daryl. Good morning, Kelly. Daryl Bible : Hi, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Can you share with us \u2013 it looked like your purchase accounting accretion came in stronger this quarter. Your tangible book value, obviously, jumped up to $26 a share. That was probably attributed to, I guess, stronger purchase accounting accretion. Can you give us some color on how that worked out this quarter versus maybe prior expectation? And so, we came in higher than expected and it was mainly due to loans paying off, both on the corporate side and on the consumer side. So, it was a little bit above our own estimates that we had. On a go-forward basis, I would say that you can't count on that basically over-estimating throughout the year. It's possible, but you wouldn't count on it. So, if you look at core versus reported margin, we were 52 basis points difference. I would probably think it averages closer to the 40 basis points on a consistent basis. But you never know what's going to happen on a quarter-on-quarter basis on payoffs. When people pay off their loans, you have to basically take in all the accretion. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then, on slide 19, which was very insightful and appreciate putting that together, can you share with us \u2013 and maybe it's just simple, the economic assumptions are not \u2013 aren't different than the stress test. But why \u2013 in CECL accounting, everyone, you and your peers, are looking at life-of-loan losses. Why aren't the reserves even higher? And yours are the highest relative to the stress losses? Why don't they match what the stress test we're testing for? Again, is it simple as the economic assumptions? Daryl Bible : Yeah. So, there's a difference between CECL and stress testing. Stress testing is a dynamic, living, breathing process. So, you basically have to project new volumes and grow for runoff depending on whatever happens. CECL is basically a static balance sheet with runoff assumptions. So, there's differences there.  The chart that we put in on 2019, just to give credit, we basically plagiarized that from Jason Goldberg. I give Jason a lot of credit for that. But I think on that table, it clearly shows that our reserves that we have versus the combined company's losses that we added together from 2018 is at 35%. That's a little bit above the peer group. And as you add in the fair market value, it's at 58%.  One thing to note, though, if you actually look at our company run results on a combined basis in 2018, that number was basically 44%. The reason I'm telling you that is, is that we don't have our 2020 CCAR stress results yet from the Fed. That will come later this quarter. But we do have what we submitted to the Fed a few weeks ago. And if you look at what the company run stress results were on the severely adverse, we were basically at 52%. So, I think that shows a good indication that, as we put the company together, Clarke and Ellen have really derisked a company and we just are a less riskier company than we would have been on a combined 2018 basis. So, our reserves then at 52%, and then if you add in the fair value mark, you're at 84% of our \u2013 we came up with $10.8 billion of losses in our 2020 severely adverse. Gerard Cassidy : Very helpful. Thank you. Daryl Bible : Thank you. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the call and the color. Two questions. One, you gave us the number of customers that have been requesting deferrals. I think it's 330,000 on the consumer side and 15,000 on the wholesale side. Can you give us a sense as to the percentage of balances that those each represent? Clarke Starnes III : Yeah. Betsy, this is Clarke. On the consumer side, it's about $9 billion. That's for both onUps and Service for Others. So, it's about $8 billion for balance sheet. So, roughly 3%. On the commercial side, it's about roughly $10 billion or so, 5% or 6%. So, again, I would note the far majority of all of our re-agings have been with accounts that are current to start with, even in our subprime auto as an example. So, again, I think this is a very unusual environment. So, you have a lot of people that are worried that have \u2013 maybe have lost their job or maybe have not, but they're worried and they're just all little different than normal, in that most are current to start with. Betsy Graseck : And in your forward look on the CECL that we're just talking through, how high do you expect those numbers to go? Daryl Bible : It really depends on the three factors I said earlier, Betsy. Right now, we feel we are adequately reserved from what we know. There is a lot more that we don't know than what we know, though, and how things are going to impact. The government's going to have over $6 trillion of stimulus when it's all said and done. That's 3 times more than what they had in the Great Recession. We really don't know how effective those programs are going to be. So, you really need to let a lot of that play out. All of the forbearance that's been occurring right now, that all has to play out. And some of the clients may not make it. We feel really comfortable where we are reserved today, and we'll just see what happens as we move forward. Kelly King : So, Betsy, keep in mind too that the effects of the Payroll Protection Program will keep people whole in terms of their income. And those that are furloughed, in most cases, as I understand it, their unemployment insurance because there was an increase in the normalized unemployment insurance substantially, in many cases, people have more take home income than they had before. So, it's hard to say exactly today, in the short run, that that would be a huge negative impact. Obviously, if this is extended and the government programs don't provide continued stimulus, then it will be a factor. But in the short run, the government has actually done a pretty good job in terms of providing short-term buffer. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then, just moving to expenses, on the $1.6 billion, I understand it's hard to know the timeframe, given everything that's going on. I'm just wondering how much of that $1.6 billion do you feel you can control today versus maybe you put on the \u2013 you put aside because it's redundancies that you don't want to touch at this stage? Kelly King : Well, all of it is, over term, still achievable. You're right, though some of it may be deferred because of the environment we're in today. Because of more people working away from the office, the connectivity, et cetera, there may be some things that we're not able to do as quickly as we had anticipated. But our people are studying this daily. And as of today, they have not discovered any material issues that will dramatically slow down our progression in terms of integration. And the progression of the integration is what drives call centers. Daryl Bible : I'll give you a couple of examples. So, on third-party vendor, right now, our teams are still working on it, but we're probably 35% to 40% of the way of our target. So, we'll have about close to $100 million annual run rate save this year. And over the next couple of years, we have already locked in $135 million of that. So, that's progressing well. We're making really good progress on our corporate real estate portfolio. We have over 30,000 square feet. Right now, we have known savings in there of about $66 million of what we're executing on. If you look at what we're going through right now, with people working at home, we have to really evaluate the impacts of that after it's all said and done. But that could be an opportunity for much more saves. So, we have $30 million \u2013 we might go down to $20 million over the next three to five years. You just don't know that. So, that could be even a bigger opportunity. So those are just a few examples, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Thanks. Operator : I will now take our next question from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Mike Mayo : Hi. A few more questions about your forward guidance. Kelly, I thought you said, maybe Daryl, talked about the potential for positive operating results this year, which seems pretty tough with your second quarter guidance. As it relates that guidance, only slight expenses in the second quarter you just mentioned \u2013 vendor, real estate, all these other things that you said that was the extra COVID effect and the other part of the guidance. Some other banks have said, expect much higher reserve building in the second quarter. I know you've given some numbers on that, but just exactly where you stand. Thank you. Daryl Bible : Yeah, Mike. So, I would definitely say it's going to be a challenge from linked quarter from first to second. We will continue to execute and do the best that we can within the parameters that we have. And we aren't giving up on our positive operating leverage. We're going to do the best we can. We may not achieve it this year. But we still may. It is not out of the woods. It all depends on how quickly the economy recovers. And if it's a sharp V, we have a shot at it. Mike Mayo : And the other question, the reserve build in the second quarter, some banks are saying, 'hey, look, since the end of the first quarter, conditions have gotten worse.' I guess you said you use Moody's. I guess maybe have some flexibility to use your own capital markets group for forecast, like the larger banks. Given the decline since the end of the first quarter, would you expect more reserve building? And even though you said you're 84% reserved from, what, your 2020 bank submitted stress test, which is a big number. That's all in with your purchase accounting marks, if I got that correct? Daryl Bible : Yes. You're right on that. As far as \u2013 we use Moody's and we also have a couple other scenarios that we run. But we went into early April running scenarios in our reserve. So, we didn't cut it off on the 31st. We closed a little later this quarter just because we're later in the cycle. So, we went through at least the first week of April with that information. Clarke Starnes III : Yeah. And again, if the economy actually underperforms those scenarios, we would have to provide more, but based on what we know today, we think we're well reserved, but we're certainly watching it. Mike Mayo : Okay. And so, how much of the expense savings have you achieved so far? And you said some of the timeframes might slip. You mentioned some areas that you'll still have. You have a pandemic with the biggest merger in your history happening at the same time. So, it's a tough situation. It sounds like you're managing through it. But maybe just to get out on the table now what we should expect as opposed to waiting till later. Daryl Bible : Yeah. So, from specific expense savings, we have some savings and there has been some slippage just with what happened in March, in that, with COVID, some of our expenses are a little bit elevated. We pulled forward buying a bunch of our laptops and Wi-Fis and other equipment. That got pulled forward into the first quarter that we were planning on later in the year. So, a little bit elevated from that perspective. And our goal was to try to get our expenses down to 30% of the $1.6 billion by the end of the year. We are on track so far this quarter to doing that. We were trying to have some buffer and be ahead of that. It doesn't get any easier as we get into this next quarter to be honest with you. But we still have a shot at getting our 30% at the end of the year if we have a sharp recovery. Mike Mayo : All right, thank you. Daryl Bible : Yeah. Operator : We will take our next question from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Good morning. Regarding the exposures, the at-risk credit exposures on slide 15, the $28.5 billion, I know you indicate on that slide that you have qualitative overlays for the affected industries. So, can you give us a little bit more color on that \u2013 on the magnitude and maybe the amount of loan loss reserve against those portfolios and maybe the loan marks against them? Kelly King : We haven't disclosed that level of detail. I would tell you this that, for each of those segments, we have done detailed analysis, things like risk grade notching and a good bit of sensitivity to the downside. And each and every one of those, we've looked at the modification or deferral request. And so, we've used that to add additional overlays on top of what the models would have driven in. They're considerably higher than the other segments, I will just tell you that. John Pancari : Okay. All right. And then, in terms of the insurance business, I know you indicated in your second quarter outlook that you do expect COVID could dampen the organic trends in the business. Can you give us a little bit more detail how that could play out? And is there an offset from perhaps any better pricing that you see in the industry? Just want to see how you think about how that plays out. Thanks. Kelly King : Chris will cover that. Christopher Henson : Yeah. This is Chris, John. Thank you for the question. First off, we would expect second quarter to be up about 3%. That's seasonally strong this quarter of the year. And you're right, the slow down as a result of COVID really is creating declining exposure units that could be lost, people, lost business, what have you, and that will slow economic \u2013 new business production. But to your point, there will be a potential pickup in pricing.  When we went into the Great Recession, we went in with the backdrop of a soft insurance market. We go into this one \u2013 it's actually a very strong market on the back of 2017 and 2018 being the two largest [indiscernible] loss years in history. So, we're kind of in the up 4.5%, 5% range right now. If we've got to go into one, that's a good backdrop to have \u2013 if you're going to have it to back. And just for this quarter, for example, rates are up 4.5%. If you throw on top of that lower interest rates, these P&C underwriters are going to be struggling on their investment returns. So, they will likely continue to keep upward pressure on the rate environment. So, I think your intuition is exactly right.  We expect momentum in pricing for the balance of the year. But we do see tough new business reduction. So, we might have been looking at \u2013 this past quarter, we had 7.3% organic growth. Kind of looking forward, it's looking more like maybe in the flat to 2% kind of range for the balance of the year. John Pancari : Okay. Thanks, Chris. Operator : We will now take our next question from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Kenneth Usdin : Thank you. Good morning. Daryl, just wondering if we could step back out, step on the revenue side. You talked about second quarter revenues down a few percent. And just following on bit of the fee part that was just talked about, can you help us just understand NII versus fees? There's so many moving parts involved, but if you can directionally just help us understand the moving parts and direction of fees, that would be helpful. Thank you. Daryl Bible : Yeah. Just high level, Ken, I would tell you \u2013 and Chris commented on insurance up. Insurance is seasonally strong second quarter. That won't change from that perspective. Service charges, we have some programs in place to help our clients during this time of stress. That's what Kelly talked about, the 5% cashback. We are waiving ATM fees, so people can meet their banking services. People are coming in now, we're getting more requests for relief on NSF and we're granting that. So, I would say, service charges overall might be down a touch from that perspective. Depending on what interest rates do and credit spreads, Beau's area, while the volumes overall are lower, there is CVA, the $92 million, that line item has a chance of recovering potentially on what happens with that. And then, mortgage, mortgage will have good volumes, strong. The offset will be the impact on forbearance on the servicing. We did try to factor in some estimates on the MSR valuation already. We don't know if that's the full impact of that, but it is embedded in there. So, we did adjust for that accordingly. So, mortgage will probably have a decent quarter would be my guess. Kenneth Usdin : And on the NII side, also can you just help us understand, your balance sheet looks like it's going to keep growing. You mentioned the difference between stated and core NIM. But can you help us understand \u2013 a lot of other peers are talking about NII growing from here. You guys have the purchase accounting as an extra factor in that. Any way you can help us just parse out the moving parts there too? Thanks. Daryl Bible : Yeah. I don't foresee \u2013 unless purchase accounting really is stronger than we think, I don't foresee NII being positive second quarter versus first.  Core margin, if you looked at our sensitivity, and you probably need to go back to our disclosures back in January when we disclosed, what, down 100 basis points \u2013 our disclosures that we show on our earnings reports are gradual. So, that's assuming that the 100 basis points would go down throughout the 12 months. And at that point in January, it was a negative 1.78% or 1.72%. If you say, that's equivalent to, like, a shock of 50. So, what we experienced in March was a shock of 150. Now, you had a little bit weird going on with LIBOR. And LIBOR, we'll talk about in a second. So, you had a shock of 150. So, if you take the 1.72% and multiply it by 3, that would probably be what the impact would be, rough estimate, on what our NII change might be for second quarter from that perspective. Then we have built a lot of liquidity. Now, we built liquidity because we were in a stress period, we want to make sure we can meet our clients' need both from a funding and from a deposit perspective. So, the cost of carrying what we're carrying at the Fed right now is anywhere from 10 basis points to 15 basis points.  If you look at our balance sheet right now, and through Friday on March \u2013 or on April 17, our balance sheet, the total balances are $518 billion. Our deposits now are $364 billion. So, all the government stimulus checks that started to come in last week, we had one day, I think it was Wednesday, where we went up $6 billion in deposits in that one time period. Our PPP funding is going to start going on the books. It started last week. It's going to go on this week and the following week. We'll probably have $330 billion of loans. So, we're definitely going to have much higher earning assets.  The other thing I would note is that our deposit costs, we were at 70 basis points, down 12 basis points on an interest-bearing basis. And if you look at March, our interest-bearing deposit costs were already 56 basis points. When you go back and look at the Great Recession and you look at how far the deposit costs get down to back then, we got down to about 23 basis points. So, I don't think we're going to get to 23 basis points in the second quarter, but we're going to get in the 20s for sure over the next couple quarters as we continue to push down rates if these rates stay where they are.  So, I think we've got a lot of things that we have to manage with, but our margin will be down, will be down because of liquidity. But once we feel that the stress is over, we can reverse the liquidity pressure there pretty easily and get that core margin back. So, hopefully, that's helpful. Kenneth Usdin : Very much so, Daryl. We're going to talk about LIBOR. And that is a point I was wondering if you could talk about. How are you seeing LIBOR normalize down as you look out over time? Thanks for all the color. Daryl Bible : Yeah. So, it peaked on April 1 at 1.02%. It's now at 0.67%, one-month LIBOR. We have about $130 billion net LIBOR assets tied to one-month LIBOR right now. So, as that migrates down, that will kind of put in that full effect of that interest rate sensitivity that you saw there. We aren't there yet. It still has room to come down some more, but that will also allow us to push down our deposit costs faster too as LIBOR is coming down as well. And when you look at the money market equivalent, that will all kind of come down together. It will hurt our asset side, but we're going to make it up on the deposit side. Kenneth Usdin : Got it. Thanks very much. Daryl Bible : You're welcome. Operator : We will now take our next question from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Matthew O'Connor: Good morning. You guys have addressed the risk that some of the integration gets delayed if we don't get a V-shaped recovery here. I guess, on the flip side, the risk of losing customers and staff to competitors is probably a lot less than maybe some people feared, partly because the virus, partly the action that you're doing for your staff, being very generous. So, maybe you could just talk, Kelly, Bill, about the engagement of your staff and how you keep the cultures, kind of both of them in the same direction. You can't do it from the town halls that you were doing before. But talk about some of those kind of softer aspects of the doing the business and your customer base \u2013 employee base. Thanks. Kelly King : Bill, why don't you go ahead and maybe I'll add a comment at the end? William Rogers, Jr.: Okay. Thanks, Matt. I think as you point out, the retention numbers were already good coming in from a teammate perspective. And we just did a survey that was an engagement proxy. And in this incredible environment, the survey actually showed high levels of engagement from our teammates. In many ways, the cultural integration has been accelerated by months, if not years, because people are operating under stressful conditions. The teamwork has been spectacular. I think, Kelly, you would echo that. No one's wearing a jersey because they're all headed towards the same objective.  So, I think you point out accurately, there are elements of this that are advantageous as we go through this process. And I've personally been just really, really proud of the work that our teammates have done.  The town halls and the rollout of purpose, mission and values, we were well underway there, and that has been a really good catalyst because everybody's got something to lean forward on. They're all speaking the same language and operating from the same playbook. Kelly King : And I will just point out one additional point. I said earlier, culture matters always. It really matters in a time like this. A really big part of our culture is just taking care of our teammates. We get that our clients come first, but you can't take care of your clients without doing a really good job for your teammates. So, Truist is unique in terms of having a fully paid for pension plan, 6%-on-6% 401(k) match. And then, we do things like $1,200 bonuses and premium pay for people on the lines. So, all of those things, our teammates really appreciate. And so, they see that, during difficult times, we're going to take care of them even if there's some sacrifice in terms of short-term profitability. We're going to take care of our teammates, so they can feel safe and secure, and then they can help our clients feel safe and secure. Those memories will be here for decades. And so, we feel very good about our culture. As Bill said, it is accelerating and it is strong as steel. Matthew O'Connor: Helpful. And then, I just have a question for Daryl. You talk about, for new loans, implementing some floors. Can you just talk about the rate, how much above the floors you are? And I assume, as loans come up for renewal, you'll attempt to do the same thing on those loans? Daryl Bible : Yeah. So, David reported, I think a week or two ago, that the floors that he's putting in range anywhere from, I think, 25 basis points to 75 basis points from a LIBOR perspective. I think those are the floors that he's putting in from that perspective. That's the LIBOR rate, not the spread over it. Matthew O'Connor: Okay. Thank you. Daryl Bible : Welcome. Operator : And we will take our next question from Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. I just had one follow-up question. Of the $480 million in annualized cost saves that you noted, how much of that is achievable without interruption to pandemic-related support of your employees and your clients? And if I'm interpreting, Daryl, your answer to Betsy's question, $100 million of annual run rate savings from third-party vendors, $66 million from loan savings in corporate real estate. So, it sounds like at least $166 million of that $480 million would have nothing to do with supporting the employees or clients. Kelly King : So, Erika, just one comment. Daryl, can I add? You're right. You can count, I think, in terms of expenses being bifurcated. There are expenses that are independent of kind of the LIFO effect \u2013 some of our vendor contracts, some are independent of COVID and we've seen substantial reductions in run rate of vendor contracts already and more to come.  With regard to the teammates, there's a one-time big charge we had with regard to the $1,200 bonus, but the ongoing, from this point forward, teammate charges are not marginally incremental.  And in terms of the impact on the conversion, it really depends. But today, our people are functioning very well, working offsite. And keep in mind, in the technology area, we've already \u2013 we've had thousands of people working offsite forever. So, this is not a new idea. It's just more people doing it. And so, as long as they're able to continue to do their scoping and their mapping and their programming remotely, which now we see that they can, it's not self-evident that there will be a dramatic change with regard to our integration and conversion scheduling. Daryl Bible : Yeah. For the second quarter, Erika, we are paying a premium to our teammates right now that are on the front line. So, you're going to see an elevated charge in personnel with that. Depending on how quickly we basically can adjust from work at home, that will fade away. We also are actively getting more laptops in, so more people on the call centers can do more of their work at home. So, that will subside as we get more of that equipment in as well that we've accelerated from that perspective.  As far as the implementation of third party and facilities, as they execute and play out, that's when you get the savings. So, you may not see as much early on this year, but as it goes out throughout the year, and as we continue to move, it will start to build, such that the fourth quarter will have a higher annualized impact than what you would see at this point from that perspective. So, a lot of good things, although some of the third-party savings is tied to conversions.  Or just to be transparent, there's some big card conversions coming up, some big conversions coming up in the wealth and broker dealer areas. So, like, right now, in Joe's world, he's planning to still stay on track with an earlier conversion in his broker dealer. I think that's going to be in the first part of 2021. If that stays on track, that might miss a little bit at the end of 2020, but he wasn't supposed to be there at the end of 2020. He's scheduled more for early 2021. But if that plays out, then some of those things will come in at that point in time. So\u2026 Erika Najarian : Thank you. Operator : We will now take our next question from Stephen Scouten of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Stephen Scouten : Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks. First, I want to say thank you guys for the way you all are leading in community impact. Being in one of your affected communities, I'd say the leadership is appreciated and important. So, thank you guys for that.  I wanted to ask you, as it pertains to your capital and how you've talked about longer term you need to get back to 10% to regain buybacks. And I know in this environment, it's probably far ways out. But I'm just curious, how are you thinking about that number, the 9.3% CET1 versus kind of the \u2013 I think it was 8.7% if you had fully phased in the CECL impact and kind of how that pertains to that 10% target and where you think about buybacks way down the line? Kelly King : So, nobody's thinking about buybacks today. We are in a very strong capital position and are still accreting capital. We still made $1 billion even before adjustments this year \u2013 this quarter. So, we will be steadily moving up unless there are dramatic increases in loan losses, which we would not project at this time. Again, if it's a long U, that makes a difference. We all understand that. So, we have said that our intermediate term target was 10%. We've said we did that because of the uncertainties that we knew about with regard to the merger. We said we were doing it because of uncertainties we didn't know about. We didn't know about COVID, of course. But thank goodness, we did prepare for that. And we're in a really good position. Now, as those uncertainties subside in terms of the merger integration and surely the health crisis will go away and surely the economy will improve, then we have said, and I would reaffirm, we have capital opportunities as we go forward below that 10% level. It will depend on the then existing circumstances, but there are opportunities available for our shareholders. Daryl Bible : The other minor point is remember that PPP loans that we're putting on the book have a zero percent risk rate. So, we put $10 billion on from the first round. That's not going to cost us any risk weighted capital.  And then, from a leverage number, even though we're going to fund it ourselves, it's not going to really cost us because we're basically just trading out at 10 basis points balance at the Fed to 100 basis points earning asset from PPP. So, from a capital perspective, those should be fine. Stephen Scouten : Great. Helpful. And then, one other thing, I'm curious, we've seen some others in the industry kind of tighten underwriting standards around resi mortgage, HELOCs, other categories, have you guys \u2013 you've always been fairly conservative on lending. But have you further tightened any of your underwriting standards? And kind of within that, what are you seeing with the forbearance requests in terms of industry concentrations? Thank you, guys. Clarke Starnes III : This is Clarke. I would say yes to that question. Across all our asset classes, we've done pretty extensive reviews and we have made underwriting and risk acceptance changes as appropriate. You would expect us to do. So, I think we would be more on the conservative end, and they are in place today. We've also worked hard to be very careful about what we call any non-essential lending right now, given the uncertainty.  So, as far as the modification requests, I'd say, from the commercial side, we've had a lot in the stressed industries that we laid out, things like hospitality, et cetera . And then, on the consumer side, it's been predominantly on the mortgage and all those sides right now. Kelly King : And if you recall, we had made some adjustments with regard to our underwriting standards even pre-COVID. So, we were already anticipating a potential slowdown. We had made adjustments already. Stephen Scouten : Thank you, guys, very much. Operator : We will take our next question from Christopher Marinac of Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Christopher Marinac : Thanks. Good morning. Daryl, is there an average life on the PPP loans that we should expect? Daryl Bible : Sure. Chris, we don't really have a good estimate on how much forgiveness is going to be out there. If I gave you a number, it would be a pure guess right now. So, I don't really know. Whether it goes out \u2013 my guess is, everybody's making the loans now. So, you've got a big tsunami. Remember, the SBA has to process all these forgivenesses in 60 days. It probably is going to take some time to process all that. So, my guess is it might linger on into three, four, five months before all the forgivenesses are happening, and we'll see how quickly they do that. But then, there will be some and portions of some loans that will stay the full two years. We will accrete the earnings and we're booking them at a discount. The last time I looked at our average discount that we'll put on the books, about 2.7% discount, and that will accrete in. And then, when it pays off for forgiveness, we'll take all that in at that point in time. It plays out to two years and you just earn it over that time period. Christopher Marinac : Got it. That makes sense. Thanks very much, guys, for all the information today. Operator : And we will take our final question from John McDonald of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. John McDonald : Hey, guys. Two quick follow-ups. Wondering if you could give any color on how the reserve is allocated between consumer and commercial buckets as of today? Daryl Bible : John, I would just say \u2013 and one noteworthy thing, for the increase for Q1, about 70% of that reserve, that provision increase was related to commercial and about 30% was consumer. I have to look and see on the split between \u2013 I guess we can get back to you on that, John. On the split in the actual allowance itself, we can get you that. John McDonald : Okay. And then, just kind of wandering \u2013 this comes up with questions frequently \u2013 is there a dumbed down example you guys could give us of how the marks absorb credit and how that helps? Is it just the idea that, if you have a write-off on a marked loan, you're marking it down from a smaller amount? So, if it was a $100 loan, you're writing it down from $95 as opposed to $100, so it's a smaller charge-off? That's kind of the question. Like, how does that mechanic work of helping absorb losses, the marks? Daryl Bible : Yeah, that's exactly right. So, basically, your book value is lower. So, you apply your reserve against the lower balance. So, it helps you a little bit. But I think of it as its earnings that are coming in. Those earnings can be used to provide for other provision or could fall to the bottom line from an earnings perspective. John McDonald : Meaning the PAA? Daryl Bible : Yeah, exactly. I think to your first question \u2013 Unidentified Company Speaker : I've got it. Daryl Bible : You've got it? Yeah. John, back to your first question, the wholesale reserves for Q1 are about $2.270 billion and the consumer is $2.941 billion. John McDonald : Okay. Daryl, when you think about the loss absorbency, it comes in the form of PAA. So, you've got an extra cushion. That's how you kind of think of it absorbing losses, you have more cushion on the PAA side? Daryl Bible : Yeah. We definitely have more absorption, more cushion from that perspective. But also, I think when you just cut \u2013 the bank coming together and the diversification of how we came together, we really don't have any really significant exposures in any of our portfolios because, as we came together, we were much more diversified. And that should play out when the new stress test come out from the Fed later this quarter. Our hope is that we're going to have a really strong PPNR, a really strong loss number and very resilient capital ratio. We should, hopefully, be well under the 250 basis points stress capital buffer. Kelly King : And remember that, in all of our portfolios, essentially, the exposure was reduced in half because of the doubling of the denominator. So, it was an automatic diversification that's material in this kind of environment. John McDonald : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : We have no further [Technical Difficulty]. Ryan Richards : Okay. Thanks very much. And thank everyone for joining us today. Hope everybody has a good day, and please stay well. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Thank you very much for joining our call, and I hope you and your family are safe and well. Given the challenges that we face, I think this was a really strong quarter, primarily because we lived our purpose. And I will say I am really, really proud of our team. Our purpose is to inspire and build better lives and communities. And that is really, really important in the challenging environment we are experiencing today. We focused intensely on taking care of our clients. I\u2019ve been really, really involved with our teammates, creating an inclusive and energizing environment, really focusing on trying to empower our teammates to learn and grow and have meaningful careers. And I think we\u2019ve done a good job across the board with regard to all of our stakeholders in optimizing their long-term returns. We do all that consistent with our values. We\u2019re trustworthy, caring, one team, success, and ultimately, trying to provide a sense of happiness for our teammates, and all of the people that we have a chance to inspire and support. If you\u2019re following the presentation, on Table 5, I just want to point out some of the things that we\u2019ve done, because I think in today\u2019s world, this is as important, if not, more important than the actual numbers, because our communities need a lot of help. We\u2019ve been really focused on living our purpose. You\u2019ve heard about our Truist Cares philanthropic initiative, where we pledge $50 million to rebuild communities. Some of the things we\u2019re doing are really, really exciting. For example, we\u2019re doing technological support in areas that are un-served or underserved with regard to Internet and WiFi capabilities. We\u2019re using that to support automated reading capabilities in these areas, because these kids are sheltered and placed at home, and don\u2019t have access easily to learning. We\u2019re supporting our communities, doing a lot of work with CDFIs in terms of supporting small businesses, minority-owned businesses, women-owned businesses, feel good about that. Just to give you a perspective, over the last few years on our onUp Movement, we provided about 6 million people with tools to provide the financial confidence. Since 2009, we\u2019ve done over 12,000 community projects. We\u2019ve touched over 18 million people through our Financial Foundations program, which is focused on financial literacy. In high schools, we\u2019ve reached over 1 million high school students. And since the merger of equals, in very short period of time, we\u2019ve provided $440 million in financing to support 2,200 affordable housing units, creating 1,400 new jobs across our footprint. We\u2019ve been really focused on addressing racial and social inequity. We are expanding our efforts to advance equity, economic empowerment and education for our clients, our communities and our teammates. I\u2019m very proud to say we observed Juneteenth holiday by giving our people time-off. We had a virtual town hall with our 3,000 of our teammates that I was able to co-host along with Ben Crump, and it was a really, really good dialog, good discussion. We\u2019ve had over 200 Days of Understanding, where we bring together our teammates and give them an opportunity to just dialog and talk about what\u2019s going on, challenges that they face. Those have been really, really great sessions. I participated in some and found them to be very, very informative and helpful. We\u2019re in the process of doing even more town halls. We conducted unconscious bias training. So, we\u2019re doing a lot to try to help our communities and our teammates weather through the storm and get better through the storm. And I feel really good about that. I\u2019ll show you how this is playing out. With regard to our second quarter highlights, on Slide 6, we\u2019re very pleased that we had taxable-equivalent revenue of $5.9 billion. It was up 7%. But as you know, that was merger timing affected. We did have adjusted net income of $1.1 billion, feel good about that. Our diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis were $0.67, but our adjusted basis earnings were $0.82, which was very, very strong relative to the environment. Our return on average common equity on adjusted basis was 7.26%. Return on average tangible common adjusted was 14.17%. And I was very pleased that our adjusted efficiency ratio was 55.8%, which is very strong in this environment. Our asset quality in terms of actual metrics, which you can get more detail on from Clark were actually fantastic. But as we all know, that was substantially impacted by a lot of the CARES Act decisions around forbearances, et cetera. So, we know that it will get worse. That\u2019s why we\u2019re prepared well in terms of our reserving for our future allowances. We felt good about fee income, robust capital markets activity. Residential mortgage was fantastic. Our insurance brokerage operation, which really, really, is important in times like these, had a record quarter. We continue to have very good expense discipline on a core basis. And our common equity tier 1 increased about 0.4% to 9.7%. So, we felt very, very good about that. If you look on Page 7, I just want to have a few of these material special items that affected the quarter. We did have securities gains. So, these were non-agency mortgage securities that we have for a while. They had special gains and some risk of downside loss for those gains. And so, there was a good opportunity for us to take those. That did provide $300 million of pre-tax gain or $0.17 a diluted share. Now, we use most of that to extinguish debt. We took a loss on debt of $235 million before tax. That improves forward run rate, which Daryl can give you detail on, but that was very good. That was a negative $0.13. We did have substantial merger-related and restructuring charges of $209 million that was $0.12 negative. And then, as we\u2019ve explained to you, we do have incremental operating expenses that are related to the merger. They\u2019re not technically merger-related that we call out in a category. But they\u2019re not a part of our run-rate going forward. So, we consider those to be unusual and that\u2019s $0.07. So, when you net through all that, it will be a positive impact of about $0.15. If you look at Slide 8, just a few comments with regard to loans, it was a very interesting quarter for loans. I mean, at the beginning of the quarter, loans were booming. We were having line draws like everybody else that were substantial. We were engaged in PPP, where we were the third largest PPP producer, producing about $13 billion in those loans. We were happy to do that, although it was very hard in terms of supporting our small business clients. There was not much normal loan activity in the quarter. So, it was just kind of an unusual quarter. Our average balances were $322 billion versus a $315 billion end of period. So, you can see what happened. We advanced up all the lines, and then they started paying down, so now 80% of the COVID-related line advances have already been paid. So that activity was kind of a roller coaster, it\u2019s settled down now, and we feel good about where we are. Consumer loans decreased slightly in this stressed environment just because people broadly speaking, are spending less. We did see a decrease in residential mortgage on the loans that we hold, but our mortgage business is generally booming. We had mortgage applications of $21.3 billion in second quarter and we originated $14.6 billion in the quarter. So, we were really, really active in that, and frankly, moving resources into the mortgage area, that\u2019s a very, very important area for us. We did have substantial activity increasing loans in indirect, which was primarily due to huge demand for loans to finance recreational and power sports. So, we are seeing some robust activity in some categories, some temporary robust activity in others. The underlying normal activity is, I\u2019d say, relatively stable, not going down, not going up. There\u2019s just not much going on right now on reasons you would understand. So, we feel overall good about our loan book and loan activity. And we think we\u2019re well positioned as we go forward with confident returns to be able to meet the needs of our clients. Just a couple of comments with regard to deposits on Slide 9. Deposits are booming. Our noninterest-bearing deposits were $113 billion, up $20.7 billion on a linked-quarter basis. Total deposits were $36 billion on the same linked-quarter basis. I will tell you that the majority of that is core, but there are search balances related to line draws, PPP loans and government stimulus. We believe there continues to be a flight to quality and we\u2019re the beneficiary of that. Business accounts drove about 80% of the growth in DDA. So that was what you would expect, businesses drawing on lines, investing into deposit accounts, et cetera. Our deposit mix for the second quarter consisted of 34.7% noninterest-bearing deposits, which is very strong, 26% on interest-bearing, 34% of money market, and savings were 8.9%. Our cost of average deposits and average interest-bearing deposits decreased 29 basis points and 38 basis points, respectively, down to 22 and 32, respectively. So, it\u2019s a very, very strong story for deposits, I will say that we have real opportunity in terms of our interest-bearing deposits at 32 basis points. We didn\u2019t move them down as aggressively in the second quarter, maybe some did. We\u2019ve wanted our clients have time to adjust. I would see there\u2019s a real opportunity for us as we move into third quarter, and we\u2019re already taking very bold and decisive action with regard to that. So, let me turn it now to Daryl for some more detail. Daryl Bible : Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I want to cover key points from the second quarter, discuss current business conditions and provide an update on cost saves. Turning to Slide 10, net interest margin was 3.13%, down 45 basis points. Purchase accounting contributed 46 basis points to reported net interest margin versus 52 basis points last quarter. Core net interest margin was 2.67%, down 39 basis points impacted by lower benchmark interest rates, higher Fed balances, and COVID-related deferred interest. The yield on loans and leases held for investment decreased 81 basis points due to lower interest rates, lower purchase accounting accretion and deferred interest and loans with forbearance. The yield on the securities portfolio decreased 25 basis points primarily due to higher premium amortization. Asset sensitivity moderated as a result of higher fixed rate assets, lower fixed rate federal home loan bank advances and lower benchmark interest rates, mitigating down rate scenarios. We\u2019re projecting loan yields \u2013 well, we\u2019re protecting loan yields with rate floors on new commercial obligations and modifications, and we\u2019ll continue to manage down deposit costs. We expect to report net interest margin to be flat for the remainder of the year. Turning to Slide 11, Noninterest income includes $300 million in security gains related to the sale of non-agency MBS, excluding these gains, core noninterest income was up $160 million. Investment banking and trading income increased $156 million on strong core trading activity and elevated counterparty reserves in the prior quarter. Residential mortgage income was up $96 million on strong volumes and improved margins, partially offset by lower servicing due to higher prepayments. Refi was 65% of originations and gain on sale was 319 basis points reflecting very favorable conditions in mortgage. Insurance income increased $32 million, up 5.8% to record levels, primarily due to seasonality and pricing. Organic revenue grew 2.1% versus like quarter. Service charges on deposits decreased $103 million mostly due to reduced incident rates. Card and payment related fees were affected by lower transaction volumes due to lower consumer spend. Wealth income decreased $43 million as market devaluation impacted wealth fees. Turning to Slide 12, noninterest expense increased $447 million, mostly due to $235 million loss and debt extinguishment, $102 million increase in merger and restructuring charges, and $55 million increase in incremental operating expenses related to the merger. Higher merger related expenses reflected professional services associated with integration and increased severance charges. We remain highly disciplined around core expenses. Excluding the abovementioned items, adjusted noninterest expense increased $55 million. This was mostly due to higher COVID related operating costs and performance-based incentives, partially offset by lower marketing and client development expense. We anticipate COVID-related operating expenses were decreased as we continue to take measures to protect teammates, clients and communities. We identified areas where cost savings can be accelerated including personnel expense, corporate real estate and third-party spend. We now believe we can accomplish 40% of the $1.6 billion in net cost saves by the fourth quarter this year, up from 30% we previously shared. Our FTEs declined 735. We expect further reductions throughout this year. We also closed 42 branches in non-overlapping markets. Turning to Slide 13, asset quality remains relatively stable, reflecting moderate deterioration in certain asset quality ratios and improvement in others. Our NPA and NPL ratios increased 2 and 3 basis points respectively to 25 and 35 basis points. Most of the NPL increased was in CRE, commercial construction and leasing portfolios. Net charge-offs increased 3 basis points to 39 basis points on average loans and leases. Our provision for credit losses totaled $844 million, reflecting stressed environment and the allowance build of $522 million. For the second quarter in a row, this allowance build was essentially self-funded by purchase accounting accretion. The allowance was 1.81% of loans and leases, up from 1.63%. Our coverage ratios remain strong at 4.49 times net charge-offs, and 5.24 times NPLs. A combination of our allowance and unamortized fair value mark is very robust at 2.76% of total loans. Our asset quality ratios were tempered by relief from the CARES Act. Our teammates have been very responsive to our clients, helping them navigate the pandemic. As of June 30, client accommodations totaled $13.8 billion in consumer loans, $21.2 billion in commercial loans, and $211 million in credit card balances. This represented an 11.2% increase in the loan portfolio. About 1/4 of the clients who received an accommodation continue to make payments on their loan. We expect third quarter asset quality metrics to deteriorate in response to COVID stress across the loan portfolios. Turning to Slide 14, as you can see on the table on the left, our exposure to vulnerable industries remains low and reflects diversification we achieved from the merger of equals. Outstanding loans to sensitive industries totaled $30.1 billion versus $28.4 billion. However, $1.1 billion was an increase due to PPP loans. Excluding PPP loans, sensitive industry outstanding increased only $200 million or about 1%. Energy related balances were essentially flat, and our oil and gas portfolio continues to be weighted towards lower risk factors. Hotel, resort, and cruise line outstandings increased to 2.4% of loans held for investment from 2.1% last quarter. This reflects the inclusion of hotel REITs and real estate secured by hotels which were not previously included. Outstanding balances to restaurants increased modestly to 1% of loans held for investment from 0.8% at the end of March. Outstanding balances on leveraged loans totaled $9.5 billion, down 10% from last quarter. We are actively managing our sensitive industry portfolios. This includes deep segment reviews and reflecting credit adjustments in our risk rates. Turning to Slide 15. The allowance increase of $522 million to reflect the consideration of increased economic stress, the sensitivity to affected industries, and the proactive grading changes to reflect the current environment. The estimation process incorporates multiple economic scenarios, including assume likelihood of worsening conditions. Our assumptions include double-digit employment followed by sustained high-single-digit unemployment as we extended GDP recovery throughout 2-year forecast period. We also consider the effect of government relief packages and payment accommodations on expected losses, and made adjustments as needed to address model limitations. Taking into account the ACL amount of $6.1 billion and dividing it by the Truist, and 2 heritage companies net charge-offs for the past 12 months. We come up with a 5.7 times coverage ratio, which we believe is strong. Turning to Slide 16. Truist is very well positioned relative to peers in a strained credit environment. The table on the left utilizes DFAST 2020 results. This shows our estimated loan loss rate of 5.1% ranked third best among peers, and 60 basis points better than the peer average. We also have significant loss absorbing capacity of $9.2 billion due to the combination of the ACL and the unamortized loan marks. Our loss absorbing capacity represented 2.9% of end of period loans, and 60% of $15.3 billion 2020 DFAST stress losses. This slide shows how the merger of equals enhanced the risk profile of both companies and produced a resilient and more diversified balance sheet. Turning to Slide 13. Our capital ratios improved nicely across all ratios and remain strong. Reported CET1 ratio improved 9.7% from 9.3% in the first quarter. CET1 ratio benefited from current earnings, lower risk weighted assets and purchase accounting accretion. We issued $2.6 billion a preferred stock during the second quarter to further improve our capital position. Our second quarter dividend and payout ratios were 67%. The Truist Board will vote on a resolution to approve the third quarter common dividend of $0.45 at the July meeting. Turning to Slide 18. We continue to see strong liquidity and we are prepared to meet the funding needs of our clients through this challenging environment. Second quarter average LCR was 116% and a liquid asset buffer was 17.8%. Our access to secured funding sources remains robust with over $200 billion in cash, securities and secured borrowing capacity. Holding company cash is sufficient to cover 21 months of contractual and expected outflows with no inflows. Turning to Slide 19. We continue to be encouraged by the acceleration we\u2019ve seen across the digital platform. Digital commerce grew 11% during the year-to-date period through May. We also saw a 10% increase in the number of active mobile app users over the past year. Digital transactions also increased nicely. Mobile check deposits were up 23% from last May to this May. The acceleration in the digital has resulted in increased paperless adoption as statement suppressions are up 5%. One of the motivations of the merger was to combine technology with touch, to generate trust with our clients and to be able to meet their needs. That is why we are really pleased that the legacy BB&T mobile app, U, earned the number-one, J.D. Power ranking in the 2020 U.S. Banking Mobile App Satisfaction Study. In addition, LightStream legacy SunTrust national online lending division won the number-one ranking in J.D. Power 2020 U.S. Consumer Lending Satisfaction Study among personal loan lenders. These are great examples for the best of both capabilities as Truist advances its diverse digital and online capabilities. As it relates to guidance, we withdrew our 2020 annual guidance due to the uncertainty going forward. For the third quarter, we are providing limited guidance based on the third quarter linked quarter changes versus second quarter. We expect taxable equivalent revenue to be down 3% to 5% after excluding one-time security gains from the sale of non-agency MBS. Factors impacting revenue include a reduction in earning assets, mostly due to the line draw repayments, seasonally lower insurance income and lower residential mortgage spreads and servicing income. In addition, investment banking and trading faces a robust second quarter comp. We expect to report net interest margin to be flat and core net interest margin to increase modestly. Core noninterest expense adjusted for merger costs and the amortization is expected to be down 1% to 3%. We also anticipate net charge-offs to be between 45 and 65 basis points. Now, let me turn it back to Kelly for an update on the merger, closing thoughts and Q&A. Kelly King : Thanks, Daryl. So, if you follow along on Slide 20, I just want to mention a few things about how we\u2019re doing. The good news is our cultural development is fantastic. In fact, I would say that it is accelerating because of the challenges, because people are facing some extremely difficult challenges day-to-day. And that really kind of pulls the groups together. The sense of team-play in the organization today is phenomenal, far better than I could have ever hoped for. So, we feel great about how we\u2019re doing in terms of the organizations coming together. Had some really good recent developments, we branded Truist Insurance and Truist Foundation. We introduced Advisor Desktop to heritage BB&T Financial Advisors. And we were able to consolidate social media platform, leveraging Truist.com. Our conversions are in many cases right on schedule, for example, institutional broker dealer, mortgage origination and wealth are right on schedule for the second half of this year and the first half of next year. We did tell you last quarter and throughout the quarter that we were reassessing the core bank conversion, because of all of the challenging circumstances that we\u2019ve all faced. Those include, amongst others, a strategic reallocation of resources for the COVID response. When all of this hit, we had to focus on what was the most important at the moment. For example, we spent a lot of our IT and other support resources in the PPP program, and developing portals for our clients to do automatic deferrals, and developing automatic portals for automatic scheduling, so people could schedule appointments with our people remotely. We had work-from-home transitions for Truist and our offshore vendors, as we got all of the computers into everybody\u2019s homes. That just takes a little bit of time. And we did experience some critical vendor disruptions that hampered our conversion activities. So, we want to take all that into account. We want to make sure we do it right, do it well, that\u2019s most important. And so, we now anticipate the core bank conversion will be in the first half of 2022 versus the second half of 2021. It\u2019s not a dramatic change. But it is one we wanted to report out to you. And we think it\u2019s the best way to continue to provide the highest quality service for our clients. Still, we are committed to our $1.6 billion of net cost saves as Daryl described. And we\u2019re very pleased that we\u2019re able to pull forward expense savings around facilities, vendor spend, personnel cost, so that we now expect 40% of the $1.6 billion on an annualized basis to be available to us this year by the fourth quarter. And then we stay on track with 65% for the fourth quarter of 2021, and then the full 100% on fourth quarter 2022. So, it\u2019s just a little bit of pulling forward and 2020 versus a little bit less than 2021. So, we feel good about all of that, and think that will go very, very well. Wrapping up on Slide 21, just a couple of comments with regard to the value proposition we offer. You\u2019ve heard me say before and I still continue to believe this is a fantastic organization. The combination is excellent. It is fantastic for our shareholders. And the reason is this. It is an exceptional franchise with diverse products, services and markets. This is the 6th largest commercial Bank in the United States. We have strong market share in vibrant, fast-growing MSA markets. None of that has changed. We have a comprehensive business mix with distinctive capabilities in traditional banking, capital markets and insurance. And clearly, coming together, we\u2019ve already experienced what we thought would happen, which is that together, we get the best of breed, best talent, best technology, best strategy and best processes. And we really saw that this quarter with the strong performance in investment banking and insurance. One from SunTrust, one from BB&T came together beautifully, just like we thought it was. We have unique positioning to deliver best-in-class efficiency and returns. We feel very strong about our cost saves as we said, and the projected efficiency ratios that we talked about. We feel very confident about medium-term targets of ROTCE in the low 20%s, adjusted efficiency in the low 50%s, common equity tier 1 ratio of 10%. We\u2019re closing in on that right now. So, this is going to be a best-in-class efficient, highly profitable organization. And largely, that\u2019s because we have strong capital and strong liquidity. And we have a very resilient risk profile, very strong, prudent, experienced risk management team, conservative risk culture, diversified benefits from the merger. We stress very well, which you just saw. And so, we have a very defensive balance sheet, which is insulated by purchase accounting marks combined with CECL credit reserves. So, all of that we knew would be true. We didn\u2019t know it would be tested as much as it is being in this environment, but it really is proven to be the kind of underlying or girding support that we need to be a very resilient organization in this environment. And this is a very challenging environment. I will say to you that as difficult as it is \u2013 as difficult as it is to predict what\u2019s going to happen in the future, I believe the economy is resilient. I believe ultimately, we will be okay. I believe the American people will do the right thing to create an equitable society with hope and opportunity for everyone. Everyone wins when we have an opportunity for everybody to have an equitable future. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re working very, very hard to. Personally, I believe we will be a lot better off if we can get a lot more emphasis on love and caring for each other now to create a bright future for America and everyone in it. Let me turn it back now to Ryan. Ryan Richards : Thank you, Kelly. Alan, at this time, will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session? Operator : Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] All right, and we\u2019ll take our first question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Hi, good morning. Kelly King : Hey, good morning. Daryl Bible : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : Kelly, I just wanted to dig in a little bit on the expense side. You mentioned that you\u2019re pulling forward the cost saves over the next couple of quarters. And maybe you can remind us how far along on that $640 million you are already as of 2Q. And then, give us some sense in the discussions you had to accelerate that in 2020. What else you found that maybe you could add to the profitability opportunities here in 2021 as well? I know you kept the 65% flat. But knowing you, I\u2019m sure you unearthed a few other potential items of costs saves. Kelly King : Yeah, Betsy, as you would expect, we\u2019re doing a deep dive in all of those areas to be sure that we can continue to provide high-performance profitability metrics, even as we orchestrate through this difficult environment. The pulling forward is just frankly getting more aggressive than we had even originally planned with regard to vendor renegotiations. We\u2019ve got a ton of buildings, as you might expect duplicative buildings, some small, some large. We\u2019ve got a major task-force working on that. And we decided to be very aggressive in terms of consolidating and eliminating a lot of those buildings. And that\u2019s pretty immediate cost reductions when you do that. We have a very aggressive personnel rationalization plan in process. And a good bit of that is already underway in 2Q as you alluded to. It will begin to flow down to the bottom line more in 3Q and 4Q as we get executing on that. The plans are well developed. And now, it\u2019s just a matter of executing on the plans. Now, keep in mind that while we\u2019re now calling this out, as we head into the remainder of this year and 2021, we also have some really good opportunities in terms of revenue. Our Integrated Relationship Management program is going extremely well. And we are redoubling our efforts with regard to that, because this is the time when our clients need us more than ever. And so, we are across the organization focusing on generating opportunities to help our clients and, of course, in the \u2013 so doing, we generate additional revenue for us. So we\u2019ve got all of these expense initiatives, but they\u2019re huge revenue initiatives as well, which gives us great confidence. We\u2019re focusing on the expense with you. From day one, we didn\u2019t add in revenue opportunities as a part of projecting. But I can just tell you that the development along the way in terms of realizing those revenue synergies is going far better than I would have ever expected, including all of the COVID difficulties related to that. Daryl Bible : The only thing I would add to that, Betsy, is that, in the first or second quarter, we had some COVID-related expenses. We talk about them, but we don\u2019t carve them out. We believe that those COVID expenses will moderate over the next quarter or so. So you\u2019ll be able to really see the cost saves as they moderated. But we\u2019re probably in the 15% to 20% range right now. And with the cost savings that Kelly said that we are actively working on, by fourth quarter, we\u2019ll have 40% of it we believe in fold. Kelly King : Yeah. And also, I didn\u2019t mention too, Betsy, so we, in addition to those items Daryl mentioned, we had COVID-related reductions in income including money back on credit card purchases, the other types of incomes, NSF reductions, waivers, so were just so pretty big number. We haven\u2019t been trying to call that out, because I think most people are trying to kind of do the same thing. But it is material. Betsy Graseck : Right. So maybe you could just, as a follow up to the question, just talk a little bit about how you\u2019re anticipating the forbearance programs that you have in place. Stating from here, I just \u2013 I\u2019m not sure, are you going to be retaining people in forbearance until further notice? Do they roll off at a specific point in time? And maybe speak to both, the loan side as well as the fee waivers that you just mentioned? Clarke Starnes : Yeah, Betsy, this is Clarke. I\u2019ll take the credit accommodations. I know Daryl and Kelly gave you the statistics there. I would tell you this we are seeing a substantially lower new incidence of client accommodation requests. I think much like others, the big wave was early on. And so, our focus now is actually on the expiration of the initial forbearance that we granted and whether they\u2019re going to need additional relief or not. So what we have been doing on both the wholesale and the consumer side, we\u2019ve marshaled substantial resources. But we\u2019re actually reaching out to these borrowers, whether they\u2019re individuals or whether they\u2019re businesses and trying to anticipate what they think their needs are, or what their current financial situation and outlook is, so that we can get a sense of what lies ahead. And I can just tell you, it depends on the individual situations we\u2019re seeing anywhere from 0% ask \u2013 think they\u2019ll need another accommodation to some asset classes. It might be 50%. So we\u2019re trying to take all that into consideration, be compliant with the CARES Act. But we\u2019re going to be much more thoughtful about the second wave to make sure that we\u2019re not kicking the can down the road. And so, as we\u2019re doing these reviews, we\u2019re also effectively, where it\u2019s appropriate, deferring the interest accrual. And Daryl talked about that. We\u2019re actually \u2013 got reserve there, if we think there\u2019s higher probability of re-default. And then, we\u2019re also, through this re-grading, that\u2019s definitely included in our modeling in our loan loss reserves. Betsy Graseck : Okay, thanks. And on the fee waiver side, is that something that will sunset at some point? Kelly King : Yes. So basically on the fee waivers, we think it\u2019s about time to kind of eliminate those. To be honest, we had lot of discussion about it. But we\u2019ve concluded that we got to let our clients ease back into normal life planning and financial planning. And so we\u2019ve terminated that. Christopher Henson : Yeah, Betsy, this is Chris. I would add, under Truist Cares, we did things like 5% cashback for grocery and pharmacy, ATM fees for waivers for clients and non-clients. We did for the EIP, a 30-day relief credit for those who did not have balances. And so, all those things to the point I think Kelly and Daryl making, we\u2019ll come back to is, we\u2019ve also had some service charge, bank card, check card challenges, which will come back, at least certainly a large portion of that will come back in 2021 as well. Betsy Graseck : Okay. So this should be over starting in 3Q into 4Q, and really full run rate by 1Q 2021 type of concept. Is that, that\u2019s what I\u2019m hearing. Christopher Henson : Okay. It\u2019s certainly up full run rate in 2020, yeah. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Kelly King : Yeah. Betsy Graseck : All right. Thank you very much. Kelly King : Thanks, Betsy. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Good morning. Kelly King : Good morning. John Pancari : Good morning. On the core NIM, I know, Daryl, you mentioned that the core NIM should be up modestly in the third quarter. Can you just discuss what the drivers of that would be and if you would expect similar moderate expansion quarterly thereafter on the core side? Thanks. Daryl Bible : Yeah, so, John, we\u2019re doing several things around that. Obviously, you saw us exit $20 million of advances from the Home Loan Bank. They had rates north of 1%. We eliminated the negative carry that we had at the Fed at earning 10 basis points. So that was an immediate lift to run rate that\u2019s happening as we speak now. Kelly touched on earlier; we\u2019re continuingly have opportunity to continue to cut our core deposit rates. We think that will come down substantially over the next 2 quarters. So we feel good about that. If you look at on the commercial area, 75% of all new originations and modifications, got floors embedded into their loans. We think that will protect some of the yield from that perspective. And the other things we\u2019re looking at right now, it\u2019s kind of tricky on what assets you can grow, at this time that helps run rate and capital. But there are strategies like the Ginnie Mae buyout program, where we are adding to that. We\u2019re looking at maybe adding back our jumbo correspondent production that will add more earning assets there, 90% LTV, so you still have favorable risk weights, the student lending that\u2019s government guaranteed. So all those are capital friendly that help run rate will be positive. We\u2019re also looking at moving some of the mix out of the Fed balance into the investment portfolio to some extent. So all those I think will increase our core margin, which will help offset the slowdown as you have your reported margin. You have less fair value accounting coming through every quarter. We\u2019re trying to offset that with all these actions that we\u2019re taking so we can keep our margin flat. John Pancari : Okay, good. All right. That\u2019s helpful. And then, on the, I guess, I\u2019d say on the expense side, I mean, first, I know you indicated that you push back the core systems conversion. And you cited some vendor disruptions. Have you chosen a vendor for the core systems and will you be announcing that? And then, separately on the efficiency side, on the medium-term targets of the low 50%s, just want to see like, how much higher do rates need to be to make that a reality? And what type of timeframe, I guess? Thanks. Kelly King : So, on the conversion we have a full plan developed. We have timelines developed. We have all the parties lined up in terms of executing. And as I said, we\u2019re executing literally as we speak in terms of non-core bank conversions. But for the core bank, all of that is lined up and moving forward. It\u2019s a big deal, so it\u2019s challenging. But we\u2019re very confident in terms of moving forward in the timeline we\u2019ve talked about. And Daryl can comment, but with regard to the efficiency ratio, you\u2019ve heard me say over the years. That\u2019s just a tough ratio, because you got a numerator and a denominator. But look we\u2019re at 55.8% in adjusted in this environment, without getting the benefits of the expense cuts from the conversion materially and the revenue enhancements. So that\u2019s why we feel very, very confident getting into low-50s from where we are today. The adjusted efficiency ratio will wash out to the normal efficiency ratio, because the \u2013 all the merger unusual costs now will go away. And so we feel very confident about that. So that \u2013 even if rates stay relatively low, I\u2019m optimistic we can get down to that kind of level. Obviously, if rates go up, then that really helps. Daryl Bible : Yeah. I mean, the only thing I would add to that, John, is that, no matter what environment we\u2019re in, with putting the 2 companies together in the scale and efficiencies we have, we believe will be a top-tier provider in efficiency in any market condition that you have there. So rates are higher, it will have lower efficiency numbers. If rates stay lower, maybe they won\u2019t be quite as well as what we\u2019re saying, but we still should be in the top couple of our peer group from that perspective. So we feel very good about that. William Rogers : And John, this is Bill. Maybe just \u2013 John, Bill. Just a little clarification maybe on the provider is the vendor disruptions that we\u2019ve had really are on the support and tech side. So our core providers that we\u2019ve selected for all the conversions that we\u2019ve talked about trust and brokerage and deposits, and all those, those are all in great shape, and we\u2019re proceeding well, and so that the challenge has really just been in the tech support. John Pancari : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Bill. William Rogers : Okay. Operator : All right. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rose with Raymond James. Michael Rose : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Kelly King : Good morning. Michael Rose : Just wanted to dig on some of the fee income businesses. Obviously, insurance was very strong. I think last quarter you got it about 3% year-on-year. Can you give some color there? And just maybe if you\u2019d expect any momentum to continue on the high banking trading side? Thanks. Christopher Henson : Sure. Happy to, Mike. This is Chris. Yeah, really excited about the quarter. It was a record quarter, as Kelly alluded to earlier. And the three drivers of organic growth was pricing and retention of new business. And so the \u2013 prior to COVID, they were all kind of hitting all cylinders, and what you have now as new businesses driven by GDP and uncertainty due to COVID tailing down a bit. But pricing is really robust. So what we had in the quarter was pricing last quarter was up in the 4.5% range closer to 5% this quarter. As anticipate, we\u2019ll continue to see acceleration for the remainder of this year and into 2021, I\u2019ll touch on why in just a minute. Client retention was, in retail, 90.3%, 84.1% in wholesale, also very strong, but what you\u2019re seeing there is a bit of a shift with the COVID uncertainties. You\u2019re beginning to see some of the standard carriers that support retail to really sort of pull back and refer to wholesale, which gets underwritten in the E&S market that supports the wholesale. So over a period of a year, you\u2019re seeing a little bit of \u2013 maybe a couple of percent down in retail, but up about 4% at wholesale. And that really underscores sort of the power of our diversified model, because we play in both channels. In fact, in wholesale, you might even get just to touch on margin in today\u2019s world, so that we actually benefit in that situation. New business production, where we were up maybe double digits last quarter, we\u2019re down 4%. But what I would say there is, while \u2013 and that\u2019s really driven by GDP, what\u2019s going on in the economy, uncertainty due to COVID. But I would tell you that overall outlook is much more positive, because of the price firming I just talked about. And we also saw in the quarter more stable exposure units than we\u2019d expect. We just did not see the business failures. It was just a limited number of business failures and also the growing excess and surplus lines volume, the shift from retail to wholesale that I had commented on just a minute. So in the quarter what all that gave us was organic growth in the 2.1% range. I think what I had said was sort of a flat to 2%, and we were right on the upper end of that range. So I felt very, very good about it in a market that I think some might would have expected flat to slightly down. Just another touch on pricing. You really are seeing upward momentum. I think we\u2019re going to continue to see all coverage types were up, except workers comp. All sizes were up at least in the sort of 4.5%, 5.5% range. You saw things like D&O up 9.3%, liability \u2013 professional liability up, 6%, 7%, business interruption up 6%. I mean, those are big numbers. So what we would expect in the third quarter, because of what Daryl had said earlier, was our \u2013 we\u2019re going out \u2013 we\u2019re coming out of the second quarter, which is our strongest quarter of the year to our weakest quarter of the year, the third quarter, which is purely seasonal. So you\u2019ll see something down in the 13%, 14% range. But for the year, we\u2019re still forecasting organic growth, what would be soft in third and fourth quarter. We\u2019re still seeing it in low-single-digits for the remainder of 2020 was really pricing sort of leading the way. So we feel really strong, really good about it. William Rogers : This is Bill. I\u2019ll take the investment banking and trading side. We had a good quarter on investment banking. Things that we want to see, equity origination, investment grade were all really strong. I think, as Kelly noted, it really is highlighting the value of the franchise. And I felt really good about the relationships with commercial community bank and the pipelines that we\u2019re building and the dialogues that we\u2019re having with clients. All that being said, it\u2019s hard to predict quarter-to-quarter, just because there\u2019s just more volatility and there\u2019s some market dependency, but overall momentum in that business, I think it\u2019s just a real strength of the Truist merger. On the trading side, we just have a lower risk, client driven trading business that just has lower betas than these other businesses. So our core trading business was good in the areas of \u2013 that we wanted to be good in derivatives market trading again value the franchise, value of the relationships, taxable fixed income sales and trading. And the real difference was the CVA recognition was just much lower in this quarter that was last quarter and presuming the rate environment and credit environment that\u2019s stable that could continue. So just really good long-term momentum quarter-to-quarter, a little harder to predict. Christopher Henson : And Mike, it\u2019s Chris, again. I might just comment on mortgage. We had, as Kelly alluded to just an exceptional mortgage quarter this quarter. And Daryl said that we might expect it to tail down and touch I will tell you production, we think is going to be just as strong, maybe even a little stronger. It\u2019s just as the industry brings on more capacity, the margin is going to tail down to touch. So I mean, we\u2019re in a 319 kind of range this quarter, and that combines retail at 450 and correspondent a touch lower. But you\u2019re still going to probably have in the mid- to upper-2s, kind of margin. And you got additional servicing costs as Daryl pointed out, but still going to be a very strong year. I mean, the kind of year that would have been, frankly, I mean, kind of quarter, it would have been a year to the old BB&T. So very substantial kind of numbers overall. Michael Rose : Very, very helpful. Just one follow-up question. Exclude the items that you called out for noninterest expense on a core basis, it looks like expenses were $3.3 billion. Given the pull forward, some of the cost savings and mobile incentive comp, is it safe to assume that expenses would be down in the third quarter? Thanks. Daryl Bible : Yeah. So my prepared remarks, Mike, I said that we\u2019d be down 1% to 3% linked-quarter on excluding those items that I mentioned there. So we definitely believe it\u2019s going to have a [two or three] [ph] down third quarter and probably pretty good in the fourth quarter as well. Michael Rose : Sorry, I missed that. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : All right. Your next question comes from Dave Rochester with Compass Point. David Rochester : Hey, good morning, guys. Kelly King : Good morning. Daryl Bible : Good morning. David Rochester : On your \u2013 just like on the margin, I appreciate your comments on the drivers going forward. I was just wondering what your assumptions were for the curve, the premium amortization there? And then on your opportunity to lower deposit costs, if you\u2019re assuming you can sort of hit that pre cycle low for the cost? Or if you\u2019re thinking you could actually take those even lower given all the liquidity you have, which would seem like a fairly reasonable assumption? Daryl Bible : Yeah. So what I would tell you is, is that we\u2019re at 32 basis points right now. If you look that what our average in June was, we were at 25 basis points. So we will probably be in the low-20s maybe peers through 20% \u2013 or 20 basis points in the third quarter probably by fourth quarter will be in the teens. On heritage BB&T side, the lowest we got in the last crisis was 20 basis points. I don\u2019t have with me what heritage SunTrust was handy. But we\u2019re clearly headed lower. I think we\u2019re going to be lower than before. The assumptions on the margin outlook, we basically use the forward curve, forward curve basically has no rate movements for the next couple of years, a pretty flat curve. So we are not anticipating any increase. We\u2019re just trying to take actions that we think are prudent that we can take in the stressed environment to help improve core margin, which would help alleviate some of the offset of the fair value accounting accretion well. David Rochester : Any help on reduced securities premium and going forward? Or should that stay elevate? Daryl Bible : Yeah, we always tend to buy securities with 2% premium or less that\u2019s we\u2019ve done that for many, many years, because we don\u2019t like that to have a lot of leap year volatility. But you\u2019re seeing CPRs and the marketplace now of 30%, so they\u2019re prepaying pretty fast. If you look at our investment portfolio or in the mid- to high-$70 billion range, our cash flow is coming off are about $4.5 billion to $5 billion a quarter right now. So you\u2019re getting some of that amortization that we\u2019re seeing there. So we\u2019re reloading and trying to add to it. But it\u2019s hard to find security they don\u2019t have a big premium. So we\u2019re being as selective as we can from that perspective. David Rochester : Are you seeing other opportunities to move the needle with more FHLB paydowns? Daryl Bible : We are almost all out of Federal Home Loan Bank paydowns. I think we have $1 billion left or whatever that\u2019s going to roll off, I think, for later this year. So if we were to do anything right now, I\u2019m not saying we would, but the only thing left you can really do from a liability perspective is tender any outstanding debt. We have not made a decision to do any of that. But that\u2019s the only thing left. And then, as we aggressively push down deposit rates, we will be good to our clients. But non-clients, we\u2019re going to push them down really, really low. And if they leave, that\u2019s okay, because we have huge balances at the Fed. David Rochester : Great. And then maybe just one \u2013 switching to credit. You had some acceleration of pandemic in your markets. Did you guys make any overlays in your CECL process for that? And what that can mean for the reserving next quarter? If you see that accelerate? Are you already assuming that your base case that will get further acceleration? Clarke Starnes : Hey, Dave, this is Clarke. We did consider that and as we\u2019ve gone through, I mentioned these deep dive reviews by segments that would include geographies as well, and even things like individual property levels and submarkets. So we have considered that and tried to take that into consideration in our estimates, which obviously did assume further deterioration. David Rochester : Great. And then just maybe as a last follow-up to that. What are you guys hearing for business customers on the ground on how they\u2019re feeling about the pandemic in the background? And is there any outsize caution there? Does it mean more deposit growth and less loan growth going forward? Just any thoughts there would be great. Daryl Bible : So from what we\u2019re hearing from clients, I would say, a pandemic-wise. Our clients \u2013 for the most part, our small business clients are probably the ones most impacted right now, because they don\u2019t have the same reserves that larger companies do. So larger companies depending on what scenarios you\u2019re in, some are under stress, some are actually doing really well. It\u2019s a really broad spectrum there from that perspective. From a cards perspective and the team, they\u2019ve been actively grading down the more stress credit. So you\u2019re seeing that reflected, and that\u2019s showing up in our allowance numbers on that. But from a deposit, we have huge deposit growth. The DDA growth that we got, the $20 billion that Kelly mentioned 80% of that was coming from businesses that will probably moderate over time. And if you look at the growth that we\u2019ve gotten from our interest checking and MMDA, most of that is coming from personal. I think that will also get spent and moderate over time. It all depends on the government comes out with more stimulus checks, then that might add back to the balances there. Kelly King : Yeah. One of the interesting things that we\u2019re finding, but I must admit I was a little bit positively surprised about is the resiliency of our clients, when we talked to our regional presidents and our people that are dealing direct with clients. In many, many cases, they\u2019re saying, well, the clients feel pretty good given the environment and the reason is because they learned their lesson 10 years ago in the Great Recession. And when this hit, they acted fast. They held their expenses. They tried to be creative in terms of generating other revenues. And they\u2019re hanging on much, much better than I might have expected. Now they\u2019re \u2013 some of the tiniest, micros all businesses are having the hardest time because they don\u2019t any rainy-day funds. They live kind of day to day. But for most of our small business clients, they have some resiliency, but mostly they responded very fast. So now if it hangs on a long time, it\u2019s just going to be hard. But if this recovers reasonably quickly, I think we may be pleasantly surprised at how well our business community actually [recovers] [ph]. Christopher Henson : And this is Chris, Kelly. Just to reinforce your point over half of our 24 regions are actually on goal for lending business to date. And what\u2019s really good to see is to the top regions or like West Virginia and Virginia West, some of our core \u2013 corest of core regions. And so I absolutely agree with what you\u2019re saying. Operator : All right. Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Amanda Larsen : Hey, guys. This is Amanda Larsen on for Ken. You mentioned that the COVID-19 related deferred interest reducing NIM by 5 basis points? Was that just accounting? Or was that a choice that you guys made for prudence to not accrue interest on customers that are experiencing duress? Daryl Bible : Yeah. So just based on our prior experience, Amanda in the last crisis, we know that some of the people that are on payment deferral are going to end up in charge-off. And we don\u2019t want to have any surprises. So we\u2019re using a lot of metrics depending portfolio specific on which percentages people will carry through and might not be able to make their payments, and it varies by each portfolio. But this quarter was around $50 million for us. And that\u2019s what we backed out of our net interest income from accrual basis. So we did a little bit in the first quarter, and we\u2019re continuing to manage and monitor that, but we think it\u2019s prudent accounting just to basically make sure that we are going to accrue what we think we\u2019re going get paid back on. Amanda Larsen : Okay, great. And then separate question, can you provide updated thoughts on the capital stack, you guys issued $2.5 billion of preferred, bringing your preferred-to-ROAs up to like 185%. Do you expect to continue to run with this bucket kind of oversized relative to 1.5% sort of optimization level? Like what\u2019s your thought process here? And how does it tie in with the strategy of the overall funding base? Daryl Bible : Yeah. So Amanda, we\u2019re just taking it day by day and as we know certain things. So right now, we\u2019re still in a stressed period. So we\u2019re going to keep our capital stack pretty strong. We do have the ability to call some of the preferred out over the next year or two, if things were to lighten up. That would be about $1.5 billion or so. But right now, I think we want to keep our capital really strong. We continue to evaluate and make sure that we have enough. We\u2019re managing the capital for stress and what could come our way from that perspective. But we have a lot of flexibility. And we will make prudent decisions, and we\u2019ll let you know when we make those decisions right now. But right now, we\u2019re happy with the capital that we have. Amanda Larsen : Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Daryl Bible : Yeah. Operator : All right. Next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Just one follow-up question, if I may. As you think about $5.7 billion in terms of your loan loss reserve, are \u2013 is the majority \u2013 is reserve building behind you? Clarke Starnes : Erika, this is Clarke. Obviously, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard this from others, we follow our process, we look at our models, our economic scenario assumptions, our client behaviors, and the deep dives around these specific industries, and we do everything we can in the CECL process to estimate what we think those lifetime losses are. So obviously, if those scenarios play out differently, our clients perform differently than we had forecasted, then that would adjust what we would need to do in the future. So for now, we think we\u2019ve done the very best estimate we can with the information that we\u2019ve been able to evaluate Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you. Operator : All right. Next question will be from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Kelly, and good morning, Daryl. Daryl Bible : Good morning. Kelly King : Hi, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Clarke, can you share with us? When you look at the portfolio today, and I know this is going to take some guesswork, but 18 months from now when we\u2019re finally through this crisis, do you think the greater credit losses may show up in the consumer side of the house or the commercial side? And when I think of commercial, where in the commercial side of the house are you seeing greater stress? Is it commercial real estate? Clarke Starnes : It\u2019s a great question, Gerard, and we debate that every day. Certainly, for us right now, while we\u2019re concerned about the consumer, we\u2019re watching it very closely with all the stimulus support and the savings and different things. It\u2019s holding up relatively well, even if you take out the forbearance benefit that we\u2019ve provided. I think our concern right now is more in the commercial side. If you look at our reserve allocation, to even again for this quarter, it was 80% plus on the wholesale side. So I think that\u2019s what \u2013 we\u2019re looking at things like, what does \u2013 how does the hospitality or some of these sensitive areas; are there structural changes in office or other property types? So I think the wholesale side, based on various certain industry segments and CRE types are where we\u2019re putting most of our focus right now. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Daryl, when we looked at the DFAST results, it seemed like your results weren\u2019t as strong as they should have been in PPNR and even some of the credit losses. Is there any way of addressing that with the Fed or you just really have to just take what they give you and just work your way through it? Daryl Bible : Gerard, we did do a press release earlier that week, when \u2013 after the numbers came out on Thursday. We said that we thought potentially that our numbers on provision, we thought should have been a little bit lower. It\u2019s hard to know, when you\u2019re doing current method, you have to really know when the loans come off first, and when they stay on the books, and to know when it has to get reloaded with the new originations. And you don\u2019t have that data; I think it\u2019s hard to actually forecast that. I think in their model, methodology, they say they try to account for it, but you really need to have good instruments in forecasting, to know what loans are coming on and off. Then on fair value accounting, if you have PPNR models that are based upon historical results, this was probably the worst time you could model PPNR, because the company just came together in December. We had maybe three weeks of purchase accounting, so you really didn\u2019t have anything. You did have one year of noninterest expense. And that appropriately got loaded into our run rate. And we\u2019re going to have that for the next year or two, and that will fade away. But fair value accounting is real, it\u2019s alive. I mean, we had over almost $1 billion in the first twp quarters of this year that we basically were able to use that from an earnings perspective. And we kind of think of it that it kind of helped fund our allowance though. It wasn\u2019t exact, but it was like 90%-plus what the amount was. It just happened that way, but didn\u2019t really have any earnings impact off of our core earnings because of that. So we feel over time that our history will be loaded with fair value accounting. And that will get done appropriately. We are actively meeting with the Fed. They\u2019re here, as you know, constantly and we\u2019re giving them all the information, sharing everything that we have. And we hope down the road that we will get better results. And we still think long term, our MOE, we should be top-tier performing, not just on the loss rate, but also on the PPNR and on the capital resiliency. It might take two or three years to get the expenses out of our run rate. But hopefully, by year three from now, we\u2019re going to be in the top quartile or, if not, the best in our peer group. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Operator : All right, next question comes from Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Brian Klock : Hey, good morning, gentlemen. Daryl Bible : Good morning. Kelly King : Good morning. Brian Klock : Hey, and then thanks for going over the hour and then taking my question. Just a real quick credit follow-up for Clarke, I guess, can you talk about the reserve build for the second quarter? And kind of how much of that could be related to either the downgrades that you mentioned earlier? And then, maybe you can talk about the change in criticized assets quarter-over-quarter too, please. Clarke Starnes : It\u2019s a great question. You\u2019ll see our C&C asse4ts when we file the Q. But I mentioned this deep-dive and re-grading process we went through. So effectively on the wholesale side, we\u2019ve actually in the sensitive industry areas, we\u2019ve done deep dives. As an example, in the hospitality area, we covered 90% of our total exposure there on a borrower-by-borrower basis and re-enter every one of those. And done that similar process for the other sensitive industries and then for any client this had an accommodation. And so, we\u2019ve marshaled a ton of people to do that. And so we\u2019re getting real-time information. That has certainly impacted our grading. And so, we proactively downgraded a good number of credits. The biggest stress we\u2019ve seen in the downgrades has been in hospitality and things like CRE and retail. So, all of that is baked into our second quarter estimate. And as I mentioned, about 80% plus of the additional increase is related to those, the wholesale and particularly to those sensitive industry areas. Brian Klock : That\u2019s great color. Thanks for your time, guys. Clarke Starnes : Thanks. Operator : All right. We\u2019ll next go to Christopher Marinac with Janney Montgomery Scott. Christopher Marinac : Thanks. Just a quick one for Darryl on the PPP forgiveness, is that something that you can kind of have a certainty about in terms of how it might impact year-end and first part of next year? Daryl Bible : I can tell you our assumptions, Chris. This is, obviously, a new product, and we\u2019ll see how it all plays out. But if you look at the fees, obviously, we set them up on the loan system. And they get amortized to go over a two-year time period. But as they get the forgiveness and then get paid back, all that left accretion to that loan would actually come into earnings in that time period. So our assumptions are that, we believe 75% of our production in PPP will get forgiveness. We believe that, this is the timing that we put in our models. In the fourth quarter, 30% of the 75% will get forgiven, 65% of the 70% will get forgiven in the first quarter of 2021, and then the remaining 5% of the 75% in quarter two of 2021. The other 25%, we think will go all the way to term and from that perspective. That\u2019s our estimate. It\u2019s our best guess, they did modify it. So we pushed out a little bit. PPP is very fluid. It tends to change a lot. So we\u2019ll see how things would react. But this is our best estimate right now. Christopher Marinac : Got it. And that will impact the margin when it happens. But I imagine you break that out. So would this be a onetime event in each of those quarters? Daryl Bible : Yeah, we\u2019ll mention it. I mean, it\u2019s in our run rate now a little bit, because you\u2019re still amortizing, basically, the fee over that two-year time period. So like for this quarter, it was worth about $49 million of our net interest income for the second quarter. Christopher Marinac : Okay, great. Well, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much, guys. Daryl Bible : Thank you. You have a great day. Operator : And at this time, it looks like we have no further time for questions. So I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Ryan for any additional or closing remarks. Ryan Richards : Thank you, Alan, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I apologize to those with questions we didn\u2019t have time to get to. We will certainly reach out to you later today. And we wish you all the best. Goodbye. Operator : That does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank everyone again for their participation.",

Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Ryan Richards, Director of Investor Relations for Truist Financial Corporation. Ryan Richards : Thank you, Vijay, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. On today's call, our Chairman and CEO, Kelly King; and our CFO, Daryl Bible will review our third quarter results and provide some thoughts for the fourth quarter of 2020. We also have Bill Rogers, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Chris Henson, our Head of Banking and Insurance; and Clarke Starnes, our Chief Risk Officer, to participate in the Q&A session.

Good morning, everybody. I really appreciate you all joining our call. And I hope you and your family are doing well. Now, I would say, relative to the challenges that we're all facing, we're really happy to report what I call a great quarter, strong balance sheet, particularly an asset quality, liquidity and capital, relatively strong earnings, great value proposition for our clients, particularly in our digital offerings, great team, which I am extraordinarily proud of and a strong commitment to our communities and other stakeholders. We are, as you know, from our previous conversations, really focused on our culture, especially our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities. And I want to show on slide 5, a few of the things we're doing to live out our purpose. So, we announced recently something we're very excited about a $40 million donation to help establish an organization called CornerSquare Community Capital. This is a new organization that will be focusing on funding to racially and ethnically diverse small business owners, women and individuals, and LMI communities. This will be done through CDFIs, community development financial institutions, and it's a very exciting opportunity to get funds exactly where they're needed. We're real proud of our first Truist CSR report. I hope you've had a chance to read it. We launched recently, our Truist Momentum, which is continuation of a SunTrust program that focuses on financial wellbeing. We partnered with EverFi to introduce -- this is something we're very excited about a game called WORD Force, which helps kids in K-2, learn how to read. You've heard me say in the past, unfortunately, in our country today, two thirds of the kids in the public school system in the third grade cannot read. This is a way of getting at that. It may not be the all-in answer, but it's a really good start. We're excited about it. We're in our beta test, but we already have over 4,000 students and over 200 schools participating. We are doing a really good job in terms of conservation of energy, water and making good progress on a number of areas like that, investing in those areas to make our climate and our environment better. We did, as you know, announce as part of the merger, our $60 billion Community Benefits Plan over the next three years. We're very excited about that. As you can see on the slide, a number of areas that we're really committed to. I would particularly point out that we will be investing in loans and/or investments $32 billion over the next three years in home purchase mortgage loans and to LMI and minority borrowers. So, this is a big part of helping to deal with some of the social injustice and racial inequity problems that we have in our country, and a number of other programs that you can see there. I would also point out that we are committed at the executive level to improving our diversity. We said in our CSR report that we have committed, over the next three years to improve our senior leadership diversity from 12% in 2019 to 15%. You can see there that we have a very good and effective diverse Board with 45% being women and minorities. So, we feel really good about that. I'd also point out we were honored to receive a perfect score of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2020 Corporate Equality Index. So, we're doing a really good job with regard to living our purpose. If you look at slide 6, I\u2019d just point out a few highlights, we did have taxable equivalent revenue of $5.6 billion. Net income available to common shareholders of $1 billion, but adjusted net income available to common was $1.3 billion. That resulted in diluting earnings per share on adjusted of $0.97. Return on average tangible common equity adjusted was 16.0%, very strong, and a really good efficiency ratio adjusted at 57.3%. We were really pleased about our nonperforming assets at 0.26%. And we recognize that there's more to come with regard to credit quality deterioration, depending on what happens with regard to the economy. But still, given where we are today and recognizing there are some positive impacts with regard to accommodations there, that's a really good number. We feel really good about that. And likewise, our net charge-offs were 0.42%, at the low end of what we had talked about. We're very pleased that our common equity Tier 1 is now at 10%. So, we feel really good about our capital position. If you look at some selective items on slide 7, I\u2019d just point out we did have security gains of $104 million, which was a positive $0.06 per share. We had merger and restructuring charges of $236 million, which is $0.13. We did have incremental operating expenses related to the merger. Remember, these are expenses that don't qualify for MRRC [ph] in terms of calling out because they do have future benefits, but they're not a part of our longer term run rate. That was $152 million, and that was $0.08. And we did make a $50 million unusual contribution to our charitable foundation, and that was $0.03. So, if you put all that together, it was a negative impact to EPS of about $0.18. So, we feel good about the adjusted number because of the quality of these selected items. On slide eight, just a couple of comments with regard to loans. As you all know, loans are a real challenge for us and for the industry now because of what's going on in the economy. Of course, we did see a big run-up in loans in the second quarter. And likewise, we saw a big rundown in loans into third, as a large number of the corporate line draw-downs were repaid. So, we saw total loan reductions of $11 billion. $9.5 billion of that was in the C&I area. So, that's principally what happened. We did have some bright spots. We had growth in LightStream, our national consumer digital platform. Sheffield had a growth, recreational lending, prime auto. We did have some decreases in some other consumer areas, like resi mortgage and so forth. So, it's kind of a mixed bag with regard to consumer. But overall, the big story in loans is, if you exclude the run-up in balances in the second and the run-down in the third was relative flat. I would say to you that we do expect future headwinds. With regard to the PPP loans, we have about $12.5 billion there. That will begin to pay off as we head into the fourth and the first and probably the second. Loan growth is really challenging now, obviously. But, banks are a reflection of the economy. And so, we should not be surprised about that. The real question is what's going to happen to the economy. I would just point out, and this is just one person's opinion. It's important to look back at previous corrections that we've had. And there's virtually all ways of material precipitating event. So, in 1991, we had the commercial real estate bubble; 2001, we had the technology bubble; 2008, we had the residential real estate bubble; this one didn't have a bubble. This was a very strong 10-year economy, 3.5% unemployment rate. We just shut it down, appropriately so for medical reasons, but we shut it down. I'll make that point to say that if this pandemic doesn't go on too much longer, there's a chance that we can get a snap back in the economy that most people would not expect, because it wasn't structurally in trouble to start with. Now, if it stays on a long time, then all bets are off. I personally believe, as we head into the first quarter, we'll begin to see some real developments with regard to bank names. We certainly have already had substantial developments, positive developments with regard to medical -- mitigation of ramification. So, we are somewhat optimistic, although cautious, as we think about the economy going forward. I will tell you, as I get feedback from our client-facing people, while they're not facing them in person as much today, we're talking to people more probably than we ever did now, although virtually. David Weaver, who runs our Commercial Community Bank, told me the other day, he had nine calls in one day. So, we've been very, very efficient. But to his point, clients are being very resilient. I'm speaking particularly of middle and upper market. One of the quotes that I got recently was clients to say, it's time to move on. And to be honest, that's kind of what we said. We set back for a while and didn't make virtual calls and said we were waiting for the pandemic. And then several months ago, we just kind of said, we got to get on with running our business because our clients need us. So, our clients are being today is there saying kind of my business is okay. Now, the small -- very small micro end is struggling. And depending on how long this lasts, we will see a substantial shakeout in the small business, micro market. At the aggregate economic level, that will reshuffle and reallocate itself. But at a personal level for those small business people, that's a very sad story. So, we've got to hope that this moves along as rapidly as possible. I'll say finally that our pipelines are improving. Our calling activity is robust. And we feel very good about where we're going relative to what happens to the economy. On slide 9, just a brief comment about deposits, which are doing great. We continue to have a nice inflow, somewhat because of the flight to quality. We had $1.4 billion increase in deposits on a linked-quarter basis. We had a $10 billion increase following other previous quarter increases in noninterest-bearing deposits. So, we feel really good about that. Our noninterest-bearing deposits today are 33.3% of total deposits versus 27.8% in the first quarter. So, you can see how rapidly our DDA or noninterest-bearing deposits have increased. We've been focusing a lot of attention with regard to getting our cost down, with regard to our deposit structure. And we've made really good progress. Our total deposit costs decreased from 12 basis points to 10 basis points. Average interest-bearing deposits decreased 17 basis points, down to 15 basis points. So, really good progress in managing our cost of deposits. I would point out, if you\u2019re following the math and all of our deposit activity there, we did divest $2.2 billion in deposits this quarter. And so, that's a material factor. So overall, I would say our deposits are doing great. With that, let me turn it to Daryl for some more detail. Daryl Bible : Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I want to cover highlights from the third quarter and provide our fourth quarter outlook. Turning to slide 10. Reported net interest margin decreased 3 basis points, primarily due to lower purchase accounting accretion. Core net interest margin increased 5 basis points, the first increase since the first quarter of 2019. Core margin benefited from strong DDA growth, lower funding costs, lower COVID-related deferred interest. Lower yields on loans and securities remain a headwind. During the quarter, we used excess reserves to purchase $5 billion of high-quality securities, improving our yield on those assets by approximately 100 basis points. Our asset sensitivity increased in the third quarter, and we plan to stay slightly asset sensitive. We will continue to protect our margin by placing rate floors on commercial loans and manage deposit costs. Due to our excess funding position, we are being strategic about deposit costs by focusing on growing noninterest-bearing deposits. Given the low rate environment, we are placing pay fixed swaps to partially hedge our investment securities and associated changes in OCI. We expect the reported net interest margin to slightly decrease for the remainder of the year. Turning to slide 11. Adjusted noninterest income was relatively flat versus a robust second quarter. Fee income categories impacted by the pandemic continued to improve. Our activity on deposits is normalizing, coupled with lower fee waivers. Card and payment-related fees increased as payment volumes improved. Wealth management income increased as a result of higher market valuations. Despite the seasonally weak quarter, insurance income grew 6.4% on a like-quarter basis due to firmer pricing and an uptick in new business. Residential mortgage income decreased, primarily due to a $72 million change in the net MSR valuation, driven by higher prepayments. Investment banking had a record quarter, but trading was off from a great second quarter, resulting in lower revenue. Other income increased due to the increase in the value of nonqualified plan assets and other investments. Turning to slide 12. Noninterest expense decreased $123 million as losses on debt extinguishment and higher intangible amortization during the second quarter were partially offset by higher merger-related costs and a charitable contribution. Adjusted noninterest expense increased $20 million, primarily due to an increased personnel expense, marketing costs and professional services. The increase in personnel expense reflects higher nonqualified plan costs that were offset by other income, higher medical costs due to normalization, pension cost adjustment and a reduced labor cost capitalization due to lower loan volume. Truist remains highly disciplined on core expenses. Average FTEs decreased 769 during the quarter, and we expect further reductions this year. We plan to close 104 branches in December and January and are looking at ways to bring forward more branch closures in 2021. Turning to slide 13. Asset quality ratios remained relatively stable. The NPA ratio increased 1 basis point to 26 basis points, and the NPL ratio increased 2 basis points to 37 basis points, primarily due to C&I loans. Annualized net charge-offs relative to average loans and leases increased 3 basis points to 42 basis points. We took a $97 million PCD adjustment to net charge-offs. Excluding that, net charge-offs would have been 29 basis points. The provision of $421 million exceeded net charge-offs of $326 million, increasing an allowance by $95 million. The allowance was 1.91% of loans and leases, up from 1.81%. Coverage ratios remained strong at 4.52 times net charge-offs and 2 -- 5.22 times nonperforming loans. The combination of our allowance and unamortized fair value work remains very robust at 2.76% of total loans. Turning to slide 14. Our exposure to sensitive industries continues to decline to a low of 9.1% of loans held for investment. Outstanding balances to sensitive industries decreased $2.2 billion to $27.9 billion. We continue to closely monitor and manage our sensitive industry portfolios. Turning to slide 15. The volume of loans with the accommodations have decreased significantly since June 30th. Approximately $692 million of commercial loans had an active activation at the end of September 30, down from $21.2 billion. In consumer, $6.2 billion had active accommodation, down from $11.3 billion. The declines reflect expiration of the initial payment relief, which was not renewed by the borrower. Since June 30th, approximately 98% of the commercial borrowers and 94.5% of the consumer borrowers who exited payment relief, either paid off their balance or are in current status. Turning to slide 16. The allowance for credit losses increased $96 million to reflect loan re-grading uncertainty related to the expiration of government stimulus programs. Our economic assumptions include extended GDP recovery, high-single-digit unemployment through mid-2021, followed by continued improvement through the remaining reasonable and supportable forecast period. Our ACL estimates also reflect qualitative adjustments for model limitations, government stimulus, accommodation and the review of SNC. Turning to slide 17. Capital ratios improved for the second straight quarter and are strong relative to regulatory requirements. Our reported CET1 ratio increased to 10% from 9.7% last quarter. We also issued $925 million of preferred stock to strengthen our Tier 1 and total capital ratios. The recent assigned stress capital buffer of 270 basis points remained in effect until September when a revised stress capital buffer will be provided. We plan to submit our capital plan in early November as required by the Federal Reserve. Our purpose of capital priorities continues to be organic growth and our dividend. We remain open to bolt-on acquisitions with fee income businesses. Turning to slide 18. Liquidity remains strong with an LCR ratio of 117% and liquid asset buffer of 18.6%. Our access to secured funding sources is robust with over $200 billion of cash, securities and secured borrowings. Parent company is sufficient to cover 22 months of contractual and expected outflows with no inflows. Turning to slide 19. We continue to see strong growth in digital banking. Truist opened up 56,000 net new accounts versus 15,000 last quarter, driven by digital and increased branch traffic. For the 12 months through August, we experienced a 21% increase in digital sales, 8% increase in active mobile users, 23% increase in mobile check deposits and a 5% increase in statement suppression. We are also proud of the recognition we received recently from Javelin. Heritage BB&T was recognized as a leader in ease-of-use and financial fitness in mobile banking and a leader in financial fitness in online banking. Heritage SunTrust was recognized as a leader in ease-of-use and online banking. These awards demonstrate the strength of our heritage platforms and the opportunities as Truist advances digital capabilities. Turning to slide 20. As we have said, our primary reason for the merger is to exceed client expectations through seamless integration of touch and technology to create trust. To get there, we are harvesting cost saves from combined companies to fund increased investment and ultimately drive best-in-class performance. We are fully committed to achieving $1.6 billion in net cost saves and continue to make good progress on personnel expense, corporate real estate, branch rationalization, third-party spend and system decommissioning and data center closures. At the same time, we are also investing in digital, marketing and technology. We are also investing in talent, including areas outside of digital and our revenue businesses. Together, these investments and cost saves will allow us to generate best-in-class returns versus our peers while providing distinctive, secure and successful client experiences through touch and technology. Now, I will provide our fourth quarter guidance, which is based on linked-quarter changes versus the third quarter where our guidance provides a path to positive operating leverage. We expect taxable equivalent revenue, excluding onetime security gains to be down 1% to 3%, driven by lower purchase accounting accretion. We expect reported net interest margin to be down 3 to 5 basis points due to lower purchase accounting accretion and core margin to be relatively flat. Core noninterest expense adjusted for merger costs and amortization is expected to be down 2% to 4%, reflecting lower personnel expense. We also anticipate net charge-offs to between 40 and 60 basis points. Now, let me turn it back to Kelly for a merger update, closing remarks, and Q&A. Kelly King : Thanks, Daryl. If you follow along on slide '21, I would say to you, generally, the merger is on track. Integration and conversion, we feel really good about where we are. We're making really great progress. Most importantly, our culture is really strong. And I would say to you kind of interestingly that the COVID experience has actually bonded our team together even faster than we would have expected, because when you go through a really, really tough time and you\u2019re kind of thrown in the boat together, it encourages our strength in terms of development relationships, trust and bonding. So, we could not feel better about how strong our culture is and how well it is developing. Some very notable activities in terms of the integration and conversion, we did complete the branch divestiture, as I mentioned. We recently announced something we're very excited about, what we call Truist Ventures. This is where we are making relatively small, but important investments in technology platforms that we can build into our value proposition. We are testing now for our client conversion at wealth and mortgage, which will come up in the spring. So, there will be a number of conversions that have occurred or will occur on the way towards the core conversion. We did launch our dual service branch pilots. This is a technical theme, but it's very important as we move down the road, as Daryl alluded to, in terms of accelerating our branch closings as we head into next year. Very importantly, we did complete our end-to-end Truist Securities conversion. This is a big deal. As we know, this is the first virtual conversion that has occurred, and it was seamless. Our people did a fantastic job. And it's a big deal because we are really big securities operation now, backing up our corporate and investment banking business. Core conversion is on track for the first half of '22. So, we feel good about where everything is with regard to integration and conversion. If you look at slide 22, just a word about our value proposition as we wrap up. We are, as I said in the beginning, driven by our purpose, which is to inspire and build better lives and communities. Our goal long term is to grow earnings with less volatility relative to our peers over the long term. That's kind of the commitment we made to our shareholders. We base that on a very exceptional franchise with diverse products, services and markets. As we said, we are the sixth largest commercial bank in the U.S. today that gives us scale to be able to compete. We're very strong in our marketplace, and that gives us the efficiency that we need. We are the sixth largest insurance broker. We have really strong growth there. I think, we're going to report a 5.3% organic growth, which we believe will probably top in the market. We're the number one regional bank on investment firm; we\u2019re the number two regional bank originator -- mortgage originator and servicer. So, very, very strong franchise. We're really positioned well to be best-in-class in terms of efficiency and returns. At the same time, we'll be investing heavily in the future. As Daryl said, we are confident in achieving our $1.6 billion of net cost savings. At the same time, we'll be investing in our revenue synergy operation. I would tell you that our IRM, our integrated relationship management strategy, is going great. As you know, in the beginning, we've said there were huge opportunities to leverage the strength that SunTrust had and the strength BB&T had. And I would say that is ahead of schedule. The receptivity of our people with regard to cross-selling, if you will, these products and services across the organization is robust. And frankly, there's just a lot of enthusiasm about it. We are making key investments in technology, in our teammates, in marketing and in advertising, all of which will drive our above-average organic growth and long term, stable and growing profitability. At the same time, we have a very strong capital base, as you can see, very strong liquidity and a very resilient risk profile. We're very prudent, disciplined in risk in financial management. We have a very conservative risk culture. We have heard diversified benefits arising from the merger that was just kind of naturally implicit in the merger. We've stressed that very well, as you've seen, with very strong capital, very strong liquidity. And we have a very strong and defensive balance sheet, which is insulated by purchase accounting marks, combined with the CECL credit reserve. So, overall, I would say we have a great culture. We have a great franchise. We have a great team. And we fully believe -- I fully believe our best days are ahead. Ryan? Ryan Richards : Thank you, Kelly. Vijay, at this time, will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session? Operator : Sure. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning. Daryl, I wanted to ask you a question on the expense side. Clear that your timing on the cost saves is on track from a long-term perspective. Two pieces. Number one, at what point do we see the incremental operating expenses start to settle back down? They've been on a steady increase since September of last year. And then, two, can you give us any update in terms of your expected realization of those cost saves as we kind of reset the bar in a COVID world and understand, like just your timing recognition of those cost saves? Thanks. Daryl Bible : Yes. So, Ken, what I would tell you is, is that we are still on the uptick in our merger and MOE-related expenses. We are just going through the developing phases of that. Testing starts in the first quarter as we start with kit testing and then we go onto UAT testing as we get ready for client day one in early part of 2022. So, I would say, we're still on the uptick there. To-date, since we announced the transaction in February '19, we have about $1.5 billion of combined MRRC and MOE-related expenses. And at that time, we said we would be at $2 billion. I don't have a number of what it is going yet. We will probably give that to you in January. We will probably exceed that number sometime in the first quarter, the $2 billion number. I want to give you a number and make sure we hit the number that I gave you in our earnings call in January from that standpoint. So, we're coming through figuring all that out, and we'll get back to you on that. But, I would say, we'll still stay elevated for the next several quarters as we -- and we have thousands and thousands of people right now working on hundreds of systems, getting them ready, getting them tested. And we just got to make sure this is flawless. And we have to be -- have a great client experience, we have to make sure everything goes right. It costs a little bit of money. You have to remember, Ken, on this, we chose to choose the better of the two when we had our choices. We didn't take the easy way out and just convert everything all one way or the other. So, for a commercial platform, we chose to use the heritage BB&T servicing system, AFS, coupled with the heritage SunTrust and CNO piece. That takes a lot more time, a lot more complexity. But, when we get it done, we will be so far better. We're doing it in the retail banking platform as well where we have the BB&T heritage deposit system, coupled with heritage SunTrust automated teller. Again, more complexity. But when we get through all this in '22, we will be light years ahead of most of our peers because of what we're doing from that. So, it's the right thing to do. It costs a lot of money to do it. We're going to do it right and we're going to execute. Ken Usdin : Got it. And one long-term question. I know that with the low-20s ROTCE, the outlook that you had previously was pre-COVID. A lot of changes out there. Consensus for '22 is obviously nowhere near it. Can you help us understand, like what you think is doable longer term? Obviously, the provision is a big input into that, or at what point do you think we can get some updated expectations on what's doable for this franchise? Kelly King : So, Ken, we still feel confident over the long term and the original expectation of low 20s ROTCE. Remember, we're already very, very strong in the environment that we're in today. And as Daryl described, we're really just getting started in terms of getting the long-term investment -- investments made and related expense reductions that will follow. And then, of course, you've got all the revenue synergies that I alluded to. So, we are very, very good about that. Obviously, we'll ebb and flow some based on the economy. But, that's still a reasonable number for Q4. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will now take our next question from Michael Rose from Raymond James. Michael Rose : I just wanted to get -- Daryl, I just wanted to get some color on this quarter's PCD review. And then, if you can give us some credit metrics around the kind of the select at-risk exposures. I obviously, saw the balances drop. But, if you can give us any sort of sense on what the migration looked like this quarter in some of those at-risk exposures? Thanks. Daryl Bible : Yes. So, Michael, I'll take the PCD question, then I'll pick to Clarke, and he can maybe answer the accommodation piece of it. So on the PCD, remember, when we closed in December, we closed under the -- now what I would say, old accounting method where we had to set up PCI. When CECL came in into January, we went from PCI to PCD. In that process, we went through -- we grossed up loans and carrying values in connection with the establishment of PCD of our best estimates. As we -- as the year played out, what we realized is we grossed up the loans, and we should have not gross them up to the full value. They should have been today charged off from that perspective. So, it was an adjustment that we made this quarter. We think we've gone through the book, and we've caught everything there. So, in essence, we would have just had a different number in the first quarter when we got our CECL numbers. But, it was an adjustment that we made. It's a noncash item. And we had really good charge-off. If you exclude that $29 million we had good charge-off, even if you add that in, it\u2019s $42 million. Both beat guidance. Clarke Starnes : Clarke? Thanks, Daryl. Hey, Michael. As far as the sensitive entry, you see on the slide there we've got in the deck, we had a nice couple of billion dollar reduction this quarter. It's been a very-targeted effort to work with those borrowers and reduce the exposure. So, I would say the highlights of the quarter there is we worked very aggressively to get a handle on, particularly in the energy portfolio and hospitality side. We actually sold $300 million worth of hotel credits at pretty good pricing and also address good bit of the energy book. So to give you some context, nonperformers in that portfolio of sensitive industries are still less than 100 basis points. And we have less than 2% of those balances there in any kind of accommodation or deferral. So, I consider really strong progress, and we'll continue to watch that closely, and it's all considered in our reserves as well. Michael Rose : Okay. I appreciate that. And maybe just as my follow-up, you guys had 10% CET1. Obviously, buybacks on hold for you and others this quarter. How should we think about capital deployment? Any updated thoughts that you guys have would be appreciated. Kelly King : So, Mike, we're really happy to be at 10%. And as you know, we have said that, that was our target. So, that's a very comfortable position. As we think about it going forward, it's really a function of, of course, when we're actually able to do buybacks and dividend increases. But, the way we think about it is about risk projection. And so, if we look forward and we feel like the economy has stabilized and growing, if we look forward in terms of the pandemic, it's under control, and we can feel comfortable in terms of a projected relatively stable, less volatile, growing revenue streams, then we'll feel comfortable in terms of turning back on buybacks and considering dividend increases. I'd say, today, it's just premature. We just don't know what we don't know. And to go out there today and try to make those kind of assumptions, I think, is shooting in the dark. I do think as we head into next year, we'll see clarity with regard to the pandemic. We'll see clarity with regard to the economy. As I said earlier, I think the chance is that economy will still be better than the most things. So, there's a decent chance we'll have that decision to make as we head into the, let's call it, first half of next year. But today, it's just a tad premature. Operator : We will now take the next question from Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Daryl, can you share with us -- you mentioned that you guys purchased $5 billion of securities using your excess reserves, and you helped the NIM by about a basis point. What's left? I mean, how much more of the excess reserves can you put to work? And, can you also share with us what was the duration of those purchases to be able to get that higher interest margin even though it was only 1 basis point? Daryl Bible : Yes. So, Gerard, so our current duration of our portfolio because of prepayment speeds picked up were just a tad over 3 years right now, 3.1. But, they do have negative convexities. So, it is -- can move in and out from that perspective. What I would say is, that we are in the midst of moving some more of our liquidity that we have -- in fact, we have a little over $30 billion at the Fed. Currently, we are moving that over, some of it this quarter, maybe more of it into early next year. We are layering in some hedges. Now, I would tell you, the hedges that we're putting on are pay fixed hedges. We're buying mortgage back, which as you know, has cash flows that paid out over the life of those assets. The way FASB has approved a hedge accounting on this, it's only allowed to use bullet swaps. They do have a task force that they are working on, trying to look for other ways to allow for this -- it's called last layer of hedging, and we're hopeful that we'll be able to put on a little stronger hedges. But the hedges we're putting on will mute some of the OCI volatility. If they get come through and allow us to use maybe amortizing swaps instead of just bullet swaps, that would significantly improve the performance of those hedges. So, we're hopeful about that. But, we are trying to hedge it the best that we can. Right now the costs of these pay fixed swaps are really low at 12 basis points. So it doesn't really impact it. So, we are in the midst of moving over. I always look at it as an opportunity cost right now. We could have lower rates for the next three years. That's what's in the forecast, five years, you just don't know. And I think it's good to be deployed. The way I would think of it, though is that if rates were to go up or we started to lose some of the search deposits, our cash flows from this investment portfolio we're building could be easily $10 billion a quarter. So, we could just not reinvest. If we have strong loan growth, we could use that cash flow to deploy into loan growth. So, it gives us a lot more flexibility, a lot more optionality. And it also helps protect our margin and help run rate. You pay us to run our company and do what we think is best. We think this is a good balanced approach to managing the company. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And as a follow-up, Kelly, I share your view about vaccines in this COVID and the therapeutics that we'll have next year. And hopefully, the economy really starts to open up. But I want to come back to something you said about the small business owners and if the economy doesn't come back, there could be some more meaningful fallout. Can you kind of frame for us, and I know it's subjective, but can you frame for us when does -- if the economy doesn't come back by the second quarter or the first quarter, when do you really start to get concerned about that fallout? Kelly King : Well, Gerard, that's something else, we don't know. But I think today that some of course have already gone away. I mean, they couldn't -- for whatever reason, they couldn't qualify by the stimulus. They chose not to. They just threw in the towel. But that's a small percentage. Most have been buoyed by the stimulus support, PPP and other loan assistance programs. As that begins to phase out, these businesses will have tougher decisions to make. But, I'll tell you that a lot of these small businesses are pretty creative. I mean, they're pretty resilient. And so, I wouldn't expect to see a majority of small businesses fold or anywhere close to that. I think, most are going to find ways to reinvent their business. It's incredible how smart all business people are. That -- basically, my whole career, and they're pretty tough group. So, I wouldn't write them off. I'm just saying that it has gone into the second quarter and [indiscernible] someone back out buying again, and we will see a shakeout. Here's the thing today, consumer purchases are back up. The credit card activity, I mean, it's up year-over-year. So, it went through a trough. It's back up year-over-year. So, they're buying, but buying in different ways. So, what these small businesses have to do is figure out whether it's carryout or dine out in the backyard or whatever it is if you're a restaurant. The creative ones will figure it out. Some won't be able to figure it out, and they'll have to find another career. But, I think that all will begin to be clear, Gerard, as we head into the second quarter. Operator : We will now take our next question from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Hi. Just on credit, so a couple -- two-part question there. First, on the delinquencies, it looks like both, 90-plus and 30 to 89 increase. I just want to get some color what you're seeing beginning to migrate? If there's any concentration there, what's driving that? And then, separately, on the loan loss reserves, if we do see the delinquencies start to interpret into a steady rise in charge-offs, is it fair to assume as charge-offs rise that you're adequately reserved? And accordingly, you could see the reserve to loan ratio decline as that happens? Clarke Starnes : John, this is -- yes, this is Clarke. I'll answer that, John. On the delinquency side, we typically see, in consumer anyway, some elevated early stage as you go through the second half of the year. So, third quarter is going up a little bit, part of that seasonal. You'll see a lot of it's concentrated in the government-guaranteed portfolios around student and mortgage. So, if you take that out, particularly for your 90-plus, that was the majority there. It was flat otherwise. So, again, nothing alarming at this point. We anticipate part of that each year. And to your second question, all of that is considered as we go through our modeling and our allowance and our view of the scenarios that we selected. So, yes, I think we've assumed there will be further deterioration as we move forward. This is very likely. And that's all been included in our estimate to date. John Pancari : Okay. Good. That's helpful. And then, secondly, on the net interest margin front. I know that you indicated that -- Daryl, that the reported margin should see some slight pressure through the remainder of the year. I just wanted to get your thoughts on the core margin outlook, just given some of the actions you've taken, and how you're thinking about that from here? Daryl Bible : Yes. So, I would tell you, we had a good drop in deposit cost this past quarter. We still think we have room to go there. So, our interest-bearing costs are 15%. My guess is over the next quarter or two, will be single digit. I think, that's just the direction that we're headed right now. I think that's a possibility. I think that will help. I think, as we can grow some of our consumer portfolio successfully, that will help mitigate some of our core margin. You have higher yields in those portfolios, and that would definitely help as we were able to be successful in growing that. And the other thing I would just tell you is that we are doing everything we can to protect our core margin and try to grow as much as we can to offset the runoff. The runoff of purchase accounting is a little bit -- it's hard to predict. It depends on how the loans pay down on that. My guess right now is that it be down 3% to 5% right now, but you really don't know what's going to come through from that. You just have to do the best that you can with what's running off from that. But with PPP coming out over the next couple of quarters, that will help keep core margin probably in the 270s, and that will help mitigate the reduction of GAAP to what, depending how much you get PPP pay downs. Our guess is the bulk of our pay-downs will come in the first quarter or maybe second quarter. We'll get some this quarter. Recall, our company has about $12.5 billion of PPP loans on the books. We are planning to have invitations sent to all of our clients in the month of November, so they will all get invitations. How quickly they can respond with the documentation and we submit it to SBA is just a huge process. That's why we're thinking it's more centered in the first half of '21 than in this quarter, but you don't really know. It's an unknown right now. Kelly King : Well, a couple of other things. Keep in mind that our people have been very successful in terms of floors with regard to new loans and existing renewals. The other thing is that if the economy comes back faster, which I think it may, there's going to be a substantial pent-up demand for expansions. And so, we will see an increase in loan demand for, I call it, normally priced loans, which will be a plus to grow the NIM. So a couple of things there could really help us on NIM in addition to what Daryl said. John Pancari : Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. I know you said relatively flat on the core NIM in your guidance. I was just looking for the drivers behind it and then maybe the behavior beyond that. Thank you. I appreciate it. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Okay. A couple of questions. One is on how you think about the reserve release. I know it's early to ask this question, but we all model out a couple of years. So, I'm just trying to understand what your thought process is with regard to when you would start to release reserves? Is it to match any net charge-offs that you get from here, or maybe there's something else you're thinking about you could let us in on? Thanks. Daryl Bible : Clarke, do you want to take that or... Clarke Starnes : Yes. Maybe I'll start and then Daryl or Kelly can kick in. I mean certainly, Betsy, we think it's premature to be talking about releases right now, given the environment. So, I think you'll see in our estimate this quarter we've been, I think, prudent around considering there's still a lot of economic uncertainty around whether there'll be any more stimulus, what the ultimate outcome of these accommodations are and just pace of the recovery. So, I think for us, we would want to be sure we have much better clarity there and see the economy on very firm ground and client performance be at a really strong level before I think you see us consider releases. Betsy Graseck : And, I guess the question -- yes, go ahead. Kelly King : One of the things, kind of interesting -- so to your point, if everything were precise, as I understand it, the economy performs as we expected in terms of our CECL projections, rates are as we projected, so our net present value is the same as projected, if all of that would happen, it would be a hands down correlation between reserve reductions productions and [indiscernible] But as Clarke said, it's not going to be 100% correlation. And the other thing is, and I hope this is not true, but do we get any pressure from the regulators to hold theirs up even though all the math and all the concepts say should be coming down? We've not heard think about that, but that's how the way it goes. Betsy Graseck : Yes. So, how does it work with CECL, as my follow-up question? I know maybe that's a little bit longer than the time you want to spend on it -- on this topic. But the question really is around how to think about the trajectory of the reserves from here? Like in the old incurred loss model, there was some general reserve that you could have. And I'm just wondering, as we go through this recession and we have maybe some asset classes are experiencing greater than expected loss, others less than expected loss, can you shift the reserves around? And the question really ends up being, how fungible are the reserves that you put up against these specific asset classes that you've identified? Thanks. Daryl Bible : Clarke, I'll start, if you want to, maybe add to it. But, I mean we do it both ways, Betsy, and that we do a bottom-up analysis. So, our modelers go through, when we model, all of the portfolios, and we've brought it against the scenario, and we come up with a bottom-up analysis. Given the limitations of the models and the uncertainty in the environment, there's always top-down adjustments that occur that are basically in play there. So, it's really -- it's a process you go through. And you have to know what you have in the models today. If the economy gets better and everything else stays the same, you could see a release potentially. But, that's not reality. Things are always changing. Things are always getting regarded, up and down in the portfolio. Client behaviors are changing, more charge-offs or whatever. So, it's always a dynamic process. I think, Clarke and his team do a great job in analyzing it. We thoroughly review it several times before we come with our numbers each quarter. So, it's just -- it's hard to predict right now especially with the uncertainty how high the economic variables are today and the model limitations out there, there's a lot of qualitative adjustments occurring right now. Mark? Clarke Starnes : No, no, I think, you said it well, Daryl. I think, it's very granular by segment, and that segment analysis in our view of the economy and the impact on all of that does allow us to adjust the estimate as needed. And so, you could have differences quarter-to-quarter by those different segments. And that could impact the level of the estimate. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Hi. My question goes to slide 12 where the efficiency trends have not gone the right direction the last couple of quarters, but you just gave guidance for that to improve in the fourth quarter. You talked about personnel savings, CRE, branch, third-party systems and closing 104 branches. So, I think I'm summarizing what I heard. So, my question is, why not more, why not faster? This is one of the biggest merger overlaps that you've seen. You're allowed to close branches starting in December. Yesterday, U.S. Bancorp said they're going to close 300 branches, and you just said you're going to close about 100 branches. It just seems like you could do a lot more. And are you being too safe to get the merger integration smooth? I mean, you are growing deposits, no blow ups, and I'm sure you're protecting the long-term franchise. But, I thought that efficiency story would be coming in a little sooner than it's come in. Thanks. Daryl Bible : So Mike, I'll start with that, and others can help me finish the answer. So, I'll start with -- we have five buckets of cost savings. You started with the branch system. So, we are closing 104 branches, as I said in my prepared remarks, in the December-January time frame. I also said that we're looking at opportunities to pull forward some other branch closures in 2021. We aren't at the stage yet to announce exactly what we're going to do there. But, we did give you an indication that there is a possibility, and we wouldn't have said that if it wasn't a strong reality that we're going to pull forward a significant piece of some branch closures in 2021. We'll give you that once we are able to do that. If you look at our third-party spend, the third-party providers, to date, right now, with -- dealing with vendors, our sourcing and procurement teams have basically realized $266 million of savings from that. We think that run rate translates into about $300 million in 2021. They are not at their goals yet. They're still trying to get more savings. We think that will occur over the next year or so. We hope those numbers will exceed $400 million before it's all said and done from a run rate perspective. As contracts come up, as we redeploy, we're still going through the process of negotiating contracts with an end provider of these services that we are having right now. So everything can be fully negotiated yet. Next one would be in our non-branch facilities. We talked about that in our last earnings call. We have 29 million square feet outstanding, if you add branches and non-branches out there. We talked about potentially taking 5 million square feet out in our non-branch areas this next year. We said the average cost of that on a gross basis was $30 a square foot. There will be a little bit of investment come back as we refit under the socially distanced areas and all that for the buildings that are surviving. We have branches that will probably have another 2 million to 3 million square feet there. So, we'll be close to 20 million square feet probably by the end of 2021 in our company from that perspective. So, that's a third that we're taking out very aggressively, very quickly. The fourth area is in technology. I talked about it in the prepared remarks. We're just now getting in the midst of getting through conversions. We've done some small conversions, not client facing, and we started to decommission systems, started to get systems there. We just did a conversion in those area in capital markets, large corporate area and all that stuff. So, those savings are going to be captured. As we get through conversions in the first quarter in Joe's area with wealth and broker dealer that we have there in that, one is in the first quarter, the other one is second quarter. It takes probably three to six months before we get through and get those systems decommissioned. Scott has plans to -- we don't need 4 data centers right now. We're going to end up with a couple of data centers at the end of the day. That will probably be a '22 savings. So, we will get those savings. It's just a matter of when we are able to get those closed and get everything transferred. And the last one on personnel. If you look at our FTEs, every quarter, they have been falling in FTEs that we pulled forward FTEs. As we go through these conversions, we're going to have continued FTE closures. I mean, we don't need as much of areas on the support side as we go through these conversions and get things finalized. So, there's a lot to come. We are not backing down from the $1.6 billion. We aren't backing down from the timing, where we're going to come through on target like we said we were, and this is just a way of doing it. Kelly King : And Mike, just to amplify, your question is a good one. It's appropriate about the branches. But two points. Up to this point, we have been cautious in terms of closing branches because we want to have -- we wanted to have maximum availability for our clients. Keep in mind that we've had to basically close down the lobbies. And now, we're fortunate about 98-plus percent of our branches have drive-thrus. So, our drive-thrus have been open throughout. For the last several months, we've had in-branch activity based on phones [ph] only. We just opened up this week like 1,500 branches full-service and the lobbies. So, once we get the branches back to kind of normal and our client service capability is back to normal, then, we will be more aggressive in terms of the closings. Because we have a large number of branches that are literally side to side, actually, in many cases, sharing the many parking lot, and our people, as Daryl alluded, are literally in the process of developing an aggressive plan with regard to that. So, don't hear us say we're not going to be best in with regard with branch closures. But, we're not just going to announce it today because they're literally in the process of putting final touches on what it's going to look like. Mike Mayo : And then, one follow-up. Just to put a bow around it, how much in merger cost savings do you have so far in the third quarter run rate, and what do you expect for 2021 and 2022 again? Daryl Bible : So, for the third quarter, we're probably around 35%, give or take. We're still targeting 40% in the fourth quarter. The guidance that we gave is in the middle of that range that I gave you there, so plus or minus on that side of that. For the end of fourth quarter of '21, we're still at 65% of the $1.6 billion, and then the whole $1.6 billion by the end of 2022. So, we are not changing the timing of that. Operator : We will now take our next question from Saul Martinez from UBS. Saul Martinez : Good morning. Following up a little bit on NII, Daryl, Ken. Daryl, what is embedded in your fourth quarter core NIM -- reported NIM guidance for PPP forgiveness, if anything? And can you just remind us or give us an update as to what you are thinking right now for forgiveness rates over, I guess, the next three quarters? And, any color on what the sort of the fee rate is on that forgiveness because, obviously, it does move the needle a bit on NII with that accelerated forgiveness. Daryl Bible : Yes. So, what I would say, when we talked about this last quarter, our estimate hasn't really changed and that we still think 75% of it will pay off with this forgiveness piece. That's a guesstimate. We really don't know. We are, like I said earlier, sending invitations out to everybody from that. For this fourth quarter, of that 75%, we're probably around 20%, but a shot in the dark of what actually might get paid off. We really don't know the timing. If you look at the news that came out last week from the SBA and the two-pager for the $50,000 and less, the numbers on that is out of our 80,000 clients, we have 45,000 clients that are $50,000 or less, but it only represents 7% of the dollars. So, it's a huge volume piece. So hopefully, a lot of that -- most of that will probably get processed very quickly. But, we've actually gone through and done some forgiveness on a limited basis, just to learn the process. And we've actually gotten paid from the SBA on a couple. So, we're learning and gearing up, and we're getting ready to do it holistically out to everybody at once, once we got the processes all lined up. So, we're gearing up for that. We think the first quarter, Saul, will be our biggest quarter. Right now, the estimate is around 60% and the rest would be in second quarter. But you really don't know. I mean, it's timing of it is -- it's a pure shot in the dark, but that's what's in our numbers right now. Saul Martinez : Right. And I know it's more tilted towards the first quarter. But, does your fourth quarter guidance explicitly incorporate that 20% forgiveness in certain fee rate on top of that? I know I'm getting a little bit nitpicky here, but if we kind of strip that out -- yes. Okay. Daryl Bible : There's risk. I mean, if it's less than 20, we may miss 4; if it's more than 20, we may exceed 4. But that will be the only end [indiscernible] other variables. But that is an assumption that plays out, absolutely, there. Maybe the other thing you have to think about, Saul -- sorry, when can you realize it just. Because somebody sends it in, do you realize it, when they send it in or when actually they get the dollars wired back into us? So, we're working with our external auditors and the timing of when we recognize that payoffs. Saul Martinez : Right. Without PPP forgiveness, can you maintain core NIM swap or is it pretty much impossible to do that, given the environment? Daryl Bible : My guess is that the core margin without PPP is probably in the high 260s right now. That would be my guess, maybe still 270. I mean, it all depends on what Kelly said, the loan growth, the ability to grow the higher yielding portfolios and really get a mix change. If we could just mix, invest some of the excess liquidity that we have in loans versus securities or Fed balances, that's a really positive way to help your core margin. It's just a matter of trying to get the loan volume to support that. Saul Martinez : Just one final quickie, just absolutely, just want to make sure. The guidance for expenses and revenue, that is based on the adjusted noninterest expense number of 3,147 and incorporates the adjusted noninterest income, I guess, of 2,106. Just want to clarify that. Daryl Bible : Yes. In my prepared remarks, I adjusted both, the expense side and the revenue side. Saul Martinez : Okay. I just wanted to make sure. Thank you. Ryan Richards : That concludes our Q&A session. Thank you, Vijay. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I apologize for those with questions we didn't have time to get to. We're happy to reach out to you later today to address those questions. We wish you all the best. Goodbye. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your call.",

As a reminder, this event is being recorded and it is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Ryan Richards, Director of Investor Relations for Truist Financial Corporation. Ryan Richards : Thank you, Abby, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today where our Chairman and CEO, Kelly King; President and COO, Bill Rogers and CFO, Daryl Bible will highlight a number of strategic priorities and discuss Truist fourth quarter 2020 results. Chris Henson, Head of Banking and Insurance and Clarke Starnes, our Chief Risk Officer, will also participate in the Q&A portion of our call. We are conducting our call today from different locations to help protect our executives and teammates. The accompanying presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the Truist Investor Relations website. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on slides two and three of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix for appropriate reconciliations to GAAP With that, I will turn it over to Kelly. Kelly King : Thank you, Ryan, and good morning, everybody. Thank you very much for joining our call. We really appreciate that. You know, I would say overall, this quarter and this year are very good given the challenging environment that we faced. We had a continued focus on our strong culture, it's activating very, very well. We're executing well on our revenue synergies. We had really effective expense focus and we made appropriate investments for the future, and importantly, supported our team mates in difficult environment, and kept our clients and communities number one. Our purpose is to inspire and build better lives and communities. And we think in the times we live in today, this is more important than ever. We focus on our mission, we focus on our values. I would point out to you that with regard to our values, ultimately we focus most of our attention on the happiness of our teammates. In the challenging environment that we face today, helping people get through the challenges they're living with at home and at work and all of the various difficulties that people are going through, finding happiness in this environment is a very, very important undertaking and we work hard to try to help that be possible for our teammates. If you're following along on the slides, let's go to Slide 5. I just wanted to point out that, you know it's nice to say -- pardon me, that you have a culture, it's nice to say you have an important purpose, but is more important to live it. So I just want to point out a few of the things that we have done that I'm proud of in terms of living our purpose. You know that during the course of the year, we launched our Seeds of Hope program where we helped our teammates  with money to grow, [Indecipherable] do little projects, little things to help people in need. We launched our Truist One Team theme -- fund, our Home Page program. Our Truist Cares program was very effective where we invested over $50 million to meet the immediate long-term needs of our communities, our clients and our teammates. We provided over $100 million in special COVID support for our teammates, and 750,000 client accommodations; $13 billion in PPP loans, which funded -- helped for more than 80,000 companies and created also -- or protected about 3 million jobs. And we did 355 small to medium sized grants in our communities. I'm very proud of our $60 billion three-year community benefits program. I would say to you we are ahead of the time schedule in terms of making those investments. We supported those who are historically underrepresented through a $780 million commitment, that in turn include $40 million in helping establish an organisation called CornerSquare Community Capital, which is focused specifically on CDFIs in the minority space. And we're proud that we were able to invest $20 million over three years to support HBCUs and their students. On Slide 6, let's talk a little bit about where we are with the merger. I want to make a point of context for you with regard to how we think about our merger, because this is a bit different than most mergers. It's very different than the many, many mergers, I've been through in my career. We're not just putting two big companies together here cutting expenses and trying to improve profitability in the short term, rather we are building, what I call a new bank. We are building a bank based on the best of both -- from both organizations. Then in some cases just new systems and processes. For example in our commercial lending area, we've taken the very new and very best-in-class SunTrust in senior loan origination program and the BB&T back end system in terms of commercial loans. So combined, we have the best from both sides, and it's a classic case where two plus two equals five. We certainly could have picked one, it would have been cheaper, it would have been faster, but it would not have been better and it would not have been client-focused. Daryl is going to be talking to you about merger charges, another merger expenses a little later. I just want to emphasize that as he does that, remember that you have the normal merch that we called out early on in the announcement, that's normal signage and different systems that are just going away, they're being dry, they have no future benefit. They really are just a merger charge. And then we have these other investments which I call investments, because they are. They are investments in the future. They're making our organization better, it's client-focused, and while they will not be in our on-going long term run rate, these are with money to do little projects, little things that help people in need. We launched our Truist One team theme, found our home page program. Truist Cares program was very effective where we invested over $50 million to make immediate longer term need of our communities, our clients and our team mates. We provided about $100 million in special COVID for our team mates and 750,000 client accommodation for 13 billion in PPP loans. We funded help for more than 80,000 companies and created also are protective about three million jobs and we do 355 small medium type grants in our communities. I am very proud of our 60 billion three year community benefits program. I'd say to you we are ahead of the time schedule in terms of making those investments. We supported our representatives on our $780 million commitment and then it included 40 million in helping our from organization help [indiscernible] for our community, our capital reaches focus specifically on CFRs in the minority space and we're proud that we were able to invest $20 million over three years to support HBCUs and their peers. On Slide six, let's talk a little bit about where we are with the merger. I want to make a point of context for you with regard to how we think about our merger because it's a bit different than most of our deals, very different than the many, many mergers I've been through in my career. We're not just pretty tune big companies here together cutting expenses and trying to improve profitability in the short term. Rather we're building what I call a new bank. We're building a bank based on the best of both -- four both organizations and it's just new systems and processes. Like for example, in our commercial lending area, we've taken a very new and very best in class SunTrust and single loan origination program and BB&T back in system in terms of commercial loans. So combined, we have the advantage from both sides and it's basically the case where two plus two equals five. We saw the [indiscernible] one would have been cheaper and would have been faster but it would not have been better and would not have been client focused. Daryl is going to be talking to you about our merger charges, North American expenses a little later but this will emphasize that, remember that you have normal that we called out early on in the announcement that's normal sign in different systems that are just going away that have been drive future benefit, they really are just a merger short. And then we have investments which I call investments and investments in the future that make our organization better, it's client focused and while they will not be in our own going long-term run rate, these are investments that we make today to be sure that we have our agile very client focused organization as we go forward. While you'll see there are a number of accomplishments for 2020, I'll just point out a couple of those. Very importantly, we've made great progress in our culture, could not feel better about that. We established our brand and visual identity. We successfully merged first digital conversion we believe in terms of modern days in Truist Securities, activated our integrated relationship management process which was pivotal to our success. We did consolidate a 104 branches, leveraging our blended branch program which is innovative. Remember we did divest $2.3 billion loans and deposits, about 30 branches and there have been a lot of corporate backroom functions that have been integrated including audit, risk, legal, finance and others. And we importantly did a huge amount of work on appropriate job re-grading for our teammates. Daryl will comment with regard to some cost with regard to that, but this was a very important process in terms of making sure that our teammates through the year knew that we were going to do the right thing in terms of looking at the new responsibilities, establishing the right kind of job, and appropriate compensation. And we chose to make that retroactive for them during 2020, because it was the right thing to do. They would do the job, we just had -- not have a chance yet to properly raise a compensation and it has served us very, very well. In terms of '21, just a few points here. Everybody tends to focus on the core branch conversion, which as you know is in the first half of '22. That is very, very important, make no mistake. But look, there are huge amount of conversions and other activities going on in '20; '20 is a really big conversion year. We will complete our Wealth Brokerage conversion, we'll have our mortgage conversion, our sales force conversion, we'll be closing an additional 226 branches in the first quarter, we'll be implementing our digital first migration, supporting our T3 concept, in terms of meeting our clients' needs on a seamless basis, integrating technology in Truist to yield a high level of trust. And so, there are a lot of activities that are going on during the course of the year. But yes, definitely want you to be thinking, there's not much could be happening at Truist with regard to conversion for the first half of '22, because frankly most of the hard work will be done by the end of this year and then we'll actually execute on the final branch closures and conversions as we head into '22. Second, a few highlights with regard to our performance on Slide 7. I'm very excited about our revenue, our total taxable equivalent revenue of $5.6 billion, up 5.5% annualized versus the fourth quarter. That was really driven by stable net interest income, strong fee income, especially in investment banking and trading income, strong insurance performance. Chris will talk about that, if we get questions in Q&A. I am very proud of five insurance acquisitions just in the fourth quarter alone, and we expect more activities as we head into '21. A very strong adjusted net income available to common shareholders of $1.6 billion. We had diluted earnings per share of $1.18, diluted return on average assets of 1.35% and a very strong adjusted return on average tangible common equity of 19.03%. So as you can see, we are well on the way to top performance and all the metrics that we projected when a deal was announced, which is kind of miraculous, you know, it has been two years, there's a lot been going on, but we are still tracking and doing really well in terms of hitting that top performance level of metrics as we expected that we -- that we would. Daryl is going to be commenting on some capital issues. I would point out to you that we -- our Board did approve over $2 billion in common stock repurchases, which will start in the first quarter. We have outstanding credit quality performance, much better than expected, and our common equity Tier 1 is exactly right on 10% which is what we had projected a couple of years ago. On Slide 8, I'll just point out to you the unusual items for this quarter, and you can see that we have the regular merger charges, and as I related to earlier the incremental operating expenses are not in the long term run rate and they equated to $0.28 drive with regard to a GAAP versus adjusted. So that's a quick look at the early highlights. I mean, I'll turn it to Bill for some focus on some key areas, Bill? Bill Rogers : Great. Thank you, Kelly and good morning everybody. As Kelly just noted, Truist is the first large bank merger in the digital age. And with that in mind, we determined it was really imperative that our clients began experiencing an enhanced digital platform this year. And this is demonstrated on page 9. While our foundation is two leading digital experiences, we're going to accelerate the delivery of features like personalized financial insights, AI-driven chat bots, other client-centric enhancements. We're going to pilot this in both platforms in the second quarter and then we'll begin migration in waves in the third quarter and complete full migration to premier Truist experience for our digital clients by year end, sort of emphasizing Kelly's point of how much has been done this year. As you can see on page 10, we are experiencing excellent digital adoption and usage from our clients. So for the 12 months through November, we experienced a 26% increase in digital sales, 12% growth in active mobile users, 22% increase in mobile check deposits and a 5% increase in statement suppression. I think all would speak to increased digital adoption. This is an area where we're already seeing the benefits from our investment and on the right side, we show some recent enhancements. So for instance, the SunTrust business online and mobile experience incorporates significant updates and it was built in-house to give us more control of the app's functionality and performance long-term. The heritage award winning BB&T U platform now provides insights to help clients better manage new spending and behaviors including an end of month cash flow analysis and enhanced notifications, just to name a few, and very consistent with our whole Q3 premise. You know, this is a prime example of what Kelly talked about with best of both. Using BB&T U client driven front end at a more flexible agile heritage SunTrust driven back end, this clearly positions us I think really well for the future. We believe initiatives such as these underscore our commitment to improve the lives of our clients and demonstrate our investment effectiveness. So let's turn to page 11. We experienced further decline in balances across most loan categories in the face of continued economic uncertainty and elevated liquidity. Average total loans decreased $7.6 billion, largely attributable to commercial loan balances and ongoing run off in the residential mortgage portfolio. And commercial average balances declined $5.4 billion, primarily due to line paydowns and lower utilization. Paydowns activity reflected larger client's ability to obtain financing from capital markets and SunTrust securities is well positioned to assist them which you'll see later. Commercial balances were also impacted by $1.4 billion reduction in PPP loans and the transfer of $1 billion in assets to held for sale following our decision to exit a small ticket loan and lease portfolio. We experienced a rebound within our dealer floor plan clients after bottoming in July due to OEM supply chain disruptions, dealer floor plan balances have steadily improved as new core inventories were replenished. We also saw growth in mortgage warehouse lending and government finance. Commercial activity remains bifurcated as a whole with a greater share coming from large and medium sized companies than from small businesses. And consumer average balances decreased $2.2 billion, this was largely due to seasonality and refinance activity that resulted in lower residential mortgage, residential home equity and direct loan balances. Average balances in our indirect auto portfolio increased $1.1 billion. Loan production was really strong as vehicle sales rebounded especially for us in the prime segment. Overall, we've remained cautiously optimistic. We're hopeful that the successful rollout of COVID-19 vaccines together with additional government stimulus will increase visibility, revive confidence and support the economic recovery, all of which will be essential for loan growth. We are extremely well positioned in businesses and markets that we will believe will most benefit from this. So let's continue on page 12 to look at deposits. Deposit trends remain favorable during the quarter. Growth was robust and broad-based supported by a combination of seasonal inflows and ongoing growth resulting from pandemic related client behavior. Average non-interest bearing and interest checking balances were each up over $3 billion, while money market and savings were $1.1 billion. Average time deposits decreased $4.3 billion primarily due to the maturity of wholesale negotiable CDs, and higher costs personal and business accounts. Importantly, we're able to achieve a strong level of deposit growth while maximizing the value proposition to clients outside of repaying. For instance, the average total deposit costs decreased three basis points to seven basis points and average interest bearing deposit costs declined four basis points to 11 basis points. So with that, let me turn it over to Daryl to discuss our financial performance for the quarter. Daryl Bible : Thank you, Bill and good morning everybody. Turning to Slide 13, in the fourth quarter, reported net interest margin decreased two basis points to 3.08% reflecting lower purchase accounting accretion. Core net interest margin was unchanged at 2.72%. Core margin benefited from higher yields on PPP payoffs, recognition of deferred interest on loans and lower funding costs offset by excess liquidity. Earning assets rose $3 billion primarily due to an increase in deposits, resulting in a modest improvement in net interest income, we partially hedged our exposure to rising rates by pay-fixed swaps to offset market risk associated with our investment security. The chart on the bottom left shows the increase in our asset sensitivity due to quarter positive growth, additional pay fix loss and the residential mortgage run off, which was partially offset by the growth in the investment portfolio. Turning to Slide 14, our integrated relationship management strategy is helping to improve fee income. The noninterest income increased $179 million through third quarter security gains of $104 million. We had record investment banking and trading income of $308 million due to strong activity in M&A and loan syndications, lower counterparty refers and improved trading profits. We also generated record commercial real estate income of $123 million driven by structured real estate transactions and strong production and sales activity at Grandbridge. Insurance grew 7% versus fourth quarter of '19 due to strong production and premium growth as well as acquisitions. Organic growth was 2.9%. If you exclude the Truist policy last year, organic growth was 4.9%. We completed five insurance acquisitions during the fourth quarter, which we expect will add more than $110 million in annual revenue and approximately $7 million in adjusted expense. Turning to Slide 15, noninterest expense increased $78 million reflecting a $99 million increase in merger cost. Adjusted noninterest expense rose $27 million due to higher professional fees for strategic technology projects and higher personnel expense. Personnel expense increased $50 million reflecting higher incentives related to strong revenue production and the impact of our job re-grading process which concluded late last year. Job regrading regarding in the fourth quarter catch up in personnel expense. Approximately $50 million of this was related to prior quarters. Through the effort, we were able to honor our commitment to establish jobs and rewards program and harmonizing all teammates in the combined framework. FTEs decreased 1300 during the quarter and were down 8% since the merger was announced. We closed 104 branches during the quarter, bringing the full year total to 149, net occupancy decreased $26 million benefitting from aggressive closures of non-branch facilities. Turning to Slide 16, as we said we are seeking the opportunity to build best of both franchise. This approach is harder than a typical acquisition, but we believe the benefit to our clients justify the effort. Since the merger was announced, we have incurred $1.2 billion of merger-related and restructuring expenses. These expenses have no future benefit and are not part of the post conversion run rate. We also incurred $725 million of incremental operating expenses related to the merger. These expenses do provide future benefit and are integral to building a best of both franchise. The incremental operating expenses are not part of future run rate and will end after the conversions in 2022. Based on our integration plan, we expect the merger related and restructuring charges of approximately $2.1 billion and total incremental operating expenses of approximately $1.8 billion. This resulted in a combined total charges of approximately $4 billion. Turning to Slide 17, strong credit performance was characterized by minimal increase in NPAs and an excellent loss experience resulting in lower provision expense. We saw favorable trends in problem loan formation as the criticized and classified loans decreased 8.4%. The provision of $177 million benefited from lower charge-offs and a modest reduction in reserves. Due to the decision to exit the small ticket loan and lease portfolio, the allowed coverage ratio remained strong at 7.15 times net charge-offs and 4.39 times nonperforming loans. Active accommodations were down significantly since the second quarter. Approximately, 97% of the commercial clients and 91% of the consumer clients who exited the accommodation program are current on their loans. Our exposure to COVID sensitive industry decreased 2.6% to $27.1 billion, or approximately 9% of outstanding loans. We also had the third lowest loss rate among peers in the latest CCAR test. We believe this outcome reflects prudent client selection and underwriting as well as diversification from the merger. Turning to slide 18, the allowance for credit losses decreased $30 million largely due to moving the $1 billion portfolio into held for sale. Our macro assumptions include, unemployment remaining fairly stable through mid-2021 and improving thereafter and GDP recovery in pre-COVID levels by late 2021. We also layer in qualitative adjustments for COVID related uncertainty. Continued improvement in the economic activity, less uncertainty, and stabilization of a criticized asset may process to release reserves in the coming quarters. Turning to slide 19. Our capital ratios were relatively stable with the CET1 ratio unchanged at 10%. We declared a common dividend of $0.45 per share and a dividend and total payout ratios of 49.4%. In December, the board authorized the repurchase of up to $2 billion of the company's common stock starting in the first quarter. Our intention is to maintain an approximate 10% CET1 ratio after taking into account strategic actions, stock repurchases and changes in risk-weighted assets. For the first quarter, we expect to repurchase approximately $500 million. The board authorized other measures to optimize our capital position, including the redemption of the outstanding Series F and G preferred stock, and liquidity remained strong and we are prepared to meet the funding needs of our clients. Turning to Slide 20, this slide highlights our progress towards achieving the $1.6 billion in net cost saves. Our efforts to reduce third-party spend are ahead of expectations. We're now targeting 10% reduction in sourceable spend of $4.5 billion. In retail banking, we closed 149 branches in 2020. On a cumulative basis, we expect to close 800 branches by the 1st of 2022 including more than 400 branches by the end of 2021. We also expect to reduce our nonbranch footprint by approximately $4.8 million square feet through the combination of closures and downsizings. Through December 31, we reduced our nonbranch footprint by approximately 2.4 million square feet. So, we're roughly halfway through our goal. The remaining facilities will be rationalized during 2021. Cost saved from technology are highly dependent on core bank conversions because we can\u2019t decommission systems or data centers until the conversions are completed. The bottom of the slide less where we are making significant investments, we believe these investments are critical to delivering on our purpose and providing our catch-plus technology equals Truist approach to clients. Turning to Slide 21, the waterfall on the left shows how we did relative to our 2020 cost savings target. Our objective for 2020 was to achieve annualized fourth quarter net cost saves of $640 million, or 40% of the $1.6 billion target. This equates to the fourth quarter adjusted noninterest expense of $3.40 billion or less. We adjusted noninterest expense of $3.174 billion and exceeded our target including catch up and expenses related to job ratings, commissions on higher revenue and the non-qualified expenses which are substantially offsetting other income. If you exclude these items, adjusted noninterest expense would come in slightly below target. As you can see from this slide, we're maintaining our medium-term targets and reaffirming our cost saving targets for 2021 and 2022. For 2021, our targeted fourth quarter adjusted expense would be $2.940 billion excluding acquisitions. Now I will provide guidance for the first quarter expressed in changes from the prior quarter. While the environment remains fluid, we continue to see momentum in our businesses, which may enable us to outperform the guidance. The first quarter had fewer number of days and seasonally higher personnel cost. We expect taxable equivalent revenue to be down 3% to 5% as a result of fewer days and purchase accounting loss. We expect our reported net interest margin to be down two to four basis points based on less purchase accounting accretion and a change in the core margin. We expect core margin to be relatively stable with the exception of increased liquidity coming from the balance sheet, that could pressure the margin up to five basis points. Non-interest expense adjusted for merger cost and amortization is expected to be down 2% to 4%. We also anticipate net charge-offs in the range of 30 to 45 basis points. Overall, we had a strong quarter with exceptional revenue growth, good margin performance and expense management and strong asset quality. Now let me turn it back to Kelly for closing remarks and Q&A. Kelly, you're on mute. Kelly King : Just to close, we have very few comments with regard to the Truist value proposition, which is to optimize our long-term total shareholder return really through a focus on strong capital, strong liquidity and diversification and intense client focus. We believe we have an exceptional franchise with diverse products, services and markets. We are the sixth largest commercial bank in the United States. We have strong market share is five fast-growing MSAs throughout the Southeast and the Mid Atlantic area. We are uniquely positioned to deliver best in class efficiency and returns while we continue to invest in the future. We're very committed as Daryl said to reaching our $1.6 billion of net cost savings. We have a really great mix of complementary businesses that allows us to expand our client base through our year old enhancement in revenue synergies. We have a very strong capital and liquidity position in sales, which positions us to be resilient as we go through very challenging times that we are experiencing. We are as I said earlier building a best-in-class new bank designed to be client purpose driven and resolutely committed to inspiring and building better lives and communities. We believe our best days are here for tourists in these States of America. I'll turn it back over to Ryan. Ryan Richards : Thank you, Kelly. Abby at this time, will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session? Operator : [Operator instructions] We'll take our first question from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Regarding the $1.8 billion in incremental operating expenses, could you just talk about that, like how that number has evolved versus your original expectation? I know it's the first time you're giving us that target. So how does that compare to where you originally expected and how has it evolved over time? And then can you give us a little bit more of your thought process behind it, in terms of, if we can continue to see upward pressure on that amount, or are you pretty confident in the $1.8 billion in that it's going to remain at that target? Thanks. Daryl Bible : Yeah, John, thanks for that question. I would tell you when we were putting the transaction together in late '18 and we announced in early '19, we thought $2 billion was the merger and restructuring charges, and we're pretty much on target with that. As we continued to work on all the integrations and we saw the opportunity to really build the best in breed of what we could do with our F systems and technologies, we just knew that we would basically be having, I would call it a lot of technology projects on steroids all at once, and that this would be a really unusual time to have all that costs running through our expense structure. So that's really what we came up with. And we've been tracking it to date, so far, and we feel pretty good about the forecast that we have. We're almost at $2 billion in total when you combine both charges of both the merger and restructuring and the incremental. So we have about $2 billion to go over the next year and a half. But we believe it was for the right reasons and makes all the sense that it's going to help our clients and really produce good performance for our Company going forward. Kelly King : So John, a way to think about that conceptually is that, that $1.8 billion is really as I think about it like our capital allocation for future benefits in terms of client focus and better systems and better processes. So it will flow through expenses. We will continue to report it too. Also you can think about it more in terms of an investment. John Pancari : Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. And then, separately on the -- on the branch and non-branch real estate reduction. I just want to confirm that those reductions that you're targeting and the savings that come from that, that is included in your targeted cost savings tied to the merger? Daryl Bible : Absolutely. Yes, [Speech Overlap]. So when we came up with the five buckets, you're talking about two of the buckets, I mean the retail branches we said originally would be between 700 and 800 branches, as you can see we're at the high end of that original estimate. That will be done by the first quarter of '22. And then on corporate real estate, even before COVID, when you put these two companies together, we have huge duplication all throughout the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast. So just going through and rationalizing that space, I will tell you COVID has helped us in a number of ways in that it's emptied out the buildings, so we can move quicker in the consolidation and my guess is, as we continue to make these combinations that we may actually exceed what we had originally estimated in real corporate real estate consolidations because of COVID and just the behaviors of people working at home. John Pancari : Yeah. Right, that was exactly what I was getting at, because I am assuming some of the corporate real estate reduction opportunity got bigger. You guys saw greater opportunity as COVID set in. So I was just wondering if that could present upside to your cost saving expectations if corporate real estate reduction can be more than you thought. Daryl Bible : Yeah, so we have a plan for where we are executing now in the $4.8 billion, once we complete that plan, I'm sure Kelly and Bill and Executive Leadership will reevaluate it and see if there is opportunity to do more in the future. Operator : And we will take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. All right, sorry about that. Yes, so I had a couple of questions. One, just on the integrated relationship management strategy, I'm wondering how that's progressing. The revenues are strong this quarter particularly in fees and so I just wanted to understand how much was the IRM helping to drive that result this quarter? Kelly King : Well, Betsy that's a huge part of it, and I'll let Bill give you some deep color with regard to that, but this is a concept of really integrating the way we focus on the client. You know, many institutions focus on a siloed way in terms of products and different services, we don't do that. We focus on the whole needs of the client, and so we've developed this as IRM process we call it, Integrated Relationship Management, over really several decades. And it's very, very effective, very efficient because everybody owns a client. Everybody is focused on meeting all the needs of the clients all the time. But we're seeing spectacular early positive feedback in terms of how it's working especially between the community bank and CIG. Bill, you may want to comment on that. Bill Rogers : Hey, Betsy. I mean, this is one of the really strong cultural alignments that Kelly and I talked about, when we first started talking about this merger, is this commitment to put the client first and create a culture and a structure that evolves from that. And we're seeing it. I mean, and the model is working. As Kelly noted, a couple of examples and the Investment Banking outperformance this quarter, in particular, I mean there was really just great contribution from our Commercial Community Bank and from our CRE and from our private wealth businesses. So that model of integrated relationship management is working. It's just been great adoption, great participation, really good cultural alignment. You see it in the insurance numbers, you see it in the Wealth numbers. So it's all part of this structure and focus. And we have -- we have lots of discipline around it. But the key is the cultural side. There are people committed to wanting to work together and work together towards a common goal to meet client needs and I'd say this quarter was probably one of the better examples of how the engine is really firing on all cylinders. Betsy Graseck : Okay, all right, thanks. And I appreciate that. The fee -- fees really jumped out on the screen. I guess the follow-up question on the expense line here is around, you know, some of the core expense inflation outside of the cost saves, you've got merit increases, bolt-on acquisitions, investments for revenue growth, etc. I'm just wondering how investors should think about where the total expense dollars will likely land post the net cost saves, what kind of guidance can you help us with there? Thanks. Kelly King : So Betsy, let me just mention in general, we have the itemized areas you've listed, but we are really focusing on expenses on a broader conceptual approach, we do in obvious. I mean, the obvious are, you know, as you got two of these, and you only need one and those kinds of things that's just going to happen. But we are heading into a period now where it's time for us to focus on optimization. It's time for us to focus on transformation or re-centralizing the business. Because so far what we basically have done is think about it as put two big banks together. Now, what we have -- and we get the -- we get less savings from that, just natural overlap. So, now we have the opportunity to re-conceptualize the business as we transform it post-COVID and all this going on with regard to the new digital world and there are enormous opportunities for us as we go through '21. So '21 is going to be an intense year of focus on expenses from the perspective of transforming our structures, so that we are doing the right things in terms of investments and expense allocations to meet the client's needs first, and we believe that will throw off positive benefits in terms of expenses. Daryl Bible : Betsy, what I would say in my prepared remarks, I gave for the fourth quarter of this year the $2.940 billion, now that excludes the merger and the restructuring charges, the incremental MOE expenses, amortization. And then I gave a call out on the expenses for the Insurance acquisitions of about $70 million adjusted expenses. So all of that will get carved out of that base. But when you look at like the job re-grading marketing considering that part of the investment, that's something that we\u2019re covering with our net saves. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. Let me talk about the timing of liquidity deployment this past quarter, obviously, securities went up a lot. It sounds like you had some of that. But what made you decide kinds now's the right time. We've seen the 10-year move up, but actually mortgage rates and I think rates on the types of securities that you would have bought were probably stable or down. And most people I think are expecting higher rates later this year. So what kind of drove you to deploy what seems like most of your excess liquidity this past quarter? Daryl Bible : So Matt, ideally, we would like to take this excess liquidity that we have and deploy it in loans, what we're seeing is that we just have a fair amount of payoffs in the PPP. But as businesses really come back and have a lot of momentum and start growing, as we get into the middle of latter half of \u201921, we really want to deploy that excess liquidity in lending. I would say that we decided to put some of that liquidity into the investment portfolio. We did that throughout the third quarter. We did partial heads up our hedges on them, basically to help with a mark-to-market on that. So when we added about $25 billion, $30 billion to the investment portfolio, we did have hedges on there about $20 million that we put on to help with the market risks that we have. So net-net, we feel good with what we've done. The real uncertainty on a go forward basis with all these new stimulus packages is, we could get potentially another $10 billion or $20 billion more liquidity into the balance sheet. I think we need to evaluate what we do with that excess liquidity whether we keep it at the Fed or invest it or ideally lend it out, which is the main primary objective. Matt O'Connor: Okay. That's helpful. And then circling back on the incremental cost related to deal, obviously you\u2019ve been incurring these already and I think the first time which is getting a lot of attention, but how we see these on the other side right, so like you did increase the net cost saves and right size having the synergies even though it really seems like it will become, how will we see the payback of that incremental $1.8 billion if you can break that how somehow? Kelly King : So these as I was describing are really investments, so think about this as we're building a whole new mortgage long delivery system. You will see the benefit of that in terms of -- in some cases just more efficient systems because they're newer, and the other is the effectiveness in terms of meeting client's needs. So we can -- for example in mortgage, you can do more mortgages because you're more efficient. You get more mortgage application because you have a better client experience. So it's just like, if your car has done a rundown and run out of 200,000 miles, you buy a new car, you make an investment, you see the benefit of that in terms of driving experiences, less breakdowns etc, etc. So it is an investment, that is the best way I can describe it to you to think about. Operator : We will take our next question from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika, your line is open, please check your mute button. Erika Najarian : Hi, thank you. My first question is on revenues. Kelly, you were very upbeat on the future of this Company and your peers were actually quite a bit on the future of economic growth. And I'm wondering as we think about going past the first quarter, how should we think about your base case for economic recovery relative to loan growth, which was -- well, your peers were surprisingly upbeat and also specific to you the insurance outlook? Kelly King : Yeah, Erika, we are upbeat as well. I would say, and I'll take a second why I'm upbeat regarding the economy. This economic downturn is dramatically different than what we've all experienced in the past. If you take the money correction, it was about our commercial real estate bubble, 2000 was a technology bubble, 2008 was the residential real estate bubble. There was no bubble here. There was nothing fundamentally wrong with the economy. In fact, we had ten years of robust growth, you know, have very, very low inflation, we just shut it off. That's important because we're not underlying impending issues that caused the economy to sputter. Now, if you kept it shut off for ten years, you have another issue, but given whether we ordered the vaccines, etc, we fully expect that you're most likely would see stronger snap back in the economy than most people expect. When we talked to our clients and prospects, they are really pretty upbeat. They are saying things like it's time to get on with it. We're ready to go, we're making investments and we're seeing that in terms of our robust pipeline of loan reversal activity. And so we are upbeat with regard to the economy. We think it will be slower in the first part, picking up steam as you head through the mid part, stimulus will have that summed, but mostly businesses and consumers feeling more confident. Look, when the vaccines are out there, I would say all, and as they become more widespread in terms of being injected, fear goes down, confidence goes up. People are ready to live again, people are ready to invest, are ready to run their businesses. So I fully expect by the time we head towards the fall and end of the year, you're going to be really surprised in terms of how robust this economy is. That will show up in terms of our commercial loan activity in a very big way. You're likely to see more residential loan growth than we would have expected in the slower economy and certainly you'll see in terms of our insurance activity as well. Let me just turn quick to Chris Henson and let him give you some color with regard to insurance that is very important. Chris Henson : Thanks Kelly and Erika thank you for the question. So maybe just to sort of fourth quarter and maybe just the outlook to your point, one of the best quarters that we have had in some time and with all the drivers of organic growth are really kind of hitting, hitting on all cylinders, client retention has stabilized in and retail at north of 90% for the last eight months wholesale, really strong at 85%, we're really seeing the cause of the factors in the market. Standard carriers are pushing risk to the wholesale market, and we're benefiting from that. Pricing another element organic growth as strong as we're in the hardest market we've seen in two decades, rates are up in the industry, north of 7%. And it's anticipated that we'll continue to see some hardening and acceleration into \u201821. Our new business, new business in 2019 was up in the 12% to 13%. That was as good as we've seen and we hit COVID. We were kind of negative 4% to 6%, didn't know where the year was going to shake out. But this quarter, our new business was up 19.5% up 8% year-to-date, some of the best numbers I have ever seen. So that all led to an organic growth number that we reported 2.9% to like quarter, 4.3% year-to-date. But just to key in on one point Daryl made, I think it's really important. The 2.9% growth number was really negatively impacted by one-time MOE related piece of insurance that was booked for our MOE deal in Q4 \u201819. So if you exclude that noise, organic growth really would have been on a core basis 4.9%. In terms of output, we expect first quarter commissions to be up in the 10% range, we're moving from our third best quarter of the year to our second best and first, obviously uncertainties in COVID that impact the economy. But the outlet is really strong given accelerator pricing, exposure units in the business are holding. We're growing excess and surplus lines because of the shift that I mentioned in the standard cares of support retail pushing it to E&S. And we're really benefiting from that diversification. And the pricing momentum, you think about the markets digest and the COVID impacts, CAT losses. We had 30 storms this year, the most in history in any given year. And three of the largest years in history of CAT losses occurred in the last four years. So it's got upward pressure and then lower interest rates, which puts pressure on investment income for underwriters. So pricing up 7%, you're seeing examples of things like in excess of 12.5%, D&O up 11.5%, property was we had a lot of up 9%, up in all classes all accounts. So, looking forward, what we're expecting is, in first quarter, is somewhere around the 5% kind of organic growth rate number. And we think that elevated catastrophe level, low interest rates , all that's really going to keep it propped up. And Kelly mentioned acquisitions, we were able to close five in the fourth quarter, and we expect more in 2021, so really bullish about insurance going forward. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you. That was very helpful. My second question is a two-parter on expenses. Daryl, if you can maybe briefly describe, what\u2019s in that $1.8 billion number, that would assure your investors and it just doesn't linger in the run rate? I think everybody gets scared when they see personnel as a descriptor. And going back to Slide 21 as a follow-up question to that and a follow-up question to Betsy's question. What do we do with that 3.037 number that annualizes to 12.16 as we think about your 2023 run rate? Is that a base for the run rates that includes the savings plus the growth rate just help us think about -- how to think about that number for 2023? Daryl Bible : So, I'll start on the latter question first. So it's pretty simple. We basically gave you the guidance for fourth quarter of \u201821, which was a $2.940 billion, in there that excludes the restructuring, MOE, amortization and acquisitions. That said, so that's the number we're targeting to get for fourth quarter of \u201821. That's pretty simple. And then that will continue on in \u201822 when we get all the cost saves into the net $1.6 billion. Your other question on \u201921, what was the question again the first part? Erika Najarian : Yes, if you can describe the types of expenses you're incurring in that $1.8 billion, yes, yes. Daryl Bible : Yes, it's the technology projects. And so the expenses that we can carve out, one-time cost like when we decommission something or something is put out of use, from that perspective has no future benefit. That's in the original merger and restructuring charges. But when you have developers going in and you have people going in with systems, and you have architects building out, you know our new [indiscernible]they're basically building a whole new Truist environment and technology. All those are real costs, we're doing all these technology costs all at once. All that has future benefit, we would typically not carve that out as merger and restructuring. It's basically just the combination of doing a lot of technology projects all at once. We just thought it was fair to call out because you would never really think of doing this all at once if it wasn't for the merger. But as Kelly said, at the end of the day, we're going to have a much better client experience, we're going to have much better performance overall. And you should see the benefits of all these systems integrated by doing the best between each of the systems that I think you're having a lot of revenue and other synergies going forward. Kelly King : Erika , keep in mind what Daryl emphasized, when you\u2019re doing this project you bring all those consultants in, but you also get them out. So with regard to consultants, we have a narrow front door and a very big back door. I'm going in the back door. Erika Najarian : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good morning. I had a question on back book repricing dynamics, and how to think about that from here, for Legacy BB&T and other banks more broadly, we saw downward pressure on loan yields persists throughout the last SERP cycle despite having a steeper curve. Can you discuss whether that downward pressure on yields is a dynamic, you'd expect to persist throughout the remainder of this SERP cycle as well? Daryl Bible : Bill, I would say in a normal balance sheet structure that would make a fair amount of sense, what we have going on our balance sheet, remember, we have some purchase accounting, we have PPP, and all that, we actually saw our yields, you can see that on our tables, you can see that we actually had loan yields higher for those various reasons. That said, I would tell you the steepening of the curve, we are asset sensitive, we\u2019re asset sensitive across the curve, little bit more short in the longer-end. But as the yield curve shifts, we will benefit from that, 25 basis point steepening of a curve will basically give us two to three basis points in core margin. So it is a phenomenon, if you look at how things are going on and off on a pure basis actually look at credit spreads going on, our commercial credit spreads are going on maybe three or four basis points higher than what they\u2019re coming off. And so I think all that is relatively good from that perspective. Kelly King : Yes, let me just add to Daryl\u2019s point, that's also a business mix and focus issue. So what would be traditionally a different back book look, on a forward basis as Daryl noted, I mean we\u2019re seeing improvement in margin that has to do with focus type of relationships, value that we're adding all those type things, and as he noted, you see that particularly in the commercial side. Bill Carcache : Understood. That's really helpful. And just as a quick follow-up on that same question, to the extent that PPP 1.0, and then 2.0 are going to be sort of contributing to the NIM in this SERP cycle, can you discuss how long you'd expect those tailwinds to persist through \u201921 and then not \u201922 or would they carry into \u201822 as well? Kelly King : You want to call that? Daryl Bible : Yes, Chris, you want to start this one? And I'll finish off? Chris Henson : Sure. Yes, we do obviously plan to participate in Round 2, probably in the neighborhood of $3 billion or so. We see most in Round 1 playing out through \u201921 and Round 2 probably coming in, the first half of the year and then rolling out the back half of the year. Really hard to call exactly when what quarter exactly that all is going to flow out. But to answer your question that I would say 90 plus percent of it should be gone by the end of \u201821. Daryl Bible : The thing I would just add to that Bill is that it has a huge impact obviously on core margin depending on when the forgiveness happens and it could be anywhere from three to five basis points depending on the amount that actually happens in any given quarter. One thing to note, round two is really focused on more smaller loans. So those actually drive higher fees, but our average fee on round one was about 2.7. Our estimate -- this is just an estimate because it's just now starting to roll out, you might see north of 5% fees on round two. We'll have less volume, but it will also have a huge impact on those as well. Kelly King : And just to give you a sense, we've invited 100% of round one through the path of forgiveness, but they submit information at different times. We've received and proposed on the SBA about 40% of that to this point. So some of the timing is really determined by the timing of the client provide the information. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : I was wondering Daryl, you could provide us a little more color on that commentary you gave about the first quarter revenue outlook, I believe you said down 3% to 5% FTE. Can you help us understand just what, Chris gave some color on insurance but kind of bifurcation between what you expect out of NII and fees and what the drivers would be especially in those other fee areas in addition to insurance, thanks? Daryl Bible : Yeah, I'll be happy to do that. So when you look at margin because we have the difference between our reported margin and core margin, we are going to have less over time accretive yield going into our margin. Now that's volatile, I would say that that could be down anywhere from two to four basis points unless accretive yield that impacts reported margin on a quarterly basis. So that trends down, it's just how much is down kind of goes back and forth from that. From a core margin perspective, our core margin is actually holding up really well. We've done really well in the past couple of quarters with that. The uncertainty we have is that how much more liquidity when you get into the balance sheet and liquidity and the balance sheet pressure to core margin. If we decide to invest in equity and securities, it gives us a little bit more NII, we view it fairly basically just trend a lot of NII. So we estimate those decisions as we go forward, but depending on how much liquidity we gain with the packages, core margin, it could be a little bit volatile. I think you have to move -- shift to net interest income and focus on net interest income and what the impacts are until that in front of there. On the fee side, I would just tell you that the business has had a lot of momentum. Insurance always is very strong in the first quarter achieving the strong quarter, but if you look at those areas in investment banking and trading, huge pipelines they had build in the fourth quarter. Kelly is right with the economy. He could have a great quarter in Joe's world and whilst they have a lot of momentum, they're adding more accounts in our retail area add traction, our community bank commercial actually is growing commercial loans and you look at the detail, I don\u2019t know if Bill or Chris want to comment on the momentum we got on the revenue on those businesses. Chris Henson : If we look at things like pipelines going forward and production in the fourth quarter, we have a reason to be optimistic that's against a headwind though of PPP paydowns and utilizations being at uniquely low level. So I think the things that we can control production pipelines are doing well and then I think we'll see the benefit of that over time whether that manifest itself in first quarter, second, third or fourth will be dependent upon all the things that will build confidence and market acceptance of where we are. Bill Rogers : I might just add opportunities we're seeing really for growth, auto is very strong right now. We were up about a $1 billion in average balances. We see that continue into the first part of the year and warehouse lending because of the environment is also very, very strong. Ken Usdin : And just one more follow-up on that 29.40 number Darrell, so is that -- it seems like to be a real landing point that you're targeting before the $70 million quarterly version of the $70 million of insurance ads just to get to the base. Without that 2940 also be inclusive of incentive comp or core underlying cost inflation. It's an absolute goal that you're trying to get around that number before we have the acquisitions and other stuff? Daryl Bible : Our fee income is still strong and all that and I have to tell you it's meaningful and have to carve it out like we did this past quarter that would be actually great story to tell you. So we will continue to try to carve out when we think it makes sense to carve out that variable comp. Obviously, we're a dynamic company and things remain, but just to be sure we're doing, but everybody understands, we're not changing our commitment. We're back on our way from the $1.6 billion that we made in February '19. We're going to get those cost savings, Operator : And we'll take our final question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Just back on the merger savings $1.6 billion year-over-year reiterating that net number that's pretty clear, you have 40% of the savings already and only 12% of the branch closures you expect to exceed on the non-branch footprint part. So why not increase that, actually what would it take to increase that estimated $1.6 billion net or have you already increased the growth merger saving number what you haven\u2019t given to us and reinvesting some of the proceeds and does that all add up to part of the operating leverage in 2021 or not, you didn\u2019t quite guide for the year, thanks. Kelly King : So Mike you're really right, the immediate parts, we're just trying to anchor on the $1.6 billion. We're not trying to hold out what we think is possible in terms of beating that but some of the things I talked about in terms of and we can have more branch closures than we've anticipated. We're not predicting that at this moment, but that's certainly a possibility. We certainly are going to be intensely focused on expense optimization and there are immediate opportunities for duplication across the enterprise areas that we can tend to invest in and reduce ongoing expense run rate. So the $1.6 billion related to basically putting the two companies together. The other things we do more in terms of transformation and additional opportunities we find whether non-branch office space, we see that target, maybe we get a few more branches. We certainly are very optimistic in terms of -- and expect to focus on doing that. We just want to be clear about what we've said we can do and then hold out we can probably beat that. Mike Mayo : With that using up my second question, in terms of the gross number, I know that you're investing a lot of that, is your growth number going higher as part of that net? Kelly King : Go ahead Daryl. Daryl Bible : So I won't tell you we are investing more than what we originally sight, but we think these are the right investments that we're making in our people, technology, digital are all for the right reasons. So we are making more investments than what we originally thought. We haven't communicated that number publicly, but just now that we are going to get our net savings maybe more clear at some point but let us get the $1.6 first and right now we are making a lot of investments in the company as we're moving forward and you're seeing it in the results. Look at our revenues, look at our account growth that we're getting and we're doing really, really well in the midst of a lot of conversion, which would really distract a lot of businesses. We are performing at a very high level. Mike Mayo : And then second question, a lot of talk about the -- lot of talk about insurance, and bringing in the big guns with my peer colleague my firm insurance count spoken with the insurance managers, I want to ask the question on my behalf, go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : So the one question I had, you guys posted 5% adjusted organic growth in the fourth quarter which seems like a pretty impressive number relative to some of the other companies that cover and then also given the impacts that we see from COVID on the industry, as you guide about 2021 and some of your other comments, it seems like growth will continue on an organic basis right to kind of should come in above that 5%. It is really just mainly expand there. And then also could you give us a sense of you guys a little bit different others obviously have good feel of wholesale and retail in your insurance business and the organic front both of those businesses as once they've been outperforming versus the other or are they consistent? Chris Henson : Thanks for the question, this is Chris. You're right, we did finish around 5% and based on what I see now, I think around 5% would be certainly a good number for call it the first half of next year. We call it the last half when we give the quarter in or so. So we feel very, very good about it but I must tell you if pricing holds and I believe that it will and if the economy does begin to turn via vaccinations getting pushed out to the country and we're able to see then better new business growth as a result, some example of what we saw in the fourth quarter, could it be better, I think it's possible that it could. So I think the opportunity really kind all the cylinders have opportunity to move. I do think that growth is going to be dependent upon what happens with COVID and the economy and kind of get all that going, but certainly we do get vaccinated out stimulus first half of the year, I think it bodes well for organic growth in that business for sure and your question about is the margin better than one than the other, strategically as a bank, the reason we want exposure to both, if we want to bank, it probably wouldn\u2019t matter as much, but what we're really interested in is for this business to provide good downside protection when credit markets are challenging and you can see it this year this past year, 4.3% organic growth for the year I think is pretty solid given the backdrop. And the reason we do that is because the wholesale and retail is going to operate in difference to each other. So you're going to depending on whether you're in hard in soft market, one it is going to help balance the other that we're interested in the combination of the growth there. So certainly a little bit better contribution from wholesale today than retail, but they're making nice contribution. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions. I'd like to turn the conference back to Mr. Ryan Richards for any additional or closing remarks. Ryan Richards : Okay. That complete the Q&A portion of our call. Thank you, Abby and thank you everyone for joining us today. I apologize to those with questions that we didn't have time to get to. We will reach out to you later today and we wish you all the best. Goodbye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Alan Greer of Investor Relations. Alan Greer : Thank you, Katie and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. We have our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Kelly King; President and COO, Bill Rogers; and CFO, Daryl Bible who will highlight a number of strategic priorities and discuss Truist's first quarter 2021 results. Chris Henson, Head of Banking and Insurance; and Clarke Starnes, our Chief Risk Officer will also participate in the Q&A portion of our call. The accompanying presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the Truist Investor Relations website. Our presentation today does include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on slides two and three of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix for appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. We also want to note that Ryan Richards, the former Head of Director of Investor Relations has left Truist to pursue an opportunity outside of the company. If you have questions following today's call please contact me or Aaron Reeves in Investor Relations. Our contact information is on the cover of the earnings release. And with that I'll turn it over to Kelly. Kelly King : Thanks Alan and good morning everybody. Thank you very much for joining our call. We had overall I consider a strong quarter with strong earnings and returns, very good expense control, strong fee income, especially in insurance and investment banking; excellent asset quality which Clarke will talk about, really good progress on merger integration, and excellent internal recognitions including an outstanding CRA rating for our community development efforts. If you're following along on slide four, we always like to focus on the most important which is our culture. As you've heard us say many times we continue to reiterate culture as the primary determinant of our long-term success. Our purpose really connects with our teammates. We've been really excited about this. Our teammates are driven to really help our clients. We really enjoy serving our communities and our shareholders. Even with COVID we've made great progress in activating our culture, created a cultural council which works every day with our EL team causing our culture to really come alive. So, we made excellent progress in terms of culture which is ultimately the driver. On slide five just a couple of points on some things that I think are good with regard to how we are serving our communities. We were very excited to be the first issuer of a social bond of the US regional banks $1.25 billion bond. It was well well-received 120 investors, very favorable pricing. We're very excited about that in terms of our ability to focus on affordable housing and other community needs. We became the lead investor for Greenwood which is very excited and innovative digital banking platform designed for Black and Latino consumers and business owners. We signed the Hispanic Promise a first-of-its-kind national pledge to prepare, hire, promote, retain, and celebrate Hispanics in the workplace. And we received 100% score in Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index and we were named the Best Place to Work in 2021. We also continue to make great progress in terms of executing on our $60 billion community benefits agreement and we are already at 114% of our annual target. We were very proud to be recognized once again by Fortune as one of the world's most admired companies. On slide six just a few indicators for you about how well the merger is going. I just want to point out to you that the risk of executing our merger has already been reduced substantially and is going down daily as we do conversions and we're getting a lot of the actual merger work done. A huge amount of work has already been done on the core bank conversion. And you'll see in the bubble chart there that a number of conversion has already been done. For example Truist Securities conversion, wealth brokerage conversion. We did a huge amount of work in terms of grading all of the Truist jobs and that has all been executed. We're already in the process of testing protocols for our core bank conversion. A wealth trust conversion is well along occurring in just a few weeks. So, you see that we're making tremendous progress on it. I just want to emphasize the point that for those who think that the risk is going to remain high and won't subside until we do the final branch conversion that is not a good way to look at it. The risk is being mitigated daily as we do these various conversions and make progress in terms of preparing for the final conversion. We did close 226 branches in the first quarter which is part of our strategy. We have been very, very happy with our teammate reaction to that. They're very, very engaged. Recall that we promised all of our client-facing performing teammates that they would not lose their jobs and so it's going very, very well. And our clients are very supportive because remember most of these branches are very, very close to each other and so it's no inconvenience to our clients. We are very focused on meeting our expense targets, which Daryl will talk about and we believe we will be able to accomplish that. Just a few performance highlights on 7A. I think it was a very, very good quarter. We had strong adjusted net income of $1.6 billion or $1.18 per share adjusted both up 42% versus the first quarter of 2020. We had adjusted ROTCE of 19.36%. Recall that we said our mid-term target was in the low 20s so we are well on the way to achieving that already and we have huge cost savings yet to come. We recorded investment banking and trading income at a record level along with insurance. It was offset some by decreases in residential mortgage income and commercial real estate-related income. Strong expense discipline as our adjusted non-interest expense decreased $57 million sequentially and our merger-related and restructuring charges decreased $167 million. We significantly had lower provision for credit losses of $48 million versus $177 million in the fourth quarter so we had a reserve release of $190 million. Clarke can talk about that a little more if we have questions. NPAs decreased $88 million or 6.3%, which we were very happy about. We completed $506 million of share repurchases so we had a total payout for the quarter of about 83%. We did redeem $950 million of preferred stock during the quarter at an after-tax cost of $26 million or $0.02 per share, which was not excluded in terms of our adjustment to net income. So overall, if you look at slide 8 you'll see how the adjustments worked with the merger-related charges having a diluting impact of $0.08; incremental operating expenses related to the merger that are not in our ongoing recurring charges going forward was $0.10; and an acceleration for cash flow hedge underlying expense of $0.02. So overall it was a very strong quarter across a wide array of performance areas. Importantly, we continue to execute on our T3 concept, which is the concept of seamlessly integrating technology and touch so that we yield a high level of trust creating a very high value proposition, which is providing excellent client focus which is ultimately the most important factor in terms of judging our current and our future performance. Now let me turn it to Bill on some additional detail. Bill? Bill Rogers : Great. Kelly, thank you and good morning, everyone. As you can see from page 9, our clients continue to adopt digital at a rapid pace. Since last March, the population of active mobile app users has increased 11% to more than four million users. That marks an important milestone along our digital journey as a company. We're absolutely committed to meeting our clients where they are. And increasingly, these interactions are happening in the digital space. Our digital commerce data bear this out, as digital client needs have met -- digital client needs met have improved 44% since the first quarter of 2020 and represent more than one-third of total bank production of core bank products this percentage is even higher when you include LightStream and Mortgage. As we accompany clients along their digital journey we often interact with them across multiple digital products and services. Mobile Check Deposits and Zelle are two examples both of which were up significantly from a year ago and this just creates additional opportunities to deepen those relationships. Importantly, the increase in digital transaction activity allows our teammates to spend less time on manual execution and more time assessing and meeting client needs enabled by our integrated relationship management. We're also excited about the new Truist digital experience that is rolling out to our clients later this year. In order to complete the digital migration ahead of the core bank conversion, we're utilizing an innovative proprietary approach known as a Digital Straddle. The Digital Straddle allows us to migrate clients to the new digital experience in waves, reducing migration risk as Kelly discussed earlier and avoiding a onetime migration early next year. We recently launched a successful internal pilot of our new digital experience and expect to migrate our clients in a series of waves during the third and fourth quarter. Let me now turn to slide 10, talk about loans. First quarter balance sheet dynamics reflected a combination of mild loan demand, ongoing government stimulus and elevated liquidity. Average loans decreased $8.2 billion compared to the fourth quarter primarily due to a $4.5 billion reduction in commercial balances and $3 billion of residential mortgage runoff. The decrease in commercial loan balance was primarily attributable to lower revolver utilization and continued pay-down of PPP loans, which outpaced new loan commitments. Approximately $3.3 billion of PPP loans were repaid during the quarter impacting average commercial balances by $1.8 billion. Revolver utilization remained low as clients continue to hold elevated liquidity and access to capital markets. In addition, the dealer floor plan portfolio continues to experience headwinds related to supply chain disruptions. Average consumer loans decreased $3.6 billion, as ongoing refinance activity impacted residential mortgage, home equity and direct loan balances. These declines though were partially offset by higher indirect auto balances, which benefited from strong production, especially in the prime segment. We made a conscious decision in support of our purpose to lean in on PPP loans and we've been the largest lender in many of our markets. And while revolver utilization is at an all-time lows, our commitments are steady. Also acknowledge that our prime mortgage portfolio is more susceptible to higher prepayments. We recognize these are headwinds but we're also optimistic that given vaccination rates, government stimulus and our own view of productivity and pipelines, all supported economic recovery and corresponding core loan growth. Let me switch to the next page and talk about deposits. Average deposits increased $7.9 billion sequentially and are up more than $28 billion from the first quarter of 2020 reflecting government stimulus and pandemic-related client behavior. Average balances increased across all deposit categories except time deposits. While the largest increases were in interest checking and money market and savings, the deposit mix remains favorable, as non-interest-bearing accounts represent one-third of total deposits. Truist continues to experience strong deposit growth while maximizing our value proposition to clients, outside of rate paid, as we continue to experience net new household growth. During the first quarter, average total deposits costs decreased two basis points to five basis points and average interest-bearing deposit costs declined four basis points to seven basis points. Due to new stimulus, we're up double-digits in total deposits since the quarter end. And with that, let me turn it over to Daryl to discuss the overall financial performance. Daryl Bible : Thank you, Bill and good morning, everybody. Continuing on Slide 12. Net interest income decreased $81 million linked quarter, due to fewer days, lower purchase accounting accretion and lower earning asset yields. Reported net interest margin was down seven basis points reflecting a four basis point impact from lower purchase accounting accretion. Core net interest margin decreased three basis points, as deposit inflows resulted in higher combined Fed balances and securities. Interest sensitivity decreased slightly as the investment portfolio grew in response to the elevated liquidity. Turning to Slide 13. Non-interest income decreased $88 million, despite record income from insurance and investment banking and trading. Insurance income increased $81 million linked quarter reflecting seasonality, $28 million from recent acquisitions and $19 million due to a timing change related to certain employee benefit accounts. Organic revenue grew 6.4% due to strong new business, stable retention and higher property and casualty rates. Investment banking and trading rose $32 million, benefiting from strength in high yield investment grade and equity originations, as well as a recovery in CVA. Residential mortgage income decreased $93 million, due to lower production margins and volumes. Commercial real estate income decreased $80 million, due to seasonality and strong fourth quarter transaction activity. Other income was down $18 million, as lower partnership income was partially offset by gains from our divestiture. Continuing on Slide 14. Expense discipline remained strong in the first quarter. Non-interest expense was down $223 million linked quarter, reflecting $167 million decrease in merger-related and restructuring charges. Adjusted non-interest expense decreased $57 million, primarily due to lower professional fees and non-service-related pension costs offset by personnel expense. Personnel expense increased $34 million, reflecting higher equity-based compensation higher incentive compensation, and payroll tax resets, partially offset by lower salaries and wages. Turning to slide 15. We are taking full advantage of our unique opportunity to build the best of both franchise. The best of both is harder to execute on a typical acquisition, but we are convinced that the client benefits and internal efficiencies justify the effort and expense. As we said in January, we continue to expect total combined merger costs of approximately $4 billion. This consists of merger-related and restructuring charges of approximately $2.1 billion and incremental operating expenses related to the merger of approximately $1.8 billion. These costs are not in the future run rate and will come out in 2022 after we complete the core bank conversion and decommission redundant systems. Since the merger was announced, we have incurred $1.3 billion of merger-related and restructuring charges, and $900 million incremental operating expenses related to the merger. Continuing on slide 16. Strong asset quality matrix remained relatively stable, reflecting diversification benefits from the merger and effective problem asset resolution. Non-performing assets were down $88 million or two basis points as a percentage of total loans, largely driven by decreases in the commercial and industrial portfolio. Net charge-offs came in 33 basis points, which was at the lower end of the guidance range. Linked-quarter increase was mostly driven by seasonality in indirect auto. The provision for credit losses was $48 million, including a reserve release of $190 million due to lower loan balances and improved economic outlook. The allowance for credit losses was relatively stable at 2.06% of loans and leases. Our exposure of COVID-sensitive industries was essentially flat at $27 billion. Turning to slide 17. Truist has strong capital and ended the first quarter with a CET1 ratio of 10.1%. With respect to capital return, we paid a common dividend of $0.45 per share and had $506 million of share buybacks. We also redeemed $950 million of preferred stock, resulting in an after-tax charge of $26 million, or $0.02 per share that was not excluded from the adjusted results. We have $1.5 billion in repurchase authorization remaining under the share repurchase program the Board approved in December. We intend to maintain approximate 10% CET1 ratio after taking into account strategic actions, stock repurchases, and changes in risk-weighted assets. As a result, we anticipate second quarter repurchases of about $600 million. We continue to have strong liquidity, and are ready to meet the needs of our clients and communities. Continuing on slide 18. This slide shows excellent progress towards the net cost saves of $1.6 billion. Through the first quarter, we reduced sourceable spend 9.3%, and are closing in on our 10% target. In terms of retail banking, we closed 226 branches in the first quarter bringing the cumulative closures to 374. We are on track to close approximately 800 branches by the first quarter of 2022. We reduced our non-branch facilities by approximately 3.5 million square feet, and are making progress towards the overall target of approximately five million square feet. Average FTEs are down 9% since the merger announcement. We expect technology savings of $425 million by the end of 2022 compared to 2019. We continue to look at these expense buckets and are broadening to look at other across the board. We are highly committed to our $1.6 billion cost savings target. Continuing to slide 19. The waterfall on the left shows that, we measure core expenses and cost savings. Beginning with adjusted non-interest expense and then adjusting for the nonqualified plan and the insurance acquisition expenses, we arrived at a core expense of $3.065 billion. If you adjust for seasonality of high payroll taxes, equity compensation and variable commissions, core expenses would approach fourth quarter target of $2.940 [ph] billion. Our adjusted return on tangible common equity was 19.36% for the first quarter. We maintained our medium-term performance and cost saving targets for 2021 and 2022. Further moderation of the merger and economic risk may enable us to revisit our target CET1 ratio. Now I will provide guidance for the second quarter expressed in linked quarter changes. We expect taxable-equivalent revenue excluding security gains to be relatively flat. We expect reported net interest margin to be down high single-digits driven by a mid single-digit decrease in core margin and three to four basis points of purchase accounting accretion runoff. Net interest income should be relatively flat due to the growth of the balance sheet. Non-interest expense adjusted for merger costs and amortization expected to be relatively flat. We anticipate net charge-offs in the range of 30 to 45 basis points and a tax rate between 19% to 20%. As you look out into 2021, our prudent economic conditions may allow for further reserve releases. Overall, we had a strong quarter including excellent expense management and strong asset quality. Now, let me hand it back to Bill for an update on IRM. Bill Rogers : Thanks, Daryl. And I'm going to take us to Page 20. I'm going to take this opportunity to share our progress on Integrated Relationship Management and share two examples of what we call natural fit businesses working together to benefit our clients. When Truist was formed, we said we'd create value by combining our distinctive client-focused banking experiences with greater investment in technology and a stronger mix of financial services offerings. As Kelly noted earlier, we called this approach T3 touch integrated with technology equals trust. We're confident in the strategy because it really builds on Truist's strengths. Those strengths include industry-leading client service and loyalty; an advice-based business model; differentiated offerings including Truist Securities, Truist Insurance Holdings and the Truist Leadership institute; and leading technology like our mobile banking app. Integrated Relationship Management is a framework for putting T3 into practice across Truist, through all of our lines of businesses and most importantly for all of our clients. We start with the client, understand their needs, and engage our business partners through our common technology-based referral and accountability process. As mentioned, we have natural synergies such as the relationship between Commercial Community Bank and Truist Securities. This business is by nature a little lumpy and episodic driven by client needs, but we're very pleased with our momentum. Referrals are up by a factor of three in one year and have more than doubled since the last quarter. We continue to train bankers and are increasing both the number and quality of referrals. As we share client wins, teammates gain confidence and motivation to fully leverage all the tools that we have for the benefit of their like clients. Moving to Slide 21 and discuss the effort of Truist Securities and Truist Insurance Holdings and the relationship with heritage SunTrust clients in particular. Referrals to insurance have increased more than 2.3 times compared to the first quarter of 2020 and more than 50% sequentially. We've aligned systems and trained around similar practice groups, which allows us to double down on industry expertise for our clients. I can really speak from experience if this was a real area of excitement from heritage SunTrust and this is really just in the early stages of growth. So Integrated Relationship Management is working. It's been embraced fully by our teammates. It's in support of our clients and a distinguishable benefit for our shareholders. Keep in mind, this is a long game, but you do see the beginning of this incremental opportunity in the overall insurance and investment banking results even in this quarter. So Kelly, let me turn that back over to you. Kelly King : Thank you, Bill. I appreciate that. So on Slide 22, I just want to point out and reemphasize our value proposition. We believe it is a very strong value proposition driven by our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities.  We have an exceptional franchise with diverse products, services and markets some of the best in the world. We are uniquely positioned to deliver best-in-class efficiency and returns while investing in the future and you're seeing that happening already. We have very strong capital and liquidity position with very strong resilience in terms of our risk profile enhanced by the merger.  So we have a growing earnings stream with less volatility relative to many of our peers over the long-term. So if you think about the quarter in all and overall and wrapping up, I'd just say again, I think it was a very strong quarter. It's a very interesting and challenging times, but look things are getting better. COVID is getting better. It's too soon to declare this over, but hospitalization rates are down and infection rates are down and vaccines are getting out really, really fast. So we're encouraged by that. The economy is clearly improving.  We've said before and I would reemphasize, we believe as we head into the second half, we will have a snapback economy. This economy was not wounded before we headed into this, we simply shut it down for appropriate reasons. Now we're beginning to see the opportunities that we believe could happen, which is turning it back on as easy than it might have been under other types of economic crisis that we've seen.  So Truist is positioned really, really well. We have a great culture. We have great markets. We have a great team. We have a great purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities and it's creating really engaged teammates.  We have real benefits from the merger that are being realized every single day. You've heard some of those. We have very strong performance in T3 and IRM as Bill described and that's really powerful. The merger integration is on track. We are reducing risk every single day. It's all going really, really well. We believe we have the opportunity to accelerate into what I consider to be a very positive snapback economy. We fully believe our best days are ahead. Alan? Alan Greer : Okay. Thank you, Kelly. Katie, at this time if you would come back on the line and explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Kelly, Bill. How are you? Kelly King : Hi, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Can you kind of share with us, if you look at the credit outlook for your company and the industry, we've seen an incredible reduction in the credit cycle because of the policies pursued by the Federal Reserve and the US government last year. Can you guys give us your thoughts on how you see credit cycles going forward? Are they permanently potentially flattened because of what we saw last year? Or is this just such an aberration that we shouldn't read into what we're seeing with this lowered flatter credit cycle? Kelly King : I would say and Clarke can add some details on that, Gerard. I don't believe this eliminates ongoing long-term credit cycles. I mean, I think to believe that you would have to believe that we have somehow fixed the economy and fixed the nature of humans making decisions and humans getting greedy and humans indulging in excesses. I do not believe that has gone away nor will it go away.  Once we flush through this massive amounts of stimulus into the economy, we will undoubtedly see some excesses. It will likely lead to some corrections down the road that nobody is projecting now and I don't project it in the next two, three years, but there will be some excesses created out of all this excessive money into the system. So we have had a -- heading into the pandemic, we had about a 10-year kind of steady economy. Most people would say and including myself, we were probably heading into a correction.  Now we've had what will be two, three years of COVID experience. We haven't had a correction because of these excesses. That will flow in two, three years. So we'll end up with about a 15- or 16-year protracted period relatively stable ex-out the blip from COVID. But then we'll go back to fairly normal kind of economic variations in my view. Clarke, what do you think? Clarke Starnes : I agree. The credit stress was resulting from the shutdown of the economy not underlying credit considerations that you would normally see. So we've been around a long time credit cycles will come and go. [Indiscernible] involved inherent risk is going to have a credit cycle in the future. So that's why you always have to stick to your long-term underwriting principles. And you can't ever forget there will be another credit cycle [side of retailing] [ph]. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Bill Rogers : And maybe just add to that\u2026 Gerard Cassidy : Go ahead, Bill. Bill Rogers : Gerard, maybe just add to that is, keeping our diversified balance sheet is the key to that. So, we're not going to lose our discipline and [blink] [ph] because of this cycle. And we want to anticipate a highly diversified business and a strong capital base to fulfill our value proposition. Gerard Cassidy : Very good, and then, as a follow-up your franchise obviously is located in some of the stronger economies in the U.S. particularly economies that are more open than some of the coastal economies in the North. Can you share with us the outlook for, if you look beyond the current quarter and look out into the second half of the year about loan growth and loan demand, I know there's excessive liquidity? You touched on it Kelly. What do you guys see the turning points where you could see an acceleration of loan growth possibly in the third or fourth quarters of this year? Bill Rogers : Yes. Gerard, I'll take that. I think, first of all, what you noted is exactly right about our franchise. I mean, I think, whatever happens and whenever it happens, I think, we'll be disproportionately positively benefited. So I think we'll sort of be the first in that cycle. And we see that not only in case of markets being more open but just the migration. I mean the migration of companies, and the migration of individuals. I don't think that's quite showing up in the data yet, but that's going to show up, because we absolutely, absolutely feel that. That being said, if we start so to say the second quarter is the starting period for loan growth, I think it's reasonable to think that sort of core loan growth, let's exclude PPP from that, because we're a little over weighted in PPPs. So we've got paydowns related to that. If we look at core loan growth, I think we have reasons to be positive for the latter part of the year, in virtually all of our businesses. So maybe CRE being the loan stand -- example on the opposite side. But core C&I, and then the growth in mortgage and then businesses like LightStream and indirect auto and others that are more positively inclined. I think your general premise is right. And I think we're well positioned. And I think that's the latter half of the year phenomenon. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi. The specific question is can you give an update on the annualized cost savings as a percentage of the ultimate target? It was $640 million annualized in the fourth quarter versus the target of $1.6 billion. And along with that, you're still sticking to $29 billion of expenses by the fourth quarter. That's down, despite an increase in volume-based expenses such as for insurance and capital markets. And why is that? And if that's the case why wouldn't you be updating your ultimate merger expense saving target? Daryl Bible : Yes, Mike. That's a great question. If you take our -- on the slide that we had in the deck and look at what our core expenses are the $3.065 billion. And if you back out the seasonality that we had in the first quarter, due to the payroll, tax resets and the equity that's about $50 million there, we're probably at $3.015 billion give or take a little bit there. We did have higher incentives. Higher incentives this quarter were really driven by our performance in revenues and just overall great performance throughout the company. So, I kind of carve that out. But from a core perspective I think, we continue to make good progress. We are totally committed to getting to the $2.940 billion that we talked about last quarter. We're on track to get there. If you noticed in our comments, we said, we're looking at these five buckets, but we're also broadening out and looking at other areas as well. And we are going to hit our targets for sure. And if we exceed those targets we will continue to make good investments in the company to continue to compete and win in the industry. Mike Mayo : Okay. Before I use up my second question, so the $640 million annualized, have you updated that for the first quarter or no? Daryl Bible : We say, updated it. It's -- we really just gave targets for the fourth quarter. It's going to be lumpy. But it's hard to project a trajectory down every quarter just because of you have a real business that's dynamic and moving. But we made good progress in fourth quarter to first quarter. And we will get our target by the fourth quarter this year. Mike Mayo : Okay. And the second question since insurance is such a standout and I had our firm's insurance analyst Elyse Greenspan to ask the follow-up. Elyse Greenspan : Yes. So I was hoping to get some color within insurance on the organic growth on -- it is up to 6.4% in the quarter. On the last quarter call you guys had pointed to 5% for the first half of the year. So I guess what's coming in better than you had expected? And how do you see the rest of the year progressing from here? Chris Henson : Sure Elyse. This is Chris Henson. We did have a very exciting organic growth number. The elements of it would be pricing retention and new business. I would say pricing was not of what I'd call a continued surprise. The balance increased around 7%. We think rates are generally going to be anticipated to continue increasing throughout 2021. Retention we did level off in retail. So we're just under 91%. We were having a little drift down. As you know we're in that time of the market where a lot of that risk gets shifted to the wholesale segment. Wholesale is actually up to 84.6%. So retention actually continued to perform just maybe a touch better. And we do continue to see that shift to wholesale. New business would be an area I would point to that might have been in a brighter spot than we would have seen a quarter ago. New business production was up 12.8% which is very solid. And what we saw in the quarter was every month that got better. February was better than January, March was better than February et cetera. And that's kind of what drove the 6.4% of organic. And I would also piggyback on the comment Bill made earlier, IRM is actually -- is real. It's having an impact. And when we say that they're linked pretty heavily to the Commercial Community Bank CIG wealth Retail Community Bank, we're actually spending time talking about that and making sure we have aligned with expectations in place and that's having a marginal impact as well. In terms of outlook, the second quarter we'd expect commissions to be up about 3%. We're moving out of the first quarter which is our second highest quarter of the year into our seasonally strongest which is Q2. And certainly, while there's still uncertainties the COVID impact, it's going to have on the economy etcetera we think the outlook is still very positive in this business because we think we're going to continue to see increased pricing. We haven't seen a lot of failures in business so we think we're going to continue to see stable exposure units. E&S volumes are still strong. So -- and given that we are diversified in both wholesale and retail it really helps us in this type of market. So we think pricing momentum will be -- continue to guide us for all the reasons we talked about : COVID cat losses etcetera. And in this quarter pricing being up in the 7% range it was flat with Q4. We did see an umbrella in excess of 14% DNO over 11.5% for example professional liability of 11%. But another area where we benefit disproportionately is commercial property. Commercial property was up 8.5%. We have a lot of that. That's very helpful to us. And of course there's all the coverage classes. About half of the coverage classes were up. And all account sizes were up in the 6.5% to 8.5% kind of range. So I would say for next quarter our outlook would be mid-single-digit organic growth. Even given the uncertainties there we feel very solid about that as we kind of move through. And we think there's upside in terms of the economy continued to benefit to drive even stronger new business. And I think we continue to mature as Bill pointed out with respect to our IRM process and that gives us a good positive growth as well. We did close one small acquisition in the quarter and we certainly expect to be open to do more of those throughout the balance of the year as well. So on balance we're really good about the prospects for the balance of 2021. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Daryl Bible : Hey, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Just the first question I just wanted to make sure I understood the expense guide for 2Q because I think you mentioned Daryl relatively flat Q-on-Q. And I wanted to understand if that was right and maybe some of the things that you're thinking about that keep it flat instead of maybe coming down a little bit. Daryl Bible : Yes, Betsy. In my prepared remarks, we did say that we thought expenses on the adjusted basis backing out the merger and restructuring incremental MOE would come in relatively flat. I think we continue to make good progress in the buckets that we're showing and we are starting to broaden out in other areas. We will have higher revenue and fees in certain areas just because of seasonal strength in the second quarter. But net-net we feel pretty good on how the quarter is going to come in and from an expense perspective. I think we're on a good trajectory and we're going to hit our targets. Betsy Graseck : And so from what I'm hearing from the prior conversation too is that the expense improvement acceleration is picking up as you move through the year. Daryl Bible : That would be the anticipation. Betsy Graseck : And then just separately on the revenue side. I know you haven't baked in the revenue synergies, but I just wanted to get a sense as to whether or not you could speak to what you're seeing so far in terms of picking up new accounts or expanding the product set of the accounts that you're with relative to what maybe your budgets or goals have been so far. I know COVID kind of put a wrench in that, but maybe you could speak to how you're migrating at this stage. Bill Rogers : Yes. Betsy, it's Bill. I think as I said earlier, you see that in the core results. I mean, sort of the penetration that we're experiencing the referral volume that we're experiencing you probably see it most acutely in the results in investment banking and in insurance. But it's really sort of if you look at sort of the overall revenue line. It's really everywhere, I mean. So we've been careful about pointing out one specific revenue synergy against one specific thing because that's not the goal. The goal is to expand all of our relationships. The goal is to listen to our clients put a integrated system together have it the highly technology supported one platform with really good accountability and strong teammate by them. And that's the value proposition. So I think the real answer is just see it in the overall results. Again, I pointed out too that we're more acutely obvious, but literally in all of our businesses you see the advantages of what we're implementing as part of the Truist value proposition. Chris Henson : Betsy, I'll tag on to that. Sorry, Betsy, I was just going to tag on just saying in the commercial community bank for example, we saw referral activity up 15% this past quarter, which is a really good number of household growth in all the commercial segments. So I think it's a function of what Bill was saying we're just beginning to see movement sort of across the board. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Yes. That was kind of my question in particular post. As we've been reopening, do you feel like that has been picking up? And then I can hear in your answer it seems like the answer is yes. Bill Rogers : Yes, absolutely. Yes. That's the other part of your question, yes. That's to the -- I think we're again experiencing that a little disproportionately. We're probably leading the country in terms of reopening and reactivity. And we feel that in virtually all of our businesses. Chris Henson : We came into the first quarter of last year with a lot of excitement. And then second quarter with COVID, we all just sort of hit a wall. But the excitement sort of perseveres through the balance of the year. We just seen I think to a degree just consistent improvement sort of month-by-month. Betsy Graseck : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Daryl Bible : Hi, Matt. Matt O\u2019Connor: Hi. Can you guys talk a bit about your strategy of deploying liquidity in the securities? Last quarter you purchased a lot of securities a little bit less so this quarter. What's kind of just the philosophy and capacity as we look forward? Daryl Bible : Yes. Right now Matt what we are doing is we are investing our excess liquidity that we've gotten in from our deposits. But we're averaging about $20 billion at the Fed which we think is a comfortable cushion to basically handle any volatility we might get there. The investments we're making is a combination of mortgage-backed securities and U.S. treasuries. We are averaging up a little bit on the yields that we have on the portfolio that we have out there today from that perspective. So I think the way we think about it is, we're going to have liquidity for a fair amount of time. And we're going to have cash flows. And kind of dovetailing into what Bill said earlier, the best thing that could happen to us is loan growth starts to pick up second quarter into the second half of the year. And we basically runoff some securities that are in the mid-1% ranges and we reinvest them into loans in the 2% to 4% 5% or 6% range and basically keep the balance sheet about the same size and just improve our revenue and earnings overall. So I think that would be the strategy for us to do that. If, for whatever reason that the Fed starts to shrink their balance sheet and liquidity comes out, you got to remember, we have $8 billion to $10 billion of cash flows coming off this portfolio every quarter that we can absorb anything. So, I think, we're taking good balanced risk. Our target right now is to keep net interest income, even with the runoff of purchase accounting flat for the next several quarters. And, hopefully, that will pick up towards the end of the year, as we get meaningful loan growth. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Thanks. And then, I just wanted to follow up on the last question, so you got questions regarding revenue synergies. I understand, kind of, pushing at all the businesses and not trying to necessarily, kind of, track it separately. But as we think longer term and the opportunities become a little more apparent and, I guess, I'm thinking loan growth picks up and there's some loans that legacy BBT offered that SunTrust didn't and vice versa, it would seem like the numbers could start being a little more material. And I think what I see is, over time you might provide more details on the magnitude of the synergies. So far you talked about kind of capital market pricing some of that in the fourth quarter. But bringing it all together over time is that something you'd consider? Kelly King : Matt, I think, we will definitely do that. We're trying to provide timely information on those marginally important issues. But as Bill and Chris illustrated, we really have a broad-based opportunity, not just loan, deposits, all types of fee income. Now we are really just scratching the surface. The reason we keep emphasizing this IRM concept is because, that is the most powerful concept and we think we have an edge on that, because it focuses on all of the clients' needs all of the time. We build a culture where everybody works together. We built systems to allow for information to be integrated across organizational boundaries. And so, yes, you're right. I think you bet, it can be positive in terms of expected revenue enhances as we go forward, as we begin to penetrate more of our clients' needs. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Hi. Good morning. Bill Rogers : Good morning. Erika Najarian : My question is, as you think about the prospects for loan growth bouncing back for the rest of the year, could you remind us how many of your clients are either non-investment grade, or don't have a debt rating? I guess the big struggle investors have is the capital markets are wide open, private equity firms continue to be aggressive in private credit and sort of, wondering what that universe is of your clients that potentially would need a bank balance sheet in order to expand. Bill Rogers : Yes. Erika, this is Bill. The key is to have a really balanced portfolio. So there we have a good number of clients who won't access the capital markets. That's sort of that core strength of that middle market community banking model and they'll use bank loans as their primary avenue for growth. Then you see the other side of that, but I don't think that's the only equation. If rates go up, certainly on the long end, you can see large corporates going back to bank loans. They are the most efficient way of borrowing. We've got a lot of revolvers out. Just a little bit of revolver utilization increase is a pretty significant loan driver for us. So I don't think we necessarily think about it as the non-investment grade, the investment grade in terms of a separation. We think about it in terms of the balanced portfolio and we drive it from the client needs. So, if the client wants capital markets and that's the most efficient way, we have great access and great capability and great products. For those that want to have a bank product, we've got a great portfolio of those tight middle-market clients and are able to serve them. So, I think our optimism is really predicated on just this concept of a balanced portfolio versus one versus the other. Does that make sense? Erika Najarian : Yes, it does. And I think Bill that's a great point on loan rates rising and revolvers becoming more attractive. I think that has -- that point hasn't been made as vocally, so thank you for that. And the follow-up question is, clearly, consumers and corporates are awash with cash. Do you expect that those cash balances have to be drawn before corporates, especially re-lever? Or do you -- are your clients telling you that they're going to keep a little bit more cash on hand, given what they went through during the pandemic? Bill Rogers : Erika, I think everybody is trying to figure out the answer to that question. You've got a consumer and business. I'll comment on business and Chris can comment on the consumer. I think, what you're going to see is that, businesses are going to end up maintaining more liquidity than you would expect, as they begin to weigh in on new credit facilities, whether it's capital markets or whether it's bank balance sheets. And the reason is because I think you're going to see leaders of businesses that -- were very unnerved with the Great Recession. And then just a few years later got very unnerved with the COVID experience. The end result of that is going to be psychologically a very reserved view. And that argues for maintaining liquidity even as you're borrowing. So, I personally expect that you're going to see borrowing increase faster than most people expect, as we head into the latter part of this year and still maintain liquidity. Erika Najarian : Thank you. Chris Henson : Consumer what we're seeing -- Erika, for consumer, what we're seeing right now is checking balances are about 30% higher and savings balances are up 140%. Obviously, a lot of that's driven by stimulus. But for lending to occur, there's got to be demand. And I think, we are seeing spending now on nondiscretionary type things which -- I mean at discretionary type of thing excuse me. And I think when cash depletes, there will be more lending, but it is tough today for home equity type products as a result of all these payments. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning everyone. I just wanted to follow up on the fee income side, I think embedded within your kind of flat revenues and flattish NII, kind of flattish fees. And Chris had talked about the plus 3-ish percent outlook for insurance. So, just wanted to understand, given that there was a gain in there too this quarter, just what are some of the other moving parts of fees as you look out? Well Daryl, you had sounded very optimistic at the beginning of the year about the outlook for fees. And just wondering what you think continues to be the other positives and then some things that might be settling back out off of recent strengths? Thank you. Daryl Bible : Yes, Ken. From a fee perspective, I think insurance, as Chris said, will have its largest quarter of the year in the second quarter, so that will be strong. Second quarter activity is usually strong in the payments area in activity. So I think all of those will be relatively strong. I think, we're calling for tighter margins in our mortgage area. So that I think even though we'll have higher volumes, we might have lower revenues there potentially. And then if you look into the investment banking and trading areas, we did have a CVA adjustment this past quarter. For that to continue, we have to have rates continue going up. We don't really have a good prediction, if rates are going to go up or not next quarter or not. So we're just kind of saying that's relatively flat. They do have strong pipeline flow in the M&A area and other pieces. So net-net, I think they'll still be strong, but CVA was a benefit for us this past quarter. But I think overall Ken, we feel pretty good about fees. And right now, we're saying relatively flat and we'll just see how the quarter unveils and hopefully we can beat that performance. Ken Usdin : Got it. Great. And secondly, you've teased out before this potential to relook at that 10% CET1. And obviously, getting through the rest of the pandemic would probably be priority one. But what are the other factors that you need to continue to evaluate that? And could it be a big delta? Or are you talking about just modest changes as you continue to tighten up on what this company looks like over the long term? Thanks. Kelly King : Yes. So Ken you've heard us say that the relationship between capital and risk is what drives our capital decisions. Going into the merger and up to the current moment, we've judged that the risk externally were substantial. We adjusted the risk of making sure we do the merger right or material. And so as we look forward what we see is that the risk externally are mitigating, COVID is mitigating, economic risk are mitigating. So certainly it's not some huge substantial event that we don't anticipate. The external factors are mitigating meaningfully internally. As I described earlier the risks are reducing daily. And so it does set forward the opportunity for us to have some capital actions that can be attractive to our shareholders. It's hard to judge right now the materiality of that because you literally have to take it a day at a time. One thing we should have all learned is projecting out in this kind of environment six months or nine months now is just not rational, and so you have to kind of take it more carefully. But as we do, as we see risk began to continue to materially mitigate, we do have meaningful opportunity in terms of capital deployment. Ken Usdin : Got it. Thank you, Kelly. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Good morning. Kelly King : Morning. John Pancari : On the margin front, I know you guided to some incremental compression in the second quarter and then in the fourth quarter saw some -- a big greater pressure than expected I think. How should we think about a bottoming of the margin? When do you think that could materialize? Should we expect that for the third quarter? And maybe give us some thoughts around what could drive that. Thank you. Daryl Bible : Yes, John. So if you look at margin I'll start off with our core margin. Our core margin was 2.69, we're guiding that to be down mid-single digits. So I think we'll stay in the 2.60s. Given what we know, it's really a function -- this is like as hard as it's ever been in trying to forecast actually a margin number because of all this excess liquidity going on and what's happening with the loan portfolio and all that. That said, we expect to get more deposit growth as the stimulus plays out. That's going to continue to put pressure on core margin. No matter what we do with those funds right now until loan volume picks up, we're either going to put it at the fed or go to invest the dollars. So our margin -- core margin is coming down. We believe that we can probably stay in the 2.60s throughout most of this year hopefully. And if as loans pick up in the second half of the year, we might be in the higher range of 2.60s. But right now I would just say mid to lower 2.60s. And then if you just look at the GAAP, our reported margin we are running off the purchase accounting accretion. It's about three or four basis points a quarter, what it's been doing the last couple of quarters. That will continue. So we're at 3.01. And you adjust for core coming down and then you take three or four down that will come down probably end up in the 2.80s give or take by the end of the year depending on what happens with the accretion runoff. But that said and I think the important thing there is that we are focused on managing NII and we're guiding for at least flat if not better than flat NII as the year plays out. John Pancari : Got it. Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then separately on the loan growth front you mentioned a couple of times now the likely inflection in loan growth in the -- ideally in the back half of the year it seems like. Maybe if you can help us think about that the pace of growth that could materialize in the back half. And more importantly what type of loan growth is fair to assume as we look into going into 2022? Are we talking about the low single-digit pace as being reasonable? Bill Rogers : Yes. I think as Kelly noted earlier, I mean it's hard to project out. We had a lot of months here because there are a lot of binary events that are going on. But we just look at things like pipelines. We look at things like productions. We look at things like the impacts of those. So I do think if you look at overall and think about core and think about that base, I mean we're talking about single digit kind of growth through the latter part of the year. The things that could influence that more would be as I've mentioned earlier revolver utilization changes things like that. But I think if you look at, sort of, the core growth part I would think, sort of, averaging single-digits. And then, of course, for us you just have to remember, we have a little bit of that PPP headwind in the total loan growth. But we really think about sort of core second half of the year some type of single-digit opportunity. John Pancari : Got it. Thanks, Bill. That\u2019s helpful. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our final question from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Bill Carcache : Thanks. Good morning. Kelly and Bill, I wanted to follow-up on your ESG commentary in the release. How have your discussions evolved with different stakeholders? Are the investments you're making in ESG a source of differentiation? Or are they stable stakes? And how are you thinking about the financial impact of ESG? Kelly King : Yes. So, we feel very good about the long-term financial impacts of ESG. It's clearly the right thing to do for our communities for the economy at large. To be honest, it's bumpy right now for all of us to figure out what the near-term economic impacts are, because we're all fairly new at this. But there's no doubt that the long-term economic impacts will be very positive, not to mention the quality of life and the future for our kids and our grandkids. And so, we are really committed to a very aggressive and broad-based ESG program. You're just seeing a lot of things we're doing like our social bond. Daryl has done a lot of things already in terms of bringing our environment. We have lots more plans as we go down the road. So, it's something that we all in the corporate community need to be highly invested in and Truist is. I think it's net accretive long-term. In the short-term, it could be a little bumpy. Bill Rogers : Yes. I think as Kelly said, I mean we view it collectively as an opportunity versus a requirement. I think that's how we want to think about it. And I think our teammates have embraced that. And I think just -- they are things that will just make us a better company and a better society. Bill Carcache : That's helpful. Thank you. And if I may as a follow-up, a separate question for Daryl. Could you give some additional thoughts around the variability on either side of around the $2.1 billion and $1.8 billion of merger costs on slide 15? With seven quarters to go through 2022, how do you think about the potential for these to come in either better or worse? Any perspective there would be great. Daryl Bible : Bill, I would tell you we're on track of getting about $4 billion. Last year, we did about $1.3 billion. And if you add the two numbers together, this year we'll probably be $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion as well this year as the numbers come through, and then we'll finish out and get the rest in 2022. So, I think we're just on track right now. Our main focus, to be honest with you, is to really do a great job on the conversions to make sure everybody has a really positive client experience. I mean that would be the best outcome of all, and what the cost should -- that we have in there should be able to enable that to happen. Bill Carcache : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : That will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn it back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Alan Greer : Okay. Thank you all for joining our call. This does complete our earnings call. We apologize to those in the queue that we didn't have time to get to your questions. We will reach out to you later today. Thank you and we hope you have a great day. Operator : That concludes today's call. We appreciate your participation.",

The only authorized live and achieved webcast are located on our website. With that, I'll turn it over to Kelly. Kelly King : Thanks Ankur, and thanks to all of you for joining us. We really appreciate your support. So, it's a really strong quarter, which reflects our diverse business mix, our consistent risk management. We did have a negative provision, and importantly, I would point out investments that we have made in insurance, investment banking, wealth and digital capabilities, and excellent progress in our conversion. As you've heard us say before, we believe culture continues to be the primary driver of our success. I will point out today and these times, our purpose really resonates with teammates and others as our purpose of inspiring and building better lives and communities is motivational and satisfying to our teammates being involved in helping make the world a better place. We're now focused, you may be interested in knowing and helping each of our teammates align with our culture on a personal basis because we find that engagement really excels when people are aligned with the personal purpose and the cultural purpose. Our EO team is highly focused on cultural integration and activation and as a primary focus for all of us. If you're following the slides, if you look on Slide 5, just want to point out that for us, purpose is not just a banner, it's the way we live. It's truly trying to inspire and build better lives and communities. We focus a lot of attention, especially now and increasing on DEI. I would point out some of the major investments we're making in our communities. For example, this quarter, we contributed a combined $200 million of Truist Foundation and Truist Charitable Fund to support important work of our organizations across our diverse markets and communities. It's very excited that we were able to invest $22 million in Atlanta's Mercy Care, which is a fantastic federally qualified healthcare for homeless program. We expanded our partnership with Operation HOPE with a $20 million investment to help provide more education, insights, and tools to help more people build better lives. And we invest $2.5 million in a grant to the National Institute for Student Success to improve the financial education and graduation rates for underserved students. This is a fantastic program. But it's not just about philanthropy, it's about the way we live around here every day. So, I'm very proud that we released our inaugural Supplier Diversity Impact Report, which outlined a $1 billion total economic impact through supplier diversity relationships in 2020. We're at 114% prorated on our goal for our three-year $60 billion community benefit plan, which is really helping our communities. And through second quarter 2021, we've originated about $17 billion of PPP loans, which really have supported our business clients and employees and our communities. We're very active and increasing our engagement with regard to ESG. We're very focused on energy and sustainable-related financing. We're in the second quarter continuing from 2020, we've invested $2.4 billion in clean energy and sustainable-related financing. Look forward soon into next few weeks for the Second Truist CSR and ESG report, which I think you will enjoy. So now, if you flip with us to Slide 7, I just want to point out some of the key performance highlights. So, a very strong quarter. We had taxable equivalent revenue of $5.6 billion, which was up a strong 4% sequentially from first quarter. We had $5.6 billion in taxable equivalent revenue, we had the revenue and net income was $2.1 billion, which was at 30% linked. Very proud of our $1.55 diluted EPS which was up 31% sequentially and a strong 89% over last year. Our return on average tangible common equity adjusted was a very strong 24.7%. But even if you take out the reserve release, it's still a really, really strong 20.9%, which is driven by strong performance in insurance, investment banking, wealth, card and payment fees, and our commercial real estate-related income. We had strong performance in terms of revenue. As I said, it did drive a 2% increase in adjusted non-interest expenses due to incentives, but frankly, this is exactly the kind of expense increase we like to have. When you put that together, revenue and expenses, we had a solid adjusted operating leverage of 2% and our adjusted PP&R was $2.5 billion, up 6% compared to last quarter. Our asset quality is great. We performed well in CCAR, which allowed us to be in a position to propose a 7% increase in our dividend, a record $0.48 per quarter. Our merger integration is going very, very well and top performance and improved economic conditions give us confidence to reduce our CET1 target to 9.75% and Daryl will talk more about that. So, our total performance for the quarter, we think was very, very strong and very comprehensive, which we feel very, very good about. If you'll flip with us to Slide 8, I just want to point out a few of the selected items that impacted adjusted income. First, we had merger-related and restructuring charges of $297 million, $228 million after-tax, which was a diluted impact of $0.17. Incremental operating expenses related to the merger, I'll point out again, these are merger-related expenses but don't meet the technical definition of merger-related and restructuring charges, but they're not in our run rate going forward. That's $190 million, $146 million after-tax and $0.11 diluted negative impact. As I mentioned, we did have a $200 million contribution to our Truist Foundation and Truist Charitable Fund, which had an $0.11 impact. I would point out in the merger-related and restructuring charges, included in that is a $111 million after-tax accrual related to our voluntary separation and retirement program, which was a program that we offered in June. We had approximately 2,000 teammates that elected to participate. These were totally voluntary decisions on their part, and I want to really thank and appreciate those teammates for their commitment and support and help us build a foundation of Truist. This program does help us reduce costs and create capacity to invest in needed services for our clients. It's really part of our overall intense focus on reconceptualizing our businesses. To thrive in today's world requires a deep commitment to continuously reevaluating yesterday's activities and expenses associated with that, so that we can afford to invest in new activities for today's demands. With that, let me turn it to Bill to talk about some \u2013of our key trends. Bill Rogers : Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everybody. As you can see on Slide 9, we continue to experience robust demand for digital banking services as our clients look for more convenient and more effective ways to transact and manage their finances. The pace of digital adoption has been especially wrapped and mobile. Since the second quarter of 2020, our active user base has increased by 9% to over 4.1 million active clients. Yet the digital growth stories, it's a lot more than that, isn't just one dimensional. In addition to growing active users, we're deepening our relationships as we accompany clients along their digital journey. By providing the premier digital experience, we build trust with our clients. They then entrust us to facilitate a broader range of transactions. A great example of this is in mobile payments where Zelle transactions were up 60% compared to a year ago. We're also excited about the rollout of our new digital experience that's beginning now ahead of our physical conversion. After completing a successful internal pilot, we're beginning to migrate the Truist Digital offering to a small number of clients, rollout will happen in a series of waves throughout the back half of the year. We anticipate that up to 0.5 million clients could be on the digital platform by the end of this month, with more to be added in each successive wave. On the right, you can see just one example of how we're using digital and meet clients where they are in the small business space. A single sign on focus for clients with personal and business accounts has a significant benefit, allowing our small business clients to toggle back and forth seamlessly between their business and personal finances. Our clients also be able to customize their dashboard and notifications, so they can focus on what matters to them. In addition, our fraud detection technology will help small business clients with -- from fraudulent transactions or more secure banking experience. The attractiveness of our overall approach is that we've created a common platform for retail wealth and small business, which creates agility and seamless client experiences, but the experiences are tailored and designed for the unique needs of each client segment. Now, let me move to Slide 10. Loan growth remain challenging in the second quarter given strong liquidity levels in the marketplace and amongst our clients. Supply chain disruptions and low levels of rates which are driving high levels of refinance activity. Average loans decrease $6.1 billion compared to the first quarter, driven by $3.3 billion dollar in commercial loans and a $2.2 billion decline in residential mortgages. Average C&I balances decreased $2.4 billion, reflecting a $1.3 billion impact from PPP forgiveness and $1.2 billion from lower dealer floor plan outstandings. Nevertheless, we're encouraged about potential green shoots in C&I. Excluding the impacts of PPP and dealer floorplan, C&I loans grew modestly due to an increase in production and stable utilization late in the quarter. Several of our markets and specialties saw growth, particularly middle market. June production and corporate institutional group was the highest it's been since the merger and June production in the Commercial Community Bank was the highest it's been in 18 months. If you exclude April 2020, which was obviously unusual due to elevated line draws. Our revolver exposure continued to grow by month evidence of our relevance and that our clients are building capacity for investments or expansion. Average consumer loans decreased $2.7 billion as a result of ongoing refinance activity in our residential mortgage and home equity and direct portfolios. Residential mortgages held for investment decreased $2.2 billion as prepayment speeds remained elevated despite some moderation from first quarter levels. We're expanding our correspondent capacity and transferring some correspondent production to hold for investment to support future growth. We also believe prepayment speeds will continue to moderate. Indirect remains a bright spot due growth in our prime marine RV portfolios and Lightstream. Overall, loan growth remained elusive in the second quarter, both for the industry and for Truist. As indicated earlier, we're seeing evidence of things beginning to turn and our execution is improving at Truist with a keen focus on balance sheet diversity and prudent risk management. Long-term long growth as an output and highly correlated economic growth and we firmly believe the economy, particularly in our key markets, is on a very solid footing and on an expansion trajectory. Let me turn to Slide 11. Average deposits increased 3.4% compared to the first quarter, largely due to the continuing effects of recent government stimulus. We experienced strong deposit inflows while maximizing our value proposition to clients outside of rate paid as average total deposit costs decreased one basis point sequentially to four basis points. More importantly, Truist continues to resonate with clients. During the second quarter, we had a record personal checking account production and added more than 51,000 net new accounts which attests to the strength of our franchise. We're also doing an excellent job retaining clients as attrition rates from recently closed branches continue to be significantly more favorable than plant. We believe these favorable client dynamics reflect our robust markets, strong digital commerce, production, and solid execution by our teammates in the retail community bank. And with that Darryl, let me turn it over to you for our financial performance. Daryl Bible : Thank you and good morning everyone. Continuing on Slide 12, net interest income decreased $40 million, largely due to $32 million lower purchase accounting accretion. Net interest margin decreased 13 basis points are purchase counting accretion was four basis points headwind. Core net interest margin decreased nine basis points due to the continued build of excess liquidity, which was approximately $18 billion this quarter as well as the impact of persistent low rate environment. Asset sensitivity increased modestly due to the increase in DDA and the favorable deposit mix changes, partially offset by the increase in the investment portfolio. I would also know almost 60% of our assets sensitivity is from the short end of the curve, given a solid upside when short-term rates begin to rise. Our diverse business mix is a key strength and continues to provide revenue momentum and a low rate environment. Adjusted non-interest income grew 11% sequentially and 13% year over year, driven by record results in multiple feed businesses. Insurance income was a record $690 million driven by strong organic growth and new business, excellent retention rates, and a firm pricing market. Organic revenue grew 15% versus a COVID impacted light quarter. And we continue to forecast very healthy organic growth. Given the various uncertainties that exist in the marketplace, this is clearly a good time to be in a business that helps clients manage risk. Fee income from investment banking, reflected strong results, and syndicated finance and M&A, raw trading income was offset by $60 million swing and the CVA. We have been consistently investing in and building our corporate and investment banking business for over 15 years and this quarter's results are a reflection of that. Record CRE income was driven by strong structured real estate transaction activity. Our strong performance is also a testament to the CRA teams experience and deep client relationships. Other income benefited from valuation gains on our long standing partnerships related to our SBIC funds and also investments we've made through our Truist Ventures unit. When small businesses win, our communities win. So, we are thrilled with the success we have had over many years with our SBIC program. Continuing on Slide 14, interest expense increased $401 million from the prior quarter. Drivers included a $200 million charitable contribution to the Truist Foundation and Truist Charitable Fund to support our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities. In addition, merger-related restructuring charges an incremental operating expenses increased $171 million, largely due to the voluntary separation and retirement program that Kelly mentioned earlier. Adjusted non-interest expense increased 2.1% modestly due to higher variable compensation related to the stronger performance of our fee businesses and overall strong corporate performance. Adjusted non-interest expense was also favorable relative to adjusted revenue growth driving sequential positive operating leverage this quarter. Turning to Slide 15, asset quality remains excellent, reflecting our prudent risk culture and diverse portfolio as well as a stronger economy. Non-performing assets decreased two basis points. Net charge offs decreased 13 basis points to 20 basis points, a pro forma post financial crisis low. Lower charge offs reflect improvements in our indirect auto and C&I portfolios as well as an uptick in recoveries. Our ALLL remained strong at 1.79% with excellent coverage ratios. Due to the improved economic outlook, our provision was a negative $434 million and we released $560 million of reserves. Continuing on Slide 16. Capital remained strong. Our CET ratio increased to 10.2%. Our total payout ratio was 78% and included 610 million of share repurchases. We continue to optimize our capital stack by redeeming our Series H preferred stock. Our latest CCAR results reflect our prudent risk management and resiliency under stress. Truist had the second lowest loss rate in our peer group, as well as above average stress PP&R relative to peers. Our preliminary stress capital buffer was reduced to 2.5% from 2.7%. Our strong CCAR results, improving economy, and merger progress provide additional capital flexibility. Our Board will consider proposal to increase the dividend by 7% to $0.48 per share in its July meeting. We also intend to manage to approximately 9.75% CET1 ratio over the near-term, which would reflect approximately $4 billion to $5 billion of potential capital deployment, either through repurchases or acquisitions over the next five quarters. Turning to Slide 18, we are making steady progress in our integration plan, and our risk profile improves with each conversion. During the second quarter, we successfully converted our Wealth Truist platform. We are very proud of our wealth, digital, and technology teammates for their hard working completing this conversion and brokerage platform conversion in February. More impressively, our advisors continue to produce positive net organic asset flows, which combined with strong market conditions, produced excellent results in wealth management fee income. We also performed extensive testing to prepare for the upcoming core bank conversions. After each milestone, we reflect on what we've learned, apply those learnings to the future integration activities. This reduces the risk and helps us ensure we get better with each step of the integration. As we look to the third quarter, much of our focus will be on the final preparations for the conversion of our heritage BB&T clients to the Truist ecosystem later this year. This will be followed by heritage SunTrust conversion in the first quarter of 2022. Continuing on Slide 19, we are committed to achieving 1.6 billion of net cost saves and continue to make progress across those five categories. Third party spend is down 10.3% versus a baseline and now exceeds our revised target of 10%. And retail banking remain at 374 cumulative branch closures and are on track to achieve approximately 800 total closures by the first quarter of 2022 including 39 closures we are expecting in July. Non-branch facility space is down 3.8 million square feet and we were closing in on our target of 4.8 million. We appreciate all the hard work our teammates have done to keep us on track to achieve these goals. Average FTEs decreased 11% since the merger announcement would acquire even further given the WSRP program. Technology savings will materialize after redundant systems are decommissioned in 2022. We're also making critical investments in digital and technology. Since the merger closed, we have doubled our digital agile teams and tripled our total agile teams, which makes us nimbler and improves our speed-to-market enhancing our client experience. Turning to Slide 20. We still expect to incur a total merger cost of approximately $4 billion through 2022. We have incurred cumulative merger costs of $2.7 billion through the second quarter, reflecting considerable integration work on Slide 18. Looking ahead, we expect these cost to decrease significantly after our first quarter core bank conversion and then drop off entirely after 2022. Continuing on Slide 21, our core non-interest expense was $2.952 billion in the second quarter. This calculation removes the effects from asset value changes for our retirement plans, our insurance acquisitions, and higher variable compensation through the fee income and corporate performance. This makes it much more comparable to the baseline expenses at the time the merger closed. Based on the trajectory of our ongoing cost save initiatives. We are on track to achieve our fourth quarter core expense target of $2.94 billion. We are fully committed to this target and we are confident in our ability to meet it. Now, I provide guidance for the third quarter. We expect total net interest income to be relatively stable versus linked quarter as one additional day combined with moderate loan growth, excluding PPP, offsets declines in purchase accounting, accretion and PPP revenue. Core net interest margin is expected to be relatively stable, however, reported net interest margin will continue to decline as a result of diminishing purchase accounting accretion. These should remain healthy, given investments we've made in our businesses, robust market conditions, and continued economic recovery. They will not be as strong as second quarter performance. This is partially due to insurance seasonality, but we would expect solid growth compared to third quarter of last year. Adjusted expenses should be relatively flat linked quarter, but will decline fourth quarter as lower personnel costs are realized from the VSRP program. We expect the net charge-off ratio to be 25 basis points to 35 basis points given the continued strengthening of the economy. Also if the strong credit quality performance continues, we would expect further reductions in our loan loss allowance ratio. Overall, we had excellent operating quarter as strong fee income more than offset modest lower spread income and outpaced expenses to drive 2% sequential operating leverage. Now, let me hand it over to Kelly to discuss our value proposition. Kelly King : Just want to make a couple of comments with regard to our value proposition this quarter focusing on our markets and capital. We are really very, very pleased that 70% of our net new accounts are opened by new households. We think this shows market share gains in migration in our markets and our digital advantage as about half of our new accounts are opened online. All of this, interestingly is happening in the face of large number of branch closures that Daryl described where client retention is a very strong 98% plus, which is really fantastic in any type of merger. As mentioned, our CCAR performance lowered risk in the economy, reduced risk in our conversion process, which Daryl discussed gives us great confidence to propose a meaningful increase in our dividend to a record $0.48 and reduce our target CET1 to 9.75%. Just wanted to emphasize that again to make sure you get that, because that's important. We also are very confident in achieving, as Daryl said, our $1.6 billion net cost saves based on a number of initiatives that are driving the reconceptualization of our business; our expense reductions and our industry-leading profitability. We believe that the combination of that will support our investments in future strategies and leading technology investments. Then finally, if you'll just flip to Slide 23, just wanted to make a couple of points that how the metrics and numbers support that value proposition. As we've said before, we have a really exceptional franchise; we have the highest projected population growth compared to our peers in our marketplaces; we have really good fee income diversity with our investments in insurance, investment banking, and wealth; we are really uniquely positioned from a profitability perspective with our adjusted diluted EPS at $1.55, up 89% adjusted return on average tangible common equity at a strong 24.7% and we have strong capital, as Daryl described as well. So, if you look at the quarter overall, it was a strong quarter based on our strong culture, great markets, awesome team. There are plenty of challenges out there, the pandemic is getting better, the economy is getting better and overall at Truist, we fully believe our best days are ahead. Ankur, we'll turn it back to you. Ankur Vyas : Thank you, Kelly. Before we move to Q&A though, I'd like to quickly turn it to Bill who'd like to share a few concluding thoughts. Bill Rogers : Might make you feel a little uncomfortable, but so bear with me. So, given this is Kelly's last and 50th earnings call as CEO, I just want to spend a few minutes highlighting his legacy, just incredible positive impact on BB&T, Truist, the banking industry, and our communities during his 49-year career in banking. I could take hours to do this, but I won't given that we only have a few minutes, but I thought this group of analysts and investors would appreciate who followed his career. Kelly joined BB&T in 1972 and I thought it was great irony that earlier this week he spoke to our leadership development program, individuals, and teammates who joined just the same way you did, Kelly. When he speaks about the benefits of a growth mindset, positive thinking, choosing to be happy, and seeing opportunities and change just like he just did, he speaks from his personal experience and his heart. Kelly's humble roots give him a genuine appreciation for all people. They've driven his Seeds of Hope initiative and played a key role in our value of caring which says everyone and every moment matters. He's also the driving force with our happiness value. Positive energy changes lives and he exhibits that daily for our teammates and for our clients. Kelly became CEO in 2009 in the depths of the global financial crisis. BB&T was one of the few banks to remain profitable through every quarter through that crisis. When he began at BB&T, it was a small bank in Eastern North Carolina with about $250 million in assets. When he became CEO, the bank had a $152 billion assets, and today, Truist has $520 billion in assets. Market cap is 4 times during his tenure. Always a forward thinker, Kelly is a purpose driven leader who steered BB&T through tremendous change, not just to survive, but to thrive through the Great Recession, multiple economic downturns, and now, through a global pandemic and our merger of equals. In addition to traversing tumultuous business headwinds, I admire he's never lost sight of his personal purpose, which is to make a positive meaningful difference in the lives of as many people as possible. His empathy, compassion, and leadership had tremendous impact on just to name in fairness a few financial education for more than 1 million high school students through the Truist Financial Foundations; childhood literacy, which is a passion of his through a new reading app called WORD Force, which is just getting started; community service through the Lighthouse Project, positively impacting the lives of more than 20 million people since its inception in 2009. Kelly has always had an interest in and a commitment to leadership development. It's the foundation for the Truist Leadership Institute in Greensboro, many of you've been there. It has been renamed the Kelly S. King Center in his honor. It not only trains executives to become better and more self-aware leaders, but it also offers customized training at no cost for principals and has certified many, many students at no cost through our Emerging Leaders curriculum, which is provided in partnership with over 80 colleges and universities. Kelly is known for saying there's no facet of society that cannot be improved through better leadership. Before our merger, I knew Kelly well. I also listened to these calls Kelly, many of your 50 calls. We joined forces with a concept that we can truly build a purposeful company that stood for something better and outperformed with consistency over the long-term. Kelly, you were the perfect leader to start us on that journey. Your inspirational leadership was a positive catalyst for all of us. So, with a heartfelt thank you for your leadership, your contributions to Truist, to our industry, and personally for our friendship. I look forward to our continued partnership and collaboration with you going forward as you transition to the role of Executive Chair for our Board of Directors. So, now we can turn it over to Q&A. Kelly, thank you. Kelly King : Can I make just one quick comment? Bill Rogers : You're still in charge. Kelly King : I do just want to note that this is also Daryl's 50th conference call. So, congratulations to Daryl, but thank you, Bill, for that. I just wanted to say to our audience that has supported us over all these years, it has been honor and a blessing to have worked with thousands of Truist teammates over all these years to serve our communities and I really, really cherish that opportunity. I'll also just say to all of us that banking is an honorable profession, which serves to help build better lives and communities every single day. I am humbled and proud to have been a part of it. Thank you for your support. We appreciate it and as I've said many times, I truly believe our best days are ahead. Ankur Vyas : Thank you, Kelly. Thank you, Bill. Shannon, at this time, we're now ready to start Q&A. So, if you'll explain to our listeners how they can participate in the Q&A session. I'd like to ask the participants to limit yourselves to one primary and one follow-up so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Kelly. Good morning, Bill. Kelly King : Hey, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : To start off, on behalf of many on this call, Kelly, I would also reiterate Bill's fabulous comments about your career, and congratulate you on being an outstanding community, spiritual, and commercial bank leader. I think you will be missed by many. So congratulations. On questions, maybe starting with you, Bill, can you give us some further color or elaborate on the green shoots that you guys are seeing in the loan growth area for possibly the second half of the year, Daryl touched on in as well. And where you're seeing some of this potential growth coming from? Bill Rogers : Yes. Sure, Gerard. As I've mentioned, production in June in CIG and CCB was sort of hitting some high points. So, we started to see a little bit an inflection point. In CIG, a lot of that came from industrials, healthcare, tech, that probably doesn't surprise you, I mean, I think as we think about that, infrastructure that's ahead of us. I think energy is a potential for the future. I'll put that a little bit of the question mark, it's probably the light green of a green chute. And CCB, really good progress in our middle market, a lot in our verticals. Senior care, I think, that's really coming back strong. Our dealer network, so we've -- despite the outstandings, our exposure dealer is going up and then just sort of our government services. Again, I don't think those are surprises. Those are pretty core parts of our economy. Overall, revolver commitments were up. So, as I said earlier, I think the capacity of our clients to invest. The -- when this will come? I think that's sort of the question. I don't think -- I think it's -- I don't think it's an \u2013 if I feel like we're in a good position, whether that manifests itself so much in the second quarter. Remember, we still have some headwinds with PPP. But our tailwinds, I think the dealer part will rebound. I mean, you'll see the supply chain start to normalize whether that happens at the end of this year or first next year, I don't know, but that will rebound. The economy, particularly in our markets utilization, and just as Kelly mentioned, our just core executions just gets better every day. So, I think those are tailwinds. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Kelly King : Hey, Gerard, I would like to add. Bill and I and others have been on regional visits virtually so far this this year, and we've talked, I guess, build a hundreds of offshore business clients and feedback. And I think it's a really big deal. Universally has been extremely confident and positive. They're all talking about projects that they're working on. It is -- as Bill just dropping in and show up and reshoot, I personally think it will really begin to show up as we head in third and fourth quarter and certainly undergo a strong 2022, but the confidence level is very, very high. Chris Henson : Gerard, this is Chris. I might just add that we had 16 of our 22 regions that were actually positive in C&I growth, less dealer this quarter. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And maybe shifting over to Daryl, you talked a little bit, Daryl, about the possibility of bringing the loan loss reserves down. You mentioned that in the DFAST tests, you're the second best in terms of on the credit losses. I see if I recall, your day one reserves back in January of 2020 were 1.61%. Can you give us maybe some color and maybe Clarke as well about the outlook that could that reserve level fall below the day one now that the outlook might be even stronger today than it was in January of 2020, excluding the pandemic situation? Daryl Bible : Yes, thanks for the question, Gerard. What I would tell you is that when we established our CECL day one number, we waited our pessimistic scenario of 40%. If you look at the economy now and the growth that we're seeing and outlook, our waiting is much less than that. So, as the economy plays out throughout this year, there is a chance that we could pierce through and maybe go over or go under our CECL day one number that we started with in January of 2020 from that perspective. I think you have to take a quarter-by-quarter and see how it's performing. But right now, the economy seems to be going on really strong and gaining momentum. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Hi. You don't have revenue synergies built in your final numbers, but it seems like you might have some revenue synergies here. So, specifically, I'm asking off the record in insurance and off the record in investment banking, how much of those revenues are driven by cross-selling versus just the core organic growth? And I have my insurance analyst colleague at Wells Fargo Securities to ask on that second part, Elyse? Elyse Greenspan : Yes. Thanks. Go ahead. Kelly King : Go ahead. Elyse Greenspan : I was just going to build upon my question on the insurance, I'm just hoping that you guys had an impressive organic growth quarter, hoping to get an update on your outlook for the rest of the year, how things can trend versus the 15% this quarter? And how the different roles within retail and wholesale segments of the business? Chris Henson : Right, I'd be happy to that. Maybe Bill and I will take the ERM question first and then I'll jump back and answer your question, Elyse. From ERM perspective, I will tell you it is going really well, where we have been, for the past 18 months, in the behavior building kind of phase. And when I look at this quarter, I see very strong contributions from the Commercial Community Bank to our strategic side, which is a CIG for capital market services. I see a very strong up 20% in a growth perspective, I see mortgage up in the mid-30s. And CIG, which is back to insurance and to a few other areas, up well over 100% in terms of growth. In fairness, we have some other areas that have some opportunity, but I would -- I like what I see and I think what we're building really is the right foundation for behavioral jumping off point across the company. It is something that Bill and I have been partially monitoring and working with each one of the business lines and we're in kind of still of a build-out process from the term -- from terms of understanding sort of what's possible and we're really trying to push a lot of business leaders to think bigger, because we think the opportunity is a very substantial. Bill, anything you want to add to that? Bill Rogers : Yes, I think Chris had it exactly right. And remember, Mike, I mean, these cut across a lot of different parts and we like to think about the term of integrated relationship management. So that it cuts across clients and we're meeting clients\u2019 needs and working backwards. But just to like, give an example, sort of in a Commercial Community Bank, we doubled the number of transactions that we did in the quarter versus last quarter. And these might be where we were left lead, this might be where we were in M&A transaction. And the pipeline has also doubled where it was before. So, as a percent of the growth -- as a percent of the total, it's a smaller percent; as a percent of the incremental growth, it's a larger percent. And I think that's going to continue to grow the momentum, the cultural alignment, the -- all the parts that we've built as part of One Truist, I just feel -- I feel great about it, and that I think that momentum will continue. And you'll see it in just -- the way I think you'll see it as versus revenue synergies, specifically, what you'll see it as an incremental growth relative to others. Chris Henson : And so coming back, Elyse, to your question, and I just preface this with comments that we took sort of a white sheet of paper to this business back in early 2018, brought in a consultant and really begin to break the business down and look at all the opportunities to put the pieces back together. I think what you're seeing here is a three-year -- end of a three-year period of where we have really taken a lot of steps to build back a business in the most effective way possible in a really good operating environment. So, I would have to say this is fundamentally the best quarter I have seen in this business in my career and I've been working on this business a long time. And we are, by the way, cranking off as we conclude the first three-year period, we're kicking off another three-year period, because we think there's more that we can do and will do to improve this business. But to get to your question, what's really driving organic growth is pricing in the industry I think probably peaked in the fourth or first quarter of fourth quarter, 2020 or first quarter this year, it was sort of in the up 7% range where we're now if you read all the industry information kind of in up, call it 6% kind of range. But we really believe while rates have moderated a little, we believe that it's still going to be very positive throughout the balance of 2021. You might have potential for a little slight moderation, but we still think it's very strong in the up category in the mid 5% to 6% kind of category. And we just entered hurricane season, by the way; in the fall was wildfire season. So, you never know, it could just hold or even increase from there depending on what happens. Our client retention in retail is at 91.8% and that's up a 1% over the last year. And in a hard market environment that favors wholesale more, that is a -- that is very much a positive. Our wholesale business is 86.1%, it's up 2%, also very strong. But we are continuing to see risk shift from the standard market that supports retail to wholesale. Probably the most notable driver of organic growth was just our new business production and that is driven just by core GDP growth. And so we're in the up portion of the V right now from an economic perspective. And so 24.5% business -- new business growth is double, the best I've seen historically, year-to-date, we're up 19%. So, we get organic growth rate -- total growth rate of 18.8%, but when you strip out acquisitions organic of 14.8%. We are including in this quarter $29 million of revenue from prior acquisitions, that does not include Constellation, which we just closed on July 1, but includes if you looked at annual run rates, it's about $130 million or prior acquisitions we did, Truist a number of seven or eight to the back half of last year and the first part of this year. So, that's sort of the organic growth question. But to get to your outlook question, just remember we're going from our seasonally strongest quarter of the year to our seasonally weakest quarter from second to third. So, we expect commissions to be down about 8% going from second to third. And there's still certainly uncertainties, but we just think the environment looking forward is still very favorable. When you think of improving economy with the GDP and improving employment, which really drives our AB business, increasing pricing, as we just said and sort of 6% range. And then we benefit from the shift to the E&S market via our very strong wholesale business because while we operate a diversified model, quite frankly. We think pricing is going to continue to be strong. You're seeing sort of the drivers in the industry this quarter. Umbrella in excess is up 11.6%, D&O is up 11%, commercial property, which we have a disproportionate exposure to is up 9.6%, that's really good for us. So, we expect for the third quarter high single-digit organic growth in our weakest quarter, that would be the highest growth that I've seen historically, period. But we're seeing -- we're expecting high single-digit growth in our weakest quarter, which I think is fantastic for the business. And just remember, we did close Constellation on July 1st and that adds %160 million in revenue and really helps us form one of the largest programs divisions in wholesale units of any wholesale provider going forward. Mike Mayo : Great. Well, thank you very much. Operator : And our next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hey, good morning. Kelly King : Hey. Betsy Graseck : Hi Chris. Just a quick follow up on that $160 million is additive so your 8% Q-o-Q is not including that acquisition, just want to just want to clarify that. Chris Henson : No, it is in our forecast. So, what you're typically saying I mean, last year, you'd have seen second or third, we would drop maybe $75 million this year, you would have seen a $90 million drop, but with the addition of this number, you'd see something like $50 million because you've got $160 million annually. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay. And then just the expenses associated with Constellation that we should be thinking about anything there to -- no doubt? Chris Henson : Now, there's expense synergies, so this business actually the margin is accretive for overall margin. So, I think there are expenses, but they're synergies that are coming out. Betsy Graseck : Okay, great. Daryl Bible : I think the operating ratio initially is like 70% for Constellation, if you want to add any expenses, but the transaction. Chris Henson : Yes, and generally Betsy -- generally, it's about a 12-month integration. Betsy Graseck : Yes. No, you've done a great job at improving the operating efficiency of that business over the past several years. So, congratulations to you on that. I did have a couple other questions. First off, imitation is often the best form of flattery and there's a plenty of people imitating you on your specialty finance lending focus that has been a hallmark of TFC for many decades. Could you give us a sense as to how you're thinking about that business and where you want to be leaning into growth? Chris Henson : Absolutely, Betsy. Thank you for saying that. That is a -- that has been a focus of ours through our -- we really think of it in terms of point of sale. And when we talk about insurance and wealth and CIG, we probably should add sort of a point of sale focus through our core, Sheffield and you also have Live Stream, now we have a group of partnerships that are a little bit more indirect. Buying patterns have clearly changed by consumers. I no longer come to their bank to purchase their items I bought on the spot, and they want it just that way, and now they want it digitally just that way as well. So, we're working on all the above. And I think we have opportunities within our current business to expand verticals like hearing aids and do more in the way of trailers and that kind of thing. So, there are opportunities there, but I think we're also looking at other opportunities to expand like -- in the home improvement space would be a good place, there's a lot going on there. So, it's an area we're really focused on and something that we're really excited about. And it's an industry that has north of 20% kind of growth rates. So, we're very excited about the opportunity. Betsy Graseck : Okay, thanks. And then Daryl, just a couple for you one ticky-tacky one is just on the fees, you mentioned, down sequentially. We talked about the insurance seasonality, but up year-on-year, could you just remind us what kind of base level fees you're looking at year-on-year with other some one-timers in it last year, I just want to make sure I'm on the right base? Daryl Bible : If you look at it versus prior year, we'll probably be up anywhere from 5% to 10% range in that neighborhood. We did have some other income in there from our venture capital portfolios there, but be honest with you, we continue to invest in that. And that continues to be part of run right as we move forward. So, it's going to be lumpy back and forth, but it is going to be continuing to grow over time from that. Betsy Graseck : Okay. All right, that's helpful. And then just on the NCO ratio guide of the 25% to 35%, I think it came in this quarter around 20% or so and credit looks great. So, is this you being conservative with the 25%, 35%? Or is there something in the book that you would suggest you're expecting a little bit of a deterioration Q-o-Q on the ratio? Clarke Starnes : Betsy, this is Clarke. It's primarily seasonality. In second half of the year, we always have some seasonality uptick in some of the consumer portfolio. So, we're assuming we'll have some of that normal trend. And I would just also say this was an outstanding quarter, we did have all-time lows and things like our auto business, we had really low C&I, and higher recovery. So, we had some really strong tailwind this quarter. But all that being said, we still feel like we're going to have very strong loss performance as we move forward, given what we see today. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay. Thanks so much. And Kelly, it's been phenomenal working with you over the past several decades. So, very much appreciate the time that you spend with us and Bill, looking forward to working with you more closely going forward. Thanks. Kelly King : Thank you, Betsy and appreciate it. Operator : And our next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. I just want to circle back on the expense target for 4Q, the 2.94%. I guess, first clarification, does that include the impact of the insurance deals or I would assume we got to top it up for the one that just closed and maybe the others too? Daryl Bible : Yes, Matt. In our deck, we have that waterfall slide where we actually take our adjusted numbers and we back out three things, our non-qualified numbers we back that out. We back out insurance acquisitions and run rate because we're trying to compare back to what we looked like in 2019. And then with a huge growth that we've seen in our CIG area and our wealth area and our insurance area, just organic growth, that's great to have those revenues. But those revenues do have expenses, but those are good expenses. We're adjusting for those as well. So, that's what we're adjusting to, to try to get back to what we look like when we put the merger together in 2019. Matt O'Connor: Yes, that's Slide 21, or Page 21, that\u2019s very helpful. But when we see the 4Q 2021 adjustment expenses, will it be the 2.94% or we have to add that $20 million for insurance plus the one that you just did? Daryl Bible : Yes, it's going to be the number, the 2.94% will be the number on the right at the end of the waterfall. That's a core expense, it's not a run rate number. A run rate number is the adjusted number, which basically backs out your merger and restructuring charges, and your incremental MOE. That will tend to basically come down dramatically after the first quarter of next year when we finish our core bank conversions and go away totally by the end of 2022. Matt O'Connor: Okay, sorry -- so just to clarify that like, when we see the 4Q cost base, we'll take out their merger charges, we'll take out the incremental costs and should we still focus -- will we see the core number or the adjusted number? Daryl Bible : The adjusted number is the run rate number on a go-forward basis. All core does is basically try to back out because we're a dynamic company that's constantly changing and growing and doing things, we have to back out our expense bases that basically have benefited over the last two years of coming together. So, we're trying to show you that we're getting the 1.6% off of that original expense base by not penalizing us for the additional fee revenue growth that we received over the last couple years and acquisitions that we've done. Matt O'Connor: Okay, that makes sense. Sorry, to make you go through all that. And then as we kind of think through next year, do we take that the 4Q level, annualize it and obviously, you got some more cost saves coming, maybe a little seasonality in 1Q, but can you run rate that for key level and then be lower than that for next year full year, Daryl Bible : -- get into $1.6 billion cost saves. So, we'll get that by the end of 2022. We have a lot of things going on in the company right now, besides those five bucket of savings, which we're making tremendous progress in. Kelly talked about the voluntary separation and retirement program that we announced that basically, we have some teammates that volunteer to go away, basically the first wave of that will happen on 9/30, so you'll see the impact of that in the fourth quarter. That will continue to come down over the next couple quarters. The waves probably -- three or four waves overall to get everybody that volunteer to go -- to exit the company. And then Kelly and Bill talked about basically going through all of our processes and adjustments that we're making to have come together and get more efficiencies and scale. When we came together in 2019, we knew what we knew then, we know a lot more now and we're continuing to make our company much more efficient and improved. And we'll have savings from that all through 2022. But to be honest with you, we're creating fuel that basically will not only fall to the bottom-line, but we're also continuing to make a lot more investments in our businesses, in wealth, insurance, CIG, and other areas and we're also investing in technology and digital with this savings that we're getting. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll now hear from John McDonald of Autonomous Research. John McDonald : Yes, hi, I wanted to follow-up on the new capital target, Daryl said creates $4 billion or $5 billion of incremental excess capital. I just was wondering Bill, Kelly, how you're thinking about that, between M&A opportunities and share repurchases, any thoughts you could share on that? Kelly King : So, John, our waterfall of priorities has not changed in all these years. And it's what we would think good stable long-term investors would appreciate. The number one is always organic growth is highest payback for your shareholders. The second is a good stable long-term increasing dividend payout. Third is M&A and we have good opportunities there and that's been very, very encouraging. And fourth is buyback and we will do that aggressively when it's appropriate. John McDonald : Okay. Bill Rogers : John, just to emphasize that, and Kelly said it, I mean, -- and you see in our results, I mean our organic opportunities are significant. So what we see with our markets where we see our ability to invest and -- so that's going to be priority one, and it continues to enhance. John McDonald : Okay, and then just to follow-up on that, is it a target, we should think about kind of for the next year or so? Is that how you're thinking about, like kind of maybe moving down over the next year to that 9.75%? Bill Rogers : Yes, I think John, what we've said consistently is as the risk of the merger comes down and our confidence in the economy goes up, we'll evaluate that target. So, I think we're going to be on that trajectory. And I mean, it would be logical that our confidence is going to improve on the merger and improves every day. Daryl outlined a pretty good chart of the things that we've been doing. And then we'll all look and see how the economy is doing. So, we don't we don't want ever timebound that decision. It's really timebound by what's happening in our company and what's happening in the general economy. John McDonald : Okay, fair enough. Thanks. Ankur Vyas : And I think we've got time for one more question. Operator : Certainly, our next question will come --. Thank you. Our final question will come from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Morning. Just on that -- on the M&A front, I know, just indicated that there are -- you see some good opportunities there. Could you just give us your updated thoughts on that front? What type of M&A are you most interested in? And then separately, I'm curious to get your thoughts on President Biden's Executive Order, which seems to be implying greater scrutiny around larger bank deals. Want to see if that makes you think any differently about future deals? Thanks. Bill Rogers : Yes, John, on the M&A side, I think we'll be consistent with the things that we've seen. I mean, obviously, in the insurance side, we've had really good experience there and I would expect that to continue. We talked in Betsy's question about some of the enterprise payments, some of the opportunities we have there, some of the point of sale, I mean things that have been important to us strategically digital, perhaps, but things have been important to us strategically, we'll be consistent. I mean it would be -- we won't go sort of off-track from our from our core consistency. And as it relates to President Biden's thing, the -- as it relates to our business, I mean, let's -- maybe take a large bank M&A off the table, we've already done one of those. So, we feel we feel really good about that. But as it relates to our business, I mean, this really plays well with our sort of core middle market business. I mean, if you think about the place where we offer advice and where we see activity in the future, we think we're actually really, really well-positioned. John Pancari : Great, that's helpful Bill. And then separately just on your systems conversion, could you just give us a status update on where you stand on your core deposit conversion system? Just I want to confirm, are you definitely moving to a new system and not a legacy system when it comes to the core deposit banking system? And then where are you on that progress in that actual -- that part of the tech migration? Thanks. Bill Rogers : Yes, Daryl outlined in that one chart sort of all the different components that we're doing. As relates to the core conversion, we outline in there on the fall we'll convert the Heritage BB&T clients. In the first quarter, we'll convert the core STI clients. And that's on a much more agile platform that exists today. So, we're going to have a lot more flexibility in the things that we can do and the movements we can make and the assimilation of acquisitions, the ability to leverage APIs and do more things with that platform, and we are absolutely on track and as you can imagine we're monitoring this on a daily, hourly type basis. We're in just about in the dress rehearsal part for the fall. We're well into the UAT and SIT testing and feel good about where we are. John Pancari : Great. Thanks Bill. And Kelly, I wish you all the best. It's been a great ride and you should be proud. Kelly King : Thank you, John. Appreciate it very much. Thanks for your support. Ankur Vyas : All right, Shannon. Operator : And that does conclude our conference for today. Ankur Vyas : That concludes our call. Thank you, Shannon. Thanks everybody for joining. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team. Thank you for your interest in Truist. We hope you have a great day. Shannon, you can now disconnect the call. Operator : Thank you. Once again ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you all for your participation.",

Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Ankur Vyas, Truist Financial Corporation. Please go ahead, sir. Ankur Vyas : Thank you, Allen (ph). Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist third quarter 2021 earnings call. With us today are our CEO, Bill Rogers; and our CFO, Daryl Bible. During this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's third-quarter results, and also share perspectives and how we continue to activate Truist purpose, our progress on the merger, and current business conditions. Clarke Starnes, our Chief Risk Officer, Beau Cummins, our Vice-Chair, and John Howard, our Chief Insurance Officer, are also in attendance and are available to participate in the Q&A portion of our call. The acCompanying presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information, are available on the Truist Investor Relations website, ir. truist.com. Our presentation today will include Forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on slide 2 and 3 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures, as well as the appendix, for appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. In addition, Truist is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized live and archived webcast are on our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Bill. Bill Rogers : Thanks, Ankur. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. I hope everyone's well and safe. I'm very pleased by Truist continued progress on our solid third-quarter performance. Our quarterly results reflect the diversity of our business mix, which drove strong fee income and helped overcome continued softness in net interest income. Credit quality was outstanding, resulting another provision benefit. Loan growth was modest, excluding PPP, generally in line with our expectations. We also achieved a major integration milestone this past weekend, and we'll share more details on these topics during the presentation. If I move you to slide 4, I'd like to begin with our purpose, which is to inspire and build better lives and communities. We believe our purpose-driven culture is the primary factor behind our success as a Company. Our purpose defines how we do business every day and it serves as a framework for how we make decisions. A recent example of this was our decision to remain open during our conversion last Saturday, so we could care for our clients and address any questions. To my knowledge, that's the first for a major systems conversions such as ours. I've said in our culture, purpose, performance, teamwork, and a client-first mindset, all coexist, and there's no better evidence of that than the extraordinary success our teammates delivered this past weekend in our most significant merger milestone to-date, details of which I'll cover shortly. Slide 5 describes how we're living out our purpose and highlights some of the notable progress we've made during the quarter. During the pandemic, philanthropic giving was a natural way to put our purpose into action due to the effects of the coronavirus on our clients, teammates, and communities. Our purpose is much broader than philanthropy. We developed this slide around major themes contained in our CSR and ESG report because they're the topics that are most important to all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders. I won't cover every point on the slide. Let me just highlight a few. We continue to make strong progress against our $60 billion community benefits plan, currently a 112% of target, including the ongoing impact that Truist Community Capital provides our communities with regards to affordable housing, access to healthy food and education, and investments and job creation in small business. Truist and [Indiscernible] announced that all elementary school students nationwide will soon have access to workforce universe, a digital early literacy program. I'll talk more about this shortly, but we've migrated 7 million clients to the new Truist digital banking experience, which includes enhanced digital investment, money management capabilities, personalized insights, and a holistic personal financial management tool. We committed to increase diversity in our senior leadership roles to at least 15% by 2023. We're currently at almost 14%, and clearly on track. Importantly, long-term, the way we create a more diverse senior leadership organization is by recruiting diverse early talent and then developing, retaining, and promoting over time. And for early career program hiring in 2021, 64% of the seats at Truist were filled by diverse candidates. All of this progress combined with enhanced disclosures has resulted in solid improvements in our ESG scores. Lastly, in a few weeks we'll release our inaugural Truist TCFD report. Our teammates and I are very proud of Truist and all the ways we deliver on our purpose. So turning to the third quarter performance highlights on Slide 7, we earned $1.6 billion or $1.20 earnings-per-share for the quarter on a reported basis. On an adjusted basis, we earned 1.9 billion or $1.42 -- $1.42 per share. Adjusted EPS increased 46% versus the same quarter last year, and is largely driven by the provision benefit. Sequentially, EPS declined 8% as we had a greater benefit from the provision last quarter and seasonally stronger revenues last quarter. We had strong returns, including a 22.6 adjusted ROTCE. Excluding the reserve release, adjusted ROTCE was still very good, north of 19%. Revenues totaled $5.6 billion, fairly stable compared to last quarter. On an adjusted basis, year-over-year revenue growth was 2% as much stronger fee income offsets in almost 30 basis point decline in margin, and 8% decline in loans, a reflection of this unique environment that we're all in. The stronger adjusted fee income which grew 12% compared to a year ago, did drive slightly higher expenses than expected, but our PPNR is broadly in line with our expectations. Asset quality continues to be an excellent story, as we outperformed our net charge-off guidance with lower charge-offs across C&I combined with strong recoveries. During the quarter, we were pleased to increase the dividend 7%, and we completed the Constellation acquisition, which had a very good first quarter with Truist Insurance. Also, we announced the strategic acquisition of Service Finance, which will close later this year. Daryl will share some additional information on service finance, but it's broadly a reflection of Truist skating to where the puck is going, and partnering with a leader in home improvement point-of-sale lending. We also completed our retail mortgage origination conversions and benefits, which Daryl will also highlight later. Last but certainly not least, I'm very excited to report, this past weekend, we completed a major phase of our Core Bank conversion. After a lot of intense, deliberate, thoughtful, and purposeful preparation by our team, we were able to stand up the Truist technology ecosystem and migrate all heritage BB&T Retail Wealth and Business clients to it. Event went extremely well and there are number of notable positive impacts for clients and teammates. Starting this past Tuesday, over 2500 heritage BB&T &T teammates were able to log onto the new Truist commercial lending ecosystem for the first time. Because of the conversion, the Salesforce client management and sales pipeline system is now directly connected to the Encino lending origination system, which allows for better communication and workflow across the deal team, and visibility or progress of the loan all in one place. These upgrades also lay the foundation for future digital innovation. We're now able to offer Truist products to new clients and to heritage BB&T clients through our branches and digitally through t ruist.com, including our new Truist Ready Now Loan, a small dollar lending solution for existing clients to cover emergency financing needs between $100 and $1000, consistent with our belief on the importance of emergency savings. We upgraded our ATM, contact center, and digital payment capabilities across a number of dimensions, including more client self service, improved authentication, and operational simplification. While this was not a physical branding event, the conversion places us on excellent footing for the final conversion in the first quarter of 2022 when heritage SunTrust clients will transition to the Truist ecosystem and all branches will become Truist. Again, I want to congratulate our teammates on a job well done. They've prepared with intensity and purpose for multiple quarters. They learned and applied lessons from previous conversion work. They worked non-stop this past weekend, and delivered a seamless conversion. I really could not be more proud. Now, going to Slide 8. We have 3 significant items that negatively affected earnings during the quarter. First, merger charges totaled 132 million after-tax, lower than last quarter, because higher Voluntary Separation and Retirement Program costs were reflected in the second quarter. This VSRP program is one of the many components of our overall cost-saving goal. Approximately, half of our 2,000 teammates who elected to participate left on September 30th, and I cannot thank them enough for their long-standing efforts to build the foundation of Truist by helping create 2 amazing companies in BB&T and SunTrust, and then helping bring Truist to life during our almost first 2 years of existence. Incremental operating expenses related to the merger were 147 million after-tax. As a reminder, these are merger-related expenses but don't meet the technical definition of a merger-related and obstruction charges, will not be part of our run rate in 2023 and beyond. Also, we had a one-time professional fee accrual that met our disclosure and adjustment threshold, totaling 23 million after-tax. This fee was incurred to develop an ongoing program to identify, prioritize, and road map [Indiscernible] generated revenue growth and expense saving opportunities as part of the merger and beyond. This helps ensure that we'll achieve our 2022 cost save targets. It's also fuel for creating more capacity for investments in the future, will also improve the client experience, simplify our processes, and create a more engaged and energized workforce. Our teammates generated more than 50,000 -- 5,000 initial ideas, which we consolidated and narrowed down to approximately 1,000, and we're building the execution plan. Ultimately, our goal is for this to be an ongoing way of how we do business at Truist, and powering our teammates to identify and execute on ideas to improve our Company. The total impact on these 3 items was $0.22 per share. Moving to slide 9, as we've noted, Truist is the first large merger in the digital age, so we're highly focused on ensuring a smooth transition for our digitally active clients. Our new Truist digital experience for Flex 2 of our core digital and technology principles; co-creation with our clients and failing fast to learn fast. We built this new platform based directly on clients feedback, and we're introducing it in waves, learning from each release and getting better every time. We made great progress in the third quarter, inviting approximately 7 million retail wealth and small business clients to migrate to the Truist digital experience through September. But half of those clients have started and use the platform in lieu of their heritage app. By the end of this quarter, our goal is to migrate all digital clients to the Truist digital platforms. We've received ongoing feedback from our clients on incorporated opportunities for improvement iteratively over the course of the migration, which has resulted in an improved client experience over time. This de-risk our Core Bank conversion and makes Truist the first to de-link the front-end conversion from the back-end. A patented approach we can leverage for future back-end innovation. As you can see on Slide 10, we continue to experience healthy demand for digital banking services as our clients look for more convenient and effective ways to transact and manage their finances. The pace of digital adoption has been especially rapid in mobile. Active mobile users and Zelle transactions are up 11% and 58% respectively, year-over-year. Last quarter, I highlighted that we are creating a common core digital architecture and platform for retail wealth and small business clients, which creates agility and seamless client experiences, yet ones that are tailored and designed for the unique needs of each client segment. For our wealth clients, we provide a differentiated digital client experience that reflects their relationship with Truist. An integrated platform will provide a one-stop-shop for their holistic financial picture, including a unified investment portfolio experience that is agnostic to whether the account is a trust or brokerage account, holistic financial planning with external account aggregation, and the ability to secure, store, and exchange documents for their advisor, and the same access to low cost digital and automated investing that we now offer retail clients. Turning to slide 11, on an absolute basis, loans declined 2.4 billion sequentially. However, if you exclude the impact of PPP forgiveness, average loans increased 1.6 billion or 2.3% annualized consistent with our outlook. When you peel back the onion, there's some good trends, but we also have headwinds. PPP declined $4 billion on average in the quarter, and Dealer Floor Plan declined an additional billion. We expect PPP to decline an additional 2 billion or so on average in the fourth quarter. Dealer utilization is about 25%, well below historical averages. We've been somewhat cautious in CRE, although we're beginning to see opportunities in that space that meet our risk appetite and portfolio diversity objectives. Even so, that portfolio declined 1.2 billion sequentially. Excluding these items, Commercial Loans increased 1.1 billion or 0.9% sequentially. So we're seeing some improved momentum, More banking regions are experiencing core C&I growth. Pipelines in the Commercial Community [Indiscernible] and CRE businesses continue to grow. And our revolver exposure also grew 2% sequentially. Evidence of our relevance that our clients are building capacity for investments and expansion. Big picture, our corporate and commercial clients remain optimistic, but labor shorter -- shortages of supply chain issues are affecting their businesses no different than Truist. Net-net, we believe there is meaningful upside to the C&I growth story as the economy continues to improve, pandemic-related disruption subside, and the liquidity-related distortions from ongoing government stimulus abate. But the timing of all this is difficult to predict. On the consumer slide, mortgage has shifted from a shrinking to a growing portfolio, reflecting increased operational capacity, slower prepaid speeds, and our tactical decision to balance sheet correspondent production. We're also seeing good performance with indirect auto, Light Stream, [Indiscernible] and credit card, all of which are growing versus last quarter. So turning to slide 12, we added this slide, this quarter to broad a little more color on growth in headwinds for average loans since there are several significant moving pieces. Long-term loan growth as an output and a highly correlated economic growth, which we believe is on firm footing, particularly in our markets. We also continue to pursue tactics and strategies to capture more than our fair share of loan growth within our risk appetite diversification objectives, including deepening our lending relationships with our wealth clients, increasing our digital and point-of-sale lending capabilities, and expanding our wallet share within certain corporate and commercial clients. Turning to slide 13. Average deposits increased 6.5 billion or 1.6% compared to the second quarter, largely due to the continuing effects of recent government stimulus. More importantly, Truist continues to resonate with clients. We continue to make solid progress with quality account growth. Year-to-date, our net new personal DDA accounts grew almost 50,000 significantly higher than last year. Net new business DDA is up 11% year-over-year. In addition, client attrition from closed branches continues to be very low. This performance reflects excellent execution by our retail Community Bank teammates. And with that, let me turn it over to Daryl to review our financial performance in greater detail. Daryl Bible : Thank you, Bill. And good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 14, net interest income was down slightly versus prior quarter. This was consistent with our guidance and reflected two competing factors. Purchase accounting accretion decreased 53 million [Indiscernible] quarter, and contributed 23 basis points to reported margin, down from 28 basis points in the second quarter. However, core non-interest income increased 41 million. This was driven by a larger investment portfolio, which resulted in strong deposit growth. We have more than offset lower PPP revenue. Core net interest margin decreased two basis points due to higher liquidity and lower PPP revenue. We expect to earn an additional 125 million in PPP revenues over the coming three quarters and for the balance to be demonyms by mid-2022. We continue to be asset-sensitive. We estimate that 100 basis point ramp increase would increase Nii by 4.1%. A 100 basis point shock would increase NII by 7.9%. We're also well-positioned to benefit from rising rates, at both the short and long end of the curve. 2/3 of our reported asset sensitivity is from the short end, and it assumes a deposit beta of approximately 50%. In reality, we have experienced, over the last few years ago, deposit betas are likely to be significantly lower than our modeled assumptions when the first few rate hikes. For every 10% decline in deposit beta, our asset sensitivity increases by about 100 basis points. Moving to Slide 15. As Bill highlighted, we had a very strong quarter from a fee income perspective. Fee income, excluding security gains from last year, was up a very strong 12% like quarter exceeding our initial expectations. Insurance income increased 25% in total. This was due to acquisitions and also a very strong 12% organic growth. Investment banking at its best -- had its second-best quarter and record M&A performance. M&A results like this do not come in a vacuum, they're results of years of investment and commitment to our clients. Capital markets earn revenue was up 22% year-to-date. Growth remains very strong up 10% compared to a year ago as a result of market conditions but also positive asset flows. [Indiscernible] -related income was down after its record second-quarter performance, but momentum continues to be positive. Residential Mortgage was down [Indiscernible] quarter due to lower refinance activity. However, it increased 62 million sequentially, primarily due to better servicing income due to lower prepayment speeds and the addition of a new servicing portfolio. Production income also improved sequentially as we restored capacity after temporary reducing it last quarter. Other income of 131 million was also another high-water mark, largely due to valuation gains related to our SBIC funds. Our non-qualified plan continues to have positive valuation adjustments and we have now included the details of both the non-qualified plan and CVA in our earnings release tables. Turning to expenses on Slide 16. Adjusted non-interest expense increased 2.4% sequentially compared to our guidance of a relatively flat. Drivers included higher-than-anticipated fee income, which pushed incentives above our forecast, in addition to 32 million cost from the non-qualified plan. Excluding the effects of these items, adjusted expenses were only slightly above our expectations. On an absolute basis, adjusted non-interest expense increased primarily due to higher planned marketing costs, as we continue to build our brand awareness, as well as higher technology costs which are reflected in software and equipment expense. Moving to Asset quality on Slide 17. Asset Quality remains excellent, reflecting our prudent risk culture, diversified portfolio, favorable economic conditions, and the effects of stimulus. Our net charge-off ratio was 19 basis points, a pro forma post-financial crisis well. Leading indications -- indicators remain strong as MPLc and early-stage delinquencies remain low. Our AOOO coverage ratio decreased to 1.65% as the economic scenarios continue to improve, and -- but still remains above our CSO day one level 1.54%. We also had a provision benefit of 324 million. Continuing on slide 18, capital remains strong. Our CET1 ratio of 10.1% was above our near-term. 9.75% target. We did not repurchase any shares during the third quarter due to the effects of the recent acquisition activity. We have approximately 1 to 2 billion of potential capital deployment remaining through the third quarter of 2022. We expect to consume approximately 500 million of this capacity via share repurchases in the fourth quarter, reflecting our own capital position, reduced integration risks on the heels of very successful integration event we discussed earlier. Turning to Slide 19, we provide additional details about Service Finance. We continue to be very excited about Service Finance, and the acquisition is on track to close later this year. Service Finance is strategically attractive because it expands the scale and capabilities of our existing point-of-sale businesses, which is where the consumer preferences are shifting. In addition, we believe home improvement is in a secular growth phase, and the professional financing market is highly fragmented. Service Finance is the perfect partner for Truist, given its proven track record of business development and growth, its exclusive focus on home improvement, strong digital client experience, and excellent reputation in the marketplace. From a financial perspective, we have provided a few additional details to help you model the transaction. The vast majority of Service Finance revenue will come in net interest income. The NII is a mix of consumer interest income, and discounts provided by the merchants. Loan yields are in the high single-digits from a run rate perspective, though initially they are somewhat lower due to the impact of promotional period on an unseasoned loan portfolio. We expect production to grow at a fast pace over the coming years. We expect to allocate 1.1 billion to goodwill and 700 million to intangibles. We also expect to capture approximately 250 million in value over time from a step-up in tax basis. On a standalone basis, the acquisition is 4% GAAP dilutive in year 1. Half of this dilution is driven by the utilization of capital in lieu of share repurchases. The other half is driven by the first-year GAAP net income contribution. Earning streams take time to build as we transition from an originate-to-sell to an originate-to-hold model. But over the long term, it is extremely profitable and accretive to all of our KPIs. We did not model any future revenue synergies, but see many opportunities for better leverage, our combined capabilities, and accelerate our revenue and growth potential. We have terminated third-party partnerships with certain point-of-sale financing providers. The impact of this is 2 billion of runoff will begin in early 2022. Moving to the integration update on Slide 21. As Bill highlighted, we achieved a major milestone this past weekend with successful migration of our heritage BB&T retail and commercial clients to the Truist ecosystem. Another milestone in the quarter was completing the migration of our Truist retail mortgage origination platform. Turning to slide 22, we are committed to achieving 1.6 billion of net cost saves, and continue to make progress in each of the five categories. Third-party spend is down 11.2% from the baseline levels, exceeding our targeted reduction at 10%. We closed 39 branches during the third quarter, bringing the cumulative closures to 413. We're still on track to achieve approximately 800 total closures by the first quarter of 2022. We are also 7/8 of the way towards our non-branch facility reduction target, which will likely have more reductions to come in 2022. Average FTEs are down 11% since the merger, excluding the acquisitions. We expect further declines in FTEs in the coming quarters to the -- due to the VSRP program, where the first quarter-wave of departures began on September 30th. Technology sales will materialize after redundant systems are decommissioned in 2022. We have also noted areas where we continue to make critical investments, including digital technology, talent, and acquisitions in select business lines. Turning to Slide 23, we still expect to incur total merger costs of approximately 4 billion through 2022. We have incurred cumulative merger costs of approximately 3 billion through the third quarter, reflecting a considerable integration work on Slide 21. We continue to expect these costs to decrease after the first quarter of final bank conversion and then drop off entirely after 2022. Continuing on Slide 24. Core non-interest expense was just over 3 billion in the third quarter. As a reminder, this calculation removes the effects of higher variable compensation due to fee income and corporate performance since 2019. Asset value changes in our retirement plan and acquisitions since the merger of equals. As a result, Core non-interest expense is more comparable to our baseline expenses at the time of the merger closed. Based on the trajectory of ongoing cost-save initiatives, we are on track to achieve the fourth quarter Core expense target. I will now provide guidance for the fourth quarter. Reported net interest margin is expected to decrease 5 to 7 basis points, with half attributable to lower purchase accounting and accretion, and the other half due to increased liquidity and less PPP revenue. We expect reported net interest income to decline 1% sequentially, entirely due to lower purchase accounting accretion. Core net interest income is expected to be stable. Fee income, excluding the non-qualified plan, is expected to be largely stable from the third quarter as strength of insurance, investment, banking, wealth, and CRE, is offset by lower mortgage revenue and lower SBIC valuation gains. Adjusted non-interest expense is expected to decrease 3% to 4% from the third quarter. The primary drivers are personnel expense driven primarily by VSRP, occupancy expense, and technology cost such as software and equipment expense. For those that leverage our core expense target for the fourth quarter to build the adjusted expenses, you must add back the impact of acquisitions and higher levels of incentive compensation expense, from the higher fees and performance relative to 2019. We expect net charge-off ratio to be 20 to 30 basis points given favorable economic conditions, although we expect some normalization of these levels over time. Finally, we expect further reductions in the A-Triple low ratio, assuming economic conditions remain healthy. Given all this, Truist should have positive operating leverage next quarter when compared to the third. Now I will turn it back to Bill to conclude. Bill Rogers : Thanks Daryl. Slide 25 provides an overview of our value proposition. Made the details, obviously we've shared in the past. But flipping to slide 26 that provides some performance highlights that support our value proposition with actual performance this quarter. Our markets continue to have strong in-migration, the data of which can lag, fee income from insurance investment banking and wealth was up 20% year-over-year, and up approximately a billion dollars compared to 2019. our third-quarter results clearly reflect the potential for profitability levels to be industry leading as we come out of the merger. Lastly, we continue to deploy more capital on behalf of our clients and shareholders, and we'll have that capacity to do more over time as integration risk subside and the economy stays on sound footing. So in conclusion, the effects of the pandemic are moderate, economy is getting better. We are one major step away from completing our integration process. We're beginning to shift from a more defensive to a more offensive position and from a merger focus to performance focus. We fully believe that Truist best days are ahead. So with that, Ankur, let me turn it back over to you and Q&A. Daryl Bible : Thanks, Bill. Allen, at this time, if you don't mind explaining how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session. As you do that, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourselves to 1 primary question and 1 follow-up so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator instructions]. If you are using a speakerphone, please make sure that your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. And like Mr. Vyas said, please limit yourselves to 1 question and 1 follow-up question. We'll first go to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Bill Rogers : Morning. Ankur Vyas : Morning Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Thanks. I had a first question just around the Service Finance acquisition. And I just wanted to understand how you're thinking about leveraging this acquisition from here, both on the merchant side, as well as on the customer side, talking about opportunities for expansion and integration into your platform, and then on the customer side cross-sell. Bill Rogers : Yeah. Betsy, it's a great question. As Daryl mentioned, we didn't model any of that into the basic models. The basic model you saw is for the Service Finance as a standalone. One of the really attractive parts of this integration for Truist, it was the fact that they've developed relationships with 14 thousand contractors, 180 manufacturers, just so to think about that in context or 80 manufacturers, think about that in context, many of those which are existing clients of Truist.  We've got this incredible opportunity to expand those relationships, they are adding a lot of new clients to our base who are single-product clients, who we got an opportunity to expand using things like Light Stream and the capabilities that we have there using the prowess of our CIB bankers with the manufacturers, helping expand with the contractors. There's a whole another component to service finance, which is really interesting as the whole ESG Ps of what they're doing to create more energy efficiency, and the concept of just everything related to home improvement.  What we really like about service finance, it's a pure-play on the home side. If you think about all of the things that we have related to home. Think about insurance that we have related to home, think about home equity, think about mortgage, think about all the prowess and product and capabilities we have related to home.  We're just starting to explore those kind of opportunities. This is why we feel so good about this. This to us is where the buck's going, as I said, versus where it is. And to your question, I think those are significant opportunities ahead of us. Daryl Bible : And what I would add to that, Betsy, is that the returns on this will be eventually over 3% ROE business, and our risk-adjusted yield will be really attractive. Bill Rogers : Yeah, just on the standalone. Yeah, exactly. Daryl Bible : Annual basis. Betsy Graseck : Follow-up question here, Daryl on the rate sensitivity, you did give us the first 100 basis points. And I know that the question is going to be, what about that second 100 basis points? The first 100 is really low deposit beta 15% historically, I think you mentioned, can you remind us what the deposit beta was like on that second 100? Thanks. Daryl Bible : If you go back to the last rate cycle that we went to, it was basically when rates bottomed out that Fed moved up 6 times 150 basis points. If you look at the deposit betas the first probably 2 or 3 deposit betas was probably about plus or minus 20%. And then as it continued to climb, it was getting closer to 30% to 40%. I'm not sure if it ever really got to the 50% in the 6 moves that you saw there, but it gradually went up as every couple of moves happened in the last rebound with the Fed. Betsy Graseck : Right, so you never -- you never got over 100 or anything like that on those last couple of moves? Daryl Bible : No, I don't think we ever got to 50% beta on any even [Indiscernible]. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Alright, thanks so much. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Hey, good morning guys. Daryl Bible : Good morning Ryan. Ryan Nash : Daryl, maybe to start on the expenses. So you are reiterating the 294 billion and you're calling for expenses to decline 3%-4%. Can you maybe just talk high level about some of the puts and takes of -- on expenses as we move into 2022? Clearly the core is coming down due to expense saves, but we're hearing about cost inflation is increasing. You have a handful of insurance deals and insurance finance as well as investments in the business. So how should we think about the costs into '22 and maybe can they be down on an absolute or an adjusted basis into next year? Thanks. Daryl Bible : Yeah. We're still putting together our plan for 2022, but I'll tell you what I can tell you now. From a cost perspective, we have our 5 buckets that we talk about. We definitely will see more branch closures in the first half of 2022, with almost 400 more branches closing. They also will have more -- last corporate real estate, so more reductions in that space as 2022 comes along.  The big cost savings in technology will happen as we phase through the conversions in the first quarter, the decommissioning. We're going to reduce about 40% of the application systems and move towards from six data centers to three data centers, that will be big reductions in cost saves.  Bill talked about our continuation of our VSRP that will continue throughout in 2022. And then finally, we have that team-led synergies program to basically get synergies on expenses and revenues, and that will play out over the next couple of years. That will assure us to make sure that we get our expense targets and also give us ammunition to make more investments in digital technology and other talents. Ryan Nash : Got it. And Bill, last quarter you were talking about green shoots in loan growth, and this quarter, I think it sounded a little bit more balanced. You are talking about core momentum. Can you maybe just talk about expectations for loan growth over the next few quarters on both the consumer and the commercial side?  What do you see as some of the drivers? And could we see something like Service Finance starting to help drive accelerating growth on the consumer side? Thanks. Daryl Bible : Before you start, can I finish that? From still '22 expenses, inflation is real and inflation is definitely going to be in our numbers. If you look at the last couple of years, we did not really factor our end inflation in '20 and '21. And not sure exactly what that number is, but it's probably, give or take around 2% of fee expense base.  And you also have to factor in acquisitions as well for '22, and the impact of that would have both revenue and expense. But at the end of the day we're going to have good overall operating leverage, probably top quartile when it's all said and done. Bill Rogers : Yeah. Thanks for that addition, Daryl. But I think to that question, Ryan, that's the focus. I mean there are tons of puts and takes, but we're going to hit the expense targets that we committed to. I mean I feel very, very confident about that, and have a business that creates positive operating leverage and industry-leading efficiency.  That's the shift and the target that we're headed to. I didn't mean to imply that they weren't green shoots, I still think there are definitely green shoots, and I think they manifested themselves in this quarter, as we highlighted. When I think about loan growth as an output, output, I look at production pay downs, utilization, and pipelines selling those 4 elements and then try to see where they're going. On the production side, we're hitting some high points in the quarter for C&I and consumers, our production is strong.  Paydowns stayed pretty consistent. Paydowns are about where they have been. Utilization is still pretty flat, you could say grinding up in certain areas, but in fairness probably pretty flat. But pipelines are strong. In CIG and CRE and CCB for us, we're at high points for the last several quarters in pipelines. So it's hard to guide. If I said, view it as medium-term X PPP, I think low single-digit growth is at the forefront.  But our positioning sort of longer-term when liquidity comes out of this, I just feel great about our -- great about our positioning, and our capacity to -- we've grown our revolvers, so our utilization going up, the fantastic markets we're in, the business investments that we've made and talent, the consumer businesses as you pointed out, point-of-sale businesses, things that are just adding capabilities and adding more opportunity for us to capture growth as we go forward. So I -- so yes, I think there are green shoots, hard to predict when they're going to grow. But I feel really, really good about how we're positioned. Ryan Nash : Great, thanks for all the color, Bill. Operator : All right. The next question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard? Gerard, your line might be on mute. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. I was on mute. I appreciate it. Good morning, gentlemen. Bill Rogers : Morning. Gerard Cassidy : Bill, can you share with us -- you've done some smaller acquisitions. Obviously, the most recent one is the finance Company, and then the insurance companies. Can you give us your picture of what you see, maybe, for added bolt-on opportunities that could be on the horizon for Truist? Bill Rogers : Yeah. I'd say first, as Core Truist, I think the biggest opportunity is with Truist. I see the biggest opportunity to actualize and optimize the opportunity that came from this fantastic merger vehicle, so let me say that, as it's primary where we are going. But then the bolt-on, clearly on the insurance side.  I mean, we've had a fantastic track record on the insurance side. It is a really good toggle between organic and inorganic growth and managed well, and I would expect that to continue. Maybe other things that look around and bolt-on that are important to us strategically and add some scale; We've been adding a lot of talent. I view that as the equivalent of an acquisitions, so we've been adding talent and you see the benefits of that, for example, in the investment -- in the investment banking side.  But I think if you [Indiscernible], bolt-on and the places where we've -- where we're experienced or where we have opportunity, and then primary emphasis on Truist and maximizing and optimizing this merger. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you. And maybe this question could be directed at Clarke. The credit quality for you and many of your peers has been outstanding, particularly in the net charge-off area. Can you guys give us a flavor of how sustainable are these levels of very low net charge-offs, is it another 2 or 3 quarters and then maybe a creeping up to normalization as we enter '23 or end of '22? Clarke Starnes : It's great question, Gerard, on what is the lower longer question for the industry. And I would say for us in the industry, we had significant stimulus, the accommodation programs, and frankly strong asset values, and all of those have been tailwinds. And you saw for us almost really historic low loss point for the quarter. So we feel really good about where we are, and given the current economic backdrop, we would certainly expect to continue to see outperformance with, to your point, a steady return over time to normalization as we go into '22 and beyond. And so I think it can go on longer. It again depends on the economics scenario.  But for us right now, I think we would believe we have an opportunity to outperform and you will see that reflected in our 4Q guidance. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hi, guys. Good morning. Hey, Bill. Bill Rogers : Good morning. Ken Usdin : Just when you think longer-term out about the points you made about operating leverage, efficiency, maybe there's some inflation, the business mix has changed. How confident are you -- do you remain in that low 50s long-term efficiency ratio and how much, if at all, is rates still part of that equation? Thanks. Bill Rogers : Yeah, I would start with industry-leading efficiency. So let me start without the concept. I think given some normalization and rates, I feel really confident in the low 50s. But most importantly, being able to achieve positive operating leverage, being able to be industry-leading top or top quartile efficiency, I think, is imminently short, medium, and long-term achievable for Truist. Ken Usdin : Okay. Got it. And then, just on the near-term perspective, can you just -- Daryl, can you just walk us through, when we take the 2940 in the slides and you kind of add back the add-backs, where approximately does this put us as a starting point for the end of the year on a GAAP basis for cost? Daryl Bible : Yeah. If you go back, you have to add back in incentive pieces on the acquisition pieces, as well as whatever non-qualified turns out to be, plus or minus. You probably get to -- we gave guidance on an adjusted expense number down 3% to 4% from where we are today. That is your starting off point for 2022. Ken Usdin : Okay. Got it. And then we add back intangibles for the all-in. Daryl Bible : That's correct. Ken Usdin : Thank you. Operator : All right. Next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. Bill, you took over as CEO about a month ago and also announced changes to the senior leadership team. Obviously, all of these guys have been in very prominent roles since the deal was announced, I wouldn't expect meaningful changes. But any kind of tweak that we should expect or what was the process of picking who does what underneath you given some of changes? However you want to frame that. Thank you. Bill Rogers : Yeah. The great thing, Matt, is we have an incredibly strong, skilled, experienced, purposeful team. So I'm really fortunate to be surrounded by really great leaders. As you noted, we didn't want to put a lot of change in place because actually I feel really good about the momentum and where things are going.  So the leaders who were responsible for those businesses, we shifted a couple of things around, but they still have the primary responsibility that they had before. I'd say the shift though is more -- what I talked about in my opening statements, it's more of a transition from merging to operating.  That doesn't have anything to do with me or anything. It just has to do with the timing of where we are in those process. Getting this merger -- major conversion this weekend was just a shot of adrenaline for us, to be fair. I mean, that's a big significant milestone for us. And just gives us more confidence to be starting to shift some of our time, some of our responsibility, some of our focus to maximizing the opportunities that are true.  So I would say, if I were to describe the transition and what it feels may be different now, is that -- it's more of that. And I just think that's a function of timing and where we are and our confidence building. Matt O'Connor: And then just separately, can you talk about the retention of some of the front office client-facing folks really across the franchise? I would imagine initially there wasn't that much movement because of COVID, and I think you also had some retention agreement for key people. But just update us on how that's been going more recently as things have been opening up and maybe people in general are more open to looking elsewhere, not just at Truist, but the workplace overall. Chris Henson : Bill, let me put maybe a global perspective on it and then try to get a little more idiosyncratic to Truist. Globally, there's more activity and more people are moving and we see that particularly in some of the frontline areas and you don't drive around any place in the country where you don't see a help wanted sign, and we've got several million people out of the workforce right now.  So we and the industry are experiencing some of that. Going into this merger, our retention numbers in the first year to 18 months were actually better than they were at either Company. So our retention numbers were really, really good. They've turned over a spike up a little bit, but it's still I think below where the industry is. From everything that we can determine.  As it relates to some of our most senior team and what we look at, high performer turnover is one of the things that we look at in our senior team, I've been really pleased. We've been really solid and keeping the kind of players we want. The retention on those has been really good. The places that I worry about are frontline, teller, care centers, all those things, that's just a more challenging environment today than it was before.  And the other side of that is our ability to attract talent is fantastic. The people that wanted to join our Company and want to be part of what we're doing at Truist has exceeded any expectations that I might have had and they were really high. The opportunity for people that are here to grow and expand their careers and the opportunity to bring new talent in, I think is just really good at Truist. All that again with that global overlay of what's going on in the market in the world. Matt O'Connor: Understood. Thank you. Operator : Next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Hi, Bill. You've spoken a lot about investing in technology and digital, and I think the expenses were a little elevated before you taken over the CEO reins. So it's good seeing that you're guiding for expenses to be 3% to 4% lower next quarter. But can you just talk a -- I think it was your quote saying, once the hoods open, let's fix the engine a little bit more than we could have otherwise done.  Where is the digital dividend, so to speak, going to come from as it relates to Truist and the extra efforts that you're putting in place? We can talk about the back office, with the cloud, or the front office with enhanced digital banking that you maybe didn't have before. Thanks. Bill Rogers : Yeah. Mike, it's a great question. And I think about it in two ways, one digital dividend as you put it, but also the avoidance of opportunity cost. And that's really what's happening with this merger. So if you think about it in the core basis, we're creating a much more agile platform; so the ability to move fast, to add, to create more opportunities for our clients, our teammates on a more agile platform.  The base is really important. I didn't say we have a new state-of-the-art commercial ecosystem. We have a new state-of-the-art mortgage ecosystem. We have a new state-of-the-art digital platform. All of those in my mind are opportunity costs. So those are things we don't have to invest in disproportionately going forward, and they create the opportunity to expand and add to as we go into the next few years. The other part of that is something we call the digital straddle. This thing that we did to convert our clients digitally, I think, is actually fairly unique. And what that allows us to do again, from an agility standpoint, is to leverage that back-end platform, and through the use of APIs and the straddle, we can do a whole lot more for our clients than we could before. So when the hood is up, we've been looking at virtually everything.  The hood-up and the best of both mentality has allowed us to not only expand and create a better ecosystem, but I also look at it as a board of lot of opportunity cost in the future of having to do these major changes. Mike Mayo : You said you're still committed, I guess, to low 50s efficiency. It just seems like it's been a long way, stocks underperformed since the merger was announced despite a merger on paper that has the chance to be best merger as ever, and I think part of the reason for the under performance may have been, you had the pandemic, you had the low rate s, so there are some excuses there.  But looking ahead, are you able to commit to positive operating leverage next year? Given the way -- given all these investments, you're avoiding costs, you're getting gains from the technology investments. I think it's -- investors are thinking let's see more of that digital dividend. Let's see more of that payoff. How much can you lead us or give a little bit more hope as it relates to positive operating leverage? Bill Rogers : Maybe I have that a little more than hope. No, I think it's totally reasonable to expect us to have positive operating for next year in the middle of this merger. And that's against investments we want to make. That's overcoming inflation. That's overcoming all the other things that exist : rate, environment, pandemic, all those type things. Now, we're committed to having a business that has positive operating leverage and has industry-leading efficiency. There's no -- I feel more confident about that today than I did the day we announced the merger. It's sometimes hard to peel back the Clouds in the merger costs, in the one-times, and all of that to see that. But the underlying capacity of our Company to deliver a positive operating leverage growth on the top line and world-class efficiency is absolutely there. Mike Mayo : All right. Next year, positive operating leverage and debt, you're committed to that. And this is your first earnings call as the CEO. Did I hear that correctly? Bill Rogers : That is absolutely what will be in our plan for next year. Mike Mayo : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : All right. Next, we'll go to John McDonald with Autonomous Research. John McDonald : Morning, Daryl. I just want to clarify the outlook for net interest income next quarter. I think you said on a reported basis down 1% on a core net interest income flattish. Just clarify if that was the guide and then how does that set you up more broadly for growing NII into 2022 when you think about all the puts and takes there. Daryl Bible : Yes. So you are correct. We will have stable NII on the core basis in the fourth quarter. We'll be down 1% just because of purchase accounting, accretion. As '22 plays out -- when I look at '22, as we put this together, the three break drivers of NI, the impacts will be loan growth, deposit growth depending on how large the balance sheet gets and how much liquidity we invest, and then interest rates.  When I look at all that, I think it's very possible that -- I'm very sure that the core [Indiscernible] income will grow. I think we have a chance of having an offset overall that run-off of purchase accounting. It doesn't take a huge amount of loan growth coupled with a Fed move, that's not in the implied right now.  But even as steepening of the yield curve would add. If you just steepen the yield curve like 25 basis points, that would give us another 100 million in for the year next year. I think there's a lot of variables that could play out, but we feel pretty good that trajectory of core mar -- net interest margin will rise in '22, and that our reported net interest margin should be relatively stable if we can offset that. John McDonald : And Bill, just a bigger picture question in terms of the capital target and what you need to run the Company. You brought down the capital target CET1 to 975. It seems like you'll get there with the Service Finance acquisition soon. So longer-term, what will be the factors as you think about lowering that capital to maybe something closer to what shares that look like you target on CET1? Bill Rogers : And, John, remember we also announced we'll do some more share repurchase this quarter to get there faster. We've said all along and we went into the merger with a little bit of a higher capital base, very intentionally. And what we said was, as the risk of the merger decreases and the solid definition of the economy increases, we have a Company that has a lower-than-average risk profile and a higher-than-average PPNR profile.  I think we will start thinking about capital positions that reflect that. We don't want to do this on a quarter-by-quarter basis. This is sort of a long-term strategy and philosophy. But this weekend was a good milestone for us in terms of reducing the risk of the merger and our confidence at where we are in the first part of next year.  We'll get that behind us, and we'll continue to evaluate where we are from a capital standpoint. No reason to think we are going to change the profile of our Company, our diversifications, our risk profile is going to stay strong, and we're confident in the PPR components of the growth in our business. John McDonald : Got it. Great. Not quarter-to-quarter, but getting through the conversions will be a big factor as you think about lowering that target over time. Bill Rogers : Yeah. I think we've got to be in the first part of next year to have another conversation about this, but we're going to be thoughtful in moving to the existing target quickly. John McDonald : Got it. Thank you. Ankur Vyas : Allen, that completes our call. Thanks everybody for joining. We appreciate it. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to the IR team. We hope everybody has a great day. We appreciate your interest in Truist. Allen, you can now disconnect. Operator : Thank you, sir. And once again, everyone that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Ankur Vyas, Head of Investor Relations for Truist Financial Corporation. Please go ahead. Ankur Vyas : Thank you, Jake. And good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. With us today are our CEO, Bill Rogers, and our CFO, Daryl Bible. During this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's fourth quarter results and also share perspectives and how we continue to activate Truist purpose, our progress on the merger, and current business conditions. Clarke Starnes, our Chief Risk Officer; Beau Cummins, our Vice Chair, and John Howard, our Chief Insurance Officer, are also in attendance and are available to participate in the Q&A portion of the call.  The accompanying presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the Truist IR site, ir.truist.com. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on slides 2 and 3 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures, as well as the appendix for the appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. In addition, Truist is not responsible for, and does not edit nor guarantee, the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized live and archived webcast are on our website.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill. William Rogers Jr.: Thanks, Ankur. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining our call. We hope that your new year is off to a good start and that you and your families are doing well.  I'm very pleased with Truist's strong fourth quarter results. Fee income was solid, reflecting our diverse business mix of favorable conditions and investment banking and insurance. Net interest income is starting to improve, exceeding expectations. Credit quality was outstanding, resulting in another provision benefit. We delivered on our expense goals as adjusted non-interest expense decreased almost 4% and drove 3% sequential positive operating leverage. Loan growth, excluding PPP, is strengthening and we have momentum going into this year. I'll share more details on these topics during the presentation. And turning to slide 4. As always, I'm going to begin with purpose which is to inspire and build better lives and communities. We believe our purpose-driven culture is the foundation for our success as a company. Our purpose defines how we do business every day and it serves as a framework for how we make decisions.  Our purpose-driven culture is also the foundation for how we attract and retain top talent. People simply want to work for and do business with companies that stand for something meaningful. This culture, combined with our comprehensive compensation and benefit packages, significant and ongoing training development and career mobility and our more flexible approach to work will be our formula for attracting and retaining the best talent at Truist and competing and winning in the ongoing war for talent.  Slide 5 highlights some of the ways we're putting our purpose into action. This slide is organized around the same major themes contained in our CSR and our ESG report since they are topics that are most relevant to all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders. I could not be more proud of both the quantity and, most importantly, the quality of the work being done across all these dimensions and the tremendous impact we're having in our communities. While I can't cover every point on the slide, let me highlight a few. On the technology front, we were excited to welcome our teammates to the recently completed Innovation and Technology Center in Charlotte. I look forward to our external grand opening in the first half of the year.  As you know, Truist has an unwavering commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. And I'm very pleased to report that we recently achieved our goal to increase ethnically diverse representation in senior leadership roles to at least 15%. This was a year earlier than our original commitment. While we're proud to have achieved this milestone, we acknowledge that this is actually the beginning and not the end.  We've also intentionally implemented a flexible work strategy for our teammates, which includes onsite, remote and hybrid options. Hybrid and more flexible work is here to stay. And I've learned the meaning and the power of intentional flexibility, the concept of people coming together as a team, whether in the office or not, and intentionally deciding what works best for them, their team, our clients and the company, while remaining highly engaged and, most importantly, purposeful. Finally, we released our inaugural TCFD report in mid-December, which adds further context and disclosures to our previous CSR and ESG reports. At Truist, we view all the elements of ESG as an opportunity to improve our company and operationalize our purpose, including climate change. For instance, we're adding new teammates within CIB and our commercial community bank who are going to help our clients transition to a lower carbon economy.  Now, turning to slide 7, this quarter, we had $163 million of after-tax, merger related and restructuring charges and $165 million of after-tax incremental operating expenses related to the merger. The total EPS impact of merger-related costs was $0.25 a share. While our decision to create a best of both model of integration has resulted in increased upfront cost, I firmly believe it creates the best platform for future investment and growth. The good news is that total merger costs will be cut approximately in half in 2022 compared to last year and then fall out of our expense base entirely after this year.  Now turning to our fourth quarter performance on slide 8. As I indicated, the fourth quarter was a strong finish to a solid year as most areas were generally in line or somewhat ahead of our expectations. We earned $1.5 billion or $1.13 earnings per share for the quarter on a reported basis. Excluding the merger impacts on the prior slide, we earned $1.9 billion or $1.38 per share. Primary driver of changes in EPS relative to both the prior quarter and the year ago was the loan loss provision, given the rapidly evolving economic environment over the past two years.  We generated strong returns, including 22.6% adjusted ROTCE, which was unchanged from last quarter. Excluding the reserve release, adjusted ROTCE was still a very strong 19.6%.  Asset quality continues to be an excellent story and net charge-offs were in line with our guidance. Capital deployment was robust during the fourth quarter as we funded strong organic loan growth, closed the service finance acquisition in early December and repurchased $500 million worth of common stock. We'll provide more details about loan growth momentarily.  On the merger integration front, we completed the first part of the core bank conversion in mid-October by migrating our heritage BB&T clients to the Truist ecosystem. As part of the conversion, we launched the new truist.com as well as our digital commerce account opening platform. Since then, our integration teams have completed two successful dress rehearsals for a final conversion, one in mid-December and one just this past weekend. I want to personally thank our teammates for their hard work and dedication to this effort. Because of them, we're on track for the final core conversion in February, during which our heritage SunTrust clients will be migrated to the Truist ecosystem. Looking at full-year 2021, Truist had a productive year across multiple dimensions. From a financial perspective, we generated significant adjusted net income of $7.5 billion or $5.53 per share and had an adjusted ROTCE of 22%.  While our earnings undoubtedly benefited from a $3 billion lower loan loss provision due to the improving economy, we also demonstrated the strength of our diverse business mix. Fee income, excluding security gains, increased a very strong 10% as we were firing on multiple cylinders. This performance helped offset a 45% decline in mortgage fee income and a 6% decrease in net interest income.  We also continued to deliver on our cost save programs, evidenced by adjusted expenses increasing only 1% during the year, which saw much larger increases in fee income. We also experienced a reduction in our risk profile due to the improving economy and merger integration progress, which enabled us to reduce the CET1 target by 25 basis points to 9.75 and deploy significantly more capital.  Overall, we were able to make great progress on multiple fronts despite continued headwinds from the pandemic, while delivering improved financial performance for our shareholders. Now turning to slide 10. Our new Truist digital experience reflects two of our core digital and technology principles, co-creation with our clients and moving fast in order to learn fast.  Our more modern and agile platform allows us to incorporate this feedback quickly, the results of which can be seen in the significant improvements in our overall client satisfaction scores, as well as in our Apple App Store and Google Play store ratings in just a few short months. We've now migrated approximately 9 million retail, wealth and small business clients to the Truist digital experience through December, more than 85% of active clients have begun to use the new digital platform in lieu of their heritage app.  On slide 11, you'll see a visual of our new corporate and commercial digital platform, which we'll call a Truist One View. This platform will provide our clients with a comprehensive view of their existing treasury management and lending solutions via streamlined and client-specific experience designed to reduce the time required to perform routine financial task. Including the launch of Truist One View to our commercial clients, Truist has introduced new web and mobile platforms for each of our client segments across retail, wealth, business and corporate. More than 2,000 features were released across these platforms in 2021, and we've done this at a pace that neither heritage company could have achieved on their own.  More broadly, as you can see from the charts on the left, we continue to position ourselves to serve the robust demand for digital services. Digital lending, mobile check deposits, and Zelle transactions all exhibited double-digit growth during the year. We feel good about our current digital performance, and we believe that our progress will accelerate after the final core bank conversion, in part due to the advantages and efficiencies associated with having one website, one search engine optimization process, one brand, one system, and one digital application, but also in part due to the new capabilities that we'll be able to introduce this year, including our new AI-driven insights tool, our new Truist virtual assistant, and the Truist Developer Center, which will position us to innovate and collaborate with the developer community. Having our teams focus on the new Truist experience versus managing three separate experiences will provide a significant productivity lift as we move forward.  Lastly, we have plans to make strong digital progress in other areas this year from our new partnership and integration with AutoFi, enhancing our InsurTech capabilities via integrating insurance directly into our mortgage process, and launching a new deposit product with LightStream on a real-time cloud-based core.  Now, turning the loans and leases on slide 12. Average loans stabilized after decreasing for five consecutive quarters, and peeling back the onion reveals positive and improving underlying trends. Excluding PPP, average loans increased approximately 1% sequentially and end of period loans grew approximately 2%, reflecting momentum late in the quarter.  The most notable improvement was in C&I where end-of-period balances, excluding PPP, grew $6.3 billion or 5%, reflecting broad-based growth across corporate and commercial lines of business. This was the strongest point-to-point C&I loan growth since the first quarter of 2020. Most CIB, industry and product groups demonstrated growth, most notably within our asset finance group. Broad-based growth was also evident within our commercial community bank where 12 of the 21 regions grew C&I loans excluding PPP during the quarter and we continue to see the most growth in markets that are relatively more open. Every single one of our industry specialty groups within CCB grew, a strong reflection of how our clients value industry expertise and advice.  Revolver utilization also ticked up after six straight quarters of declines. And equally important, total revolver exposure continues to grow, evidence of our relevance and that our clients are building capacity for investments and expansion.  Residential mortgage continues to grow, reflecting slower prepayment speeds, our decision to balance sheet certain correspondent production, and increase capacity post conversions and COVID. Excluding mortgage, consumer balances decreased slightly, primarily due to seasonality in our Sheffield business and continued declines in our government guaranteed student loan portfolio. Service finance closed on December 6, and we feel great about their trajectory heading into 2022. In addition, some of the areas that have been headwinds like dealer floorplan and CRE are beginning to stabilize.  Overall, corporate commercial clients remain optimistic despite ongoing labor shortages, supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures. We're encouraged by the momentum we observed in the fourth quarter, but also on our pipelines, which are the highest they've been in some time. We continue to believe there's meaningful upside to the C&I growth story as the economy continues to improve, although the timing remains imprecise. We also continue to feel confident in our consumer trajectory as we're well positioned with respect to faster growing segments through our digital and point-of-sale businesses, which will offset headwinds in other areas.  Now turning to deposit fund, slide 13. Average deposits increased $8.2 billion or 2% compared to the third quarter, largely due to the continuing effects of recent government stimulus and seasonality related to public funds.  We've also been able to help our clients along their financial journey through our industry-leading child tax credit awareness initiative. Through this initiative, which promotes savings and financial confidence, clients and communities most in need were able to grow their savings and IRA balances by 9% and 15% respectively from May through December. I think this is a great example of what we call purposeful growth.  But we know we can do more, and thus guided by our purpose, we have been reinventing a new checking account experience that aligns with our clients' needs, which we believe will provide them more flexibility, lower cost and more financial confidence.  Truist One Banking will be our new flagship, differentiated and disruptive suite of checking solutions that redefine everyday banking and accelerate our journey towards purposeful growth.  Truist One will have zero overdraft fees. The capability to provide qualifying clients the liquidity they need via a simple $100 negative balance buffer, as well as a deposit based credit line limit of up to $750. These features will help clients manage their liquidity needs far more cost effectively than alternative products. You're going to learn more about these details right after this call. These solutions will be available to all clients this summer, given our need to first finish the conversion. In addition, Truist will discontinue overdraft protection, negative account balance and return item fees in the coming months for all existing accounts.  Long term, this is a win-win for all of our stakeholders as we'll increase client acquisition, particularly next gen clients, enhanced deposit growth and simply improve the overall client experience. In the near term, however, there will be a financial cost, both as a result of the introduction of Truist One and the reduction of other fees. We expect these changes collectively to result in an approximately $300 million or almost 60% reduction in overdraft-related revenue by 2024. The impact will begin in a few months and build over time as more clients benefit from the Truist One experience.  I'm now going to turn it over to Daryl to review our financial performance in more detail. Daryl Bible : Thank you, Bill. And good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 14. Net interest income was up slightly versus the prior quarter and ahead of our guidance of down 1%. The increase was primarily driven by larger securities portfolio as a result of ongoing deposit growth, which offset the expected decline in purchase accounting accretion. Net interest margin and core net interest margin performed in line with our guidance. Reported net interest margin declined 5 basis points, 2 basis points due to purchase accounting accretion and 3 basis points from core. The main drivers of the 3 basis point decline in core net interest margin were the impacts of lower PPP revenue and higher levels of liquidity. The PPP continues to wind down and we expect to earn an additional $60 million of PPP revenue over the coming two quarters.  Moving to slide 15. Overall, Truist intentionally maintained a balanced approach to managing interest rate risk, enhancing current earnings while being positioned to take advantage of higher rates both at the short and long ends of the curve. We estimate 100 basis point ramp increase in rates would increase NII by 5%, 100 basis points shock would increase NII by 10%. Approximately 75% of this reported asset sensitivity is from the short end of the curve.  As a rule of thumb, one 25 basis point Fed hike with a 25% beta would increase net interest income by $25 million per month and increase net interest margin 6 basis points, all else being equal.  Moving to slide 16. Reported fees were down 2% from last quarter, largely due to changes in our non-qualified plan. Absent the impacts of the non-qualified plan, fees performed well and were consistent with our guidance of relatively stable.  The driving factors of the stable performance quarter-over-quarter were investment banking and trading increased $61 million versus the prior quarter due to higher syndication fees, structured real estate and record M&A results; insurance income increased $21 million, primarily due to organic growth and seasonal improvements from the third to fourth quarter. These quarterly increases were offset by decline in other income of $107 million or $70 million excluding changes in the non-qualified plan, largely driven by the valuation adjustment for the Visa-related derivative and lower revenue from our SBIC funds. For the full-year 2021, excluding security gains, fees were up 10% versus the prior year or more than $800 million, propelled by our diverse business model, favorable market conditions and Truist's increasing size, scale and relevance across multiple businesses. We are also making good progress early in our IRM initiative, particularly between the connectivity between CCB, wealth and CIB. Insurance income increased 20% year-over-year, primarily driven by a very strong organic growth of 11% and acquisitions. This was our 99th year of insurance business, our best one yet, and we believe that 2022, our 100th year, can be even better.  Investment banking and trading was also up over $400 million, largely due to record performances of syndicated finance, M&A, equity, structured real estate and asset securitization. M&A revenue doubled relative to 2020 and the lead syndication roles in syndicated finance were up 26% year-over-year, both reflecting our strategic relevance to our clients.  On the flip side, residential mortgage income was down year-over-year $445 million or 45%, primarily due to a sharp decline on gain on sale margins and lower refinance activity. Turning to slide 17. Reported expenses were $3.7 billion for the quarter, including $212 million of merger-related costs and $215 million of incremental operating expenses related to the merger. Adjusted expenses decreased 3.9% sequentially, at the  end of our guidance of down 3% to 4%. Drivers for the decline include decreased personnel costs, which were a result of lower salary expenses, lower incentive costs, lower medical claims and changes in the non-qualified plan. Average FTEs declined 3%, including service finance from the prior quarter. Adjusted expenses also declined due to elevated equipment and marketing expenses in the third quarter. Full-year adjusted expenses were up only 1% despite the adjusted fee income growing 10% year-over-year. This limited increase demonstrates the cost saving success we have achieved throughout the year and our overall discipline on expense management.  Moving to slide 18. Asset quality remains excellent, reflecting our prudent risk culture, diverse portfolio, the favorable economic conditions and the effects of stimulus. Our net charge-off ratio increased to 25 basis points from 19 basis points in the third quarter due to seasonality in the consumer losses and lesser commercial recoveries. ALLL coverage ratio decreased to 1.53%, which is just below our CECL day one levels, resulting in a provision benefit of $103 million in the fourth quarter as the economic scenarios continue to improve.  Continuing on slide 19. Capital and liquidity levels remained very strong. Our CET1 ratio declined from 10.1% to 9.6%, driven by organic loan growth, share repurchases and the service finance acquisition. Our established near-term target for CET1 of 9.75% has not changed, although the ratio declined to 9.6% in the fourth quarter. We anticipate being somewhat below our 9.75% CET1 target in the near term, given the improving loan growth outlook and the CECL phase-in for the first quarter.  We also do not anticipate repurchasing any shares for the first half of 2022.  Moving to slide 21. We achieved major milestone in October with the successful migration of our BB&T retail and commercial clients to the Truist ecosystem. We have three significant integration milestones remaining, completing the Truist Digital First migration, finalizing the remaining branch consolidations in the first quarter, and the migration of our SunTrust retail and commercial clients to the Truist ecosystem, which will occur in February.  The visual culmination of this process will be 6,000 more Truist signs across our markets at branches, ATMs, retail and corporate offices, finally allowing us to serve as one brand for our clients. Once the integration is complete and all the systems have been converted, Truist will be a much simpler company to operate, allowing us to provide even better service to our clients.  Turning to slide 22. We continue to be committed to achieving our $1.6 billion of net cost saves and continue to make progress in each of the five categories. Third-party spend is down 11.5% from baseline levels, exceeding our targeted reduction of 10%. Our sourcing team continues to make great strides in achieving savings despite the impacts of inflation. And the good news is there are fewer contracts to renegotiate in 2022 due to the higher volume of contracts renegotiated during Truist's first two years. We are on track to deliver over 800 total branch closures by the first quarter of 2022. And we are about 90% of the way towards our non-branch facility reduction target. Average FTEs are down 11% since the merger excluding acquisitions. Additionally, technology savings were materialized after redundant systems are decommissioned in the second half of 2022.  Turning to slide 23. Core non-interest expense was $2.94 billion in the fourth quarter, meeting our target for the quarter. As a reminder, core non-interest expense is more comparable to our baseline expenses at the time the merger closed. Going forward, we will focus primarily on adjusted expenses, and not core, as adjusted expenses represent what we believe will be the run rate going forward.  I will now provide guidance for the full-year 2022 and for the first quarter. In 2022, we expect total revenue to grow 2% to 4% from 2021 as a result of higher net interest income, combined with solid growth in fees. The lower end of the range reflects two Fed hikes, with one in June and the second in December, while the upper end reflects 3 to 4 rate hikes throughout the year. This guidance includes the initial financial impact from the new Truist One account and related fee reductions in 2022. Adjusted non-interest expense is expected to only increase 1% to 2% in 2022 as a result of inflation, increased investments and expenses from acquisition in 2021, partially offset by the ongoing cost savings, including achieving our final cost save target in the fourth quarter of 2022.  Merger-related and restructuring costs and incremental operating expenses related to the merger are anticipated to be approximately $800 million in 2022, with these expenses going away in 2023.  Given these factors, we anticipate positive operating leverage on both a GAAP and adjusted basis in 2022. This is the primary metric we will hold ourselves accountable to this year.  We also expect net charge-offs ratio to be between 30 basis points and 40 basis points in 2022, given favorable economic conditions and the assumptions for normalization throughout the year, with some quarter-to-quarter variability. Excluding discrete items, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 20% and 21% if you model us on a taxable equivalent basis.  Looking into the first quarter, we expect total revenues to decline approximately 1% to 2% from fourth quarter levels. Given two fewer days, lower purchase accounting accretion and PPP revenue, continued pressures on mortgage and the typical seasonal patterns in certain fee categories like payments and service charges. This will be partially offset by seasonality and insurance.  Reported net interest margin should be down a couple of basis points due to lower purchase accounting accretion, although expect core to be relatively flat. We expect adjusted expenses to increase 1% to 2% next quarter from the fourth quarter levels, partially due to the seasonality and personnel expense, given FICA and 401(k) and partially due to higher marketing expense as we continue to roll out the Truist brand post conversions.  Now I'll turn it back to Bill to conclude. William Rogers Jr. : Thank you, Daryl. Slide 24 is our investment thesis which is built on four pillars or themes that we believe truly differentiate Truist and allow us to inspire and build better lives and communities as well as deliver purposeful growth for all of our stakeholders. I also think it's the same reason I've got the best job in banking. I shared color on this refreshed investment thesis with many of you in December.  So, on slide 25 and in summary and conclusion, Truist had a very good 2021, highlighted by improved financial performance, strong fee income from our diverse business model, significant capital deployment and strong risk management as evidenced by our excellent asset quality metrics. We also made substantial integration progress, taking many significant steps towards becoming One Truist.  As we look into 2022, our formula is going to be simple. First, we'll complete the merger in the first quarter, eliminate merger related costs by year-end and achieve our cost saves, all of which will help us produce positive operating leverage.  Second, we'll begin to pivot from an integration focus to an operating focus on executional excellence and growth. The momentum we have going into 2022, combined with being One Truist across all dimensions \u2013 technology, digital, brand, products, process \u2013 gives me great confidence in our performance and potential as we make and complete this pivot.  Lastly, we'll have the capacity to deploy more capital on behalf of our clients and shareholders as integration risks subside and the economy stays on sound footing.  So with that, let me turn it back over to Ankur for Q&A. Ankur Vyas : Thanks, Bill. Jake, at this time, if you'll explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session. As you do that, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary question and one follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today. Operator : . And we will begin with Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken, are you there? You might be muted. We're not hearing anything from Ken. We'll move to the next caller in the queue. Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: I was hoping to follow up on the expense guidance of 1% to 2% growth on an adjusted basis. There's obviously some puts and takes with the cost saves and the service finance. What are you thinking about underlying expense growth? I think, Daryl, you had talked about 3%. back in November. Is that still true? Or how do we think about that? Daryl Bible : Yeah, Matt. I think we were at the conference in the fourth quarter, we said we would have around 3% inflation. That's about $400 million. That's what we're ballparking for us for next year. We have the benefit, obviously, of having our third tranche of cost saves coming through in 2022, which really makes the adjusted expense growth pretty moderate versus not having those cost saves. Matt O'Connor: Just remind us the lift from service finance on the cost side starting in 1Q? Daryl Bible : About $20 million a quarter. Operator : John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : On your revenue guide of 2% to 4%, maybe could you just help us think about how that would break down. If you can unpack that by managers income versus fees, maybe give us a little bit of color how we should think about growth in 2022 on those fronts. Daryl Bible : If you looked at my prepared remarks, we talk about net interest income. We really right now have in our base forecast only two Fed increases, one in June and one in December. That's the lower end of the revenue guide. Obviously, if you look at the forwards markets where they are today, it's I think 3.8 times, so almost four Fed moves factored in. That would get us to the higher end of the curve. We gave you a couple of metrics. We're using a 25% beta in our rate sensitivity. And that 25% beta equates to about $25 million per month for every Fed increase that we have there. If you look back historically and look back at the recession that we had when Fed started to raise rates in 2015 and 2016, the betas for the first 100 basis points were 15%. And we're modeling 25%. So I think we're a little bit conservative on that side. We'll see how things play out. We are modeling a higher beta when you go up over 100 basis points. So, the next 100, we're at 35. And then anything over 35, we're at a 50% beta. It's kind of the assumptions we're using.  On the fee side, we feel pretty  growth on the fee side. We had momentum there. We had a tremendous year in 2021. We still think we'll continue to have pretty good pull through of revenue, with the exception of mortgage just because of lower spreads and volumes. William Rogers Jr.: John, the simplest way to think about it is the 2% sort of assumes a flattish kind of NII. And the upside of the 2% to 4% is in the NII. And then the balance of the growth is non-interest income. John Pancari : Separately, on the loan growth. side, I wonder if you can give us just expectations how we should think about the pace of growth in 2022 and maybe also for that as well how that would break down in terms of commercial versus consumer trends. William Rogers Jr.: John, maybe I'll do a little sort of where we are and what the jumping off point is to put a little put a little context around that. As you well know, loan growth is a function of production utilization, pay downs, and pipelines is the way that I like to think about the about the formula in its most simple way. And as we finished the fourth quarter, we really saw the production start to increase, utilization was up about 2.5 points, which was \u2013 that's the first time we've seen a swing in the utilization front. And that was pretty universal. So, we felt good about that from a momentum standpoint. Paydowns were up a little bit, but maybe most importantly, is the pipelines were at really, really high levels. So, our CCB pipeline, our CIB pipeline and our CRE pipelines all were at historically sort of high levels compared to the quarter and compared to this time last year. Usually, this time of year, you're starting to clean out pipelines and sort of trying to refresh in the first quarter. So, we enter this with a little more confidence and momentum than maybe we have in the past. On the consumer side, we have some headwinds from student loan, but that was really just left purchases available. So, I think that's sort of a little bit of a conscious kind of decision. And then home equity, which I think just is a symbol of sort of how people want to borrow in the future, but remember, things like service finance are coming on. So, we completed that purchase in early December. So we'll sort of get the benefit of that on the consumer side as we come through.  So, in terms of thinking about the whole year and thinking about puts and takes, I think sort of a mid-single digit from here kind of growth rate based upon everything we know now, nothing else changing, so on and so forth, I think is sort of eminently achievable, and I think reflective of the momentum we have right now. Operator : We have Ken Usdin with Jefferies back in the queue. Ken Usdin : Just wanted to come back on that expense trajectory and how you kind of take us from here to there. I heard the points about the 1% to 2% underlying growth off the end of the year. But you still said you're on track to get the full cost saves? Can you kind of talk us through, after the conversion, when do you get to that run rate numbers? Is it still the fourth quarter? And any update that you might have in terms of just that gross versus net and if you're doing any better on either side versus your original expectations. Daryl Bible : Ken, as I said before, our trajectory on expenses is not just down every quarter, it moves up and down. Obviously, we've got some seasonal factors going from fourth to first with FICA and 401(k). And then, we are building our marketing budget and basically rolling out our Truist brand across the whole footprint pretty aggressively to build brand awareness.  I think as the quarter and years play out, I think you're going to see expenses maybe pick up a little bit. And then,. as we get through all the technology decommissioning, that's probably the biggest cost saves to still come through. That's really back end loaded right now. We still have 400 branches that will go away early in the quarter. But for the most part, other real estate and technology savings are probably the biggest savings, which will be towards the end of the quarter. And we feel really good about still hitting our target that we originally set when we announced the merger. William Rogers Jr.: One other point I'd add. I think Daryl was making this earlier. This also covers the investments that we're making. So, we have this unique opportunity, in that we've got cost saves out of us, but the ability to cover not only the inflation pressures, but also our investments in talent, our investment in technology, the ability to grow our businesses, that's all factored into this guidance. Daryl Bible : If you look at the investments we're making this quarter versus last year, it's probably double what it was. So, we're actually investing more in the company and still achieving our cost saves. Ken Usdin : Just a second question. You talked about insurance being better this year. The Jan 1 renewals were 10%, 11%. I'm just wondering if you can help us understand what the growth outlook is for the insurance business given the mid-year acquisitions you had in addition to the organic growth outlook. William Rogers Jr.: Ken, if it's okay, I'm going to let John sort of hit that directly. John Howard : I'd say that the environment for insurance continues to be favorable. So, when you think about it from a pricing standpoint, you mentioned the Jan 1 renewals, those were largely around reinsurance pricing and they vary by class of business, but it remains a favorable environment for insurance pricing. We continue to see exposure growth. We continue to see very strong statistics in new business and retention. So, we expect strong performance in insurance in 2022. Operator : We'll now hear from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Can you guys share with us \u2013 obviously, your CET1 ratio, you lowered the near-term targeted ratio to 9.75% from 10%. What is the longer term once the integration is completed, we're in 2023, heading out further. What do you guys think is a long-term CET1 ratio for you folks? Daryl Bible : Gerard, I think as we've said before, we're going to continue to look at sort of where we are in our merger integration, where the economy is, the health of our business and make those adjustments on an ongoing basis. And this won't be a quarterly kind of thing, but just as we see significant shifts in those criteria, evidenced by the fact we went from 10% to 9.75%, and also the fact we've got flexibility. The good news was we had loan growth at the end of the quarter that probably exceeded our expectations and that took our CET1 a little below that target, which we think is great. By the way, that's the sort of high class way to go below that target.  So, as we go through the process this year, we go through the CCAR process, look at all the stress testing results, I think sometimes toward the middle or the end part of this year, we'll take another harder look and be more communicative about where another goal might be. Gerard Cassidy : As a follow up, I'm trying to figure out, on the fourth quarter of call for 2022 next January, what's going to be the real subject of discussions for you folks and maybe your peers? Obviously, we're not going to be talking about restructuring costs and things like that because it will be finally over for you, folks. But credit is something that I'm wondering about because it's so good today. We all know that. And I don't know if Clarke can comment on this, but I'm curious, when you look at your underwriting standards today \u2013 I don't know if you want to use a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being very conservative, 1 being very aggressive \u2013 where does it stand versus where it was at the start of the pandemic? And then where it was versus 2019?  And then second, what's going on with your competition? Are they being really aggressive? Are you guys seem really aggressive underwriting from some of your peers? Clarke Starnes III : I would say, for Truist, we've removed all our COVID-related overlays that we added in from an underwriting standpoint as the pandemic hit. So, I would say we are underwriting more or less at a normal through the cycle rate. So, right in the middle of the field. We're not on the aggressive and we're not on the conservative end. I think we're meeting the market through our long-term approach. Obviously, it's very competitive out there. There are aggressive structures and pricing considerations that we have to deal with every day. But I think our view is that, because of our diverse business model, particularly in our lending segments, we can get responsible growth through the cycle approach. So, I would say for us, we're in a pretty normal approach, albeit watching those areas that might have been impacted structurally by the pandemic \u2013 CRE, office, things like that. But otherwise, for us, it's more normal underwriting. Operator : Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities has the next question. Mike Mayo : Just a specific question as relates to competition. What's been the retention rate of your employees, customers' deposits? When the merger was announced three years ago, there was a lot of talk about competitors gaining share. And I'm just wondering what specific metrics you have around that. William Rogers Jr.: I'll take a crack at that. Obviously, that's an extremely high focus area for us. If we start with deposit and client side, I would say it's been exceptional and exceeded our expectations. The branch closures, retention numbers have been really in the high, high 90s. I think it's just a reflection of clients' confidence in us, our presence in the market and our ability to handle their needs, whether it's digital or whether it's physical. So, that part has been exceptional, exceeded probably all expectations.  And the same thing we see it in the deposit growth. Those are hard numbers, look at market share, but I feel like we're taking share in that sense, in that retention model. As it moves to teammates, I think you and I have talked about this. Right into the first year of the merger, our retention numbers were actually higher for Truist compared to each heritage company. So our teammates had voted for the merger and wanting to be part of that. And we look at not only overall with retention, we look high performer retention. We divide it up a lot of different ways. Obviously, that attrition has picked up. And that's picked up across the industry. I still think on a relative basis, we look really strong from that standpoint.  And if you think about what's going to happen to us, we also changed the denominator a bit when we closed a lot of branches and we're still consolidating. So, our ability, I think, to stay ahead of the attrition game, I think we're really, really well positioned from that standpoint. But also, and maybe equally importantly, is our attractiveness to hire talent has never been better. We are bringing in some fantastic people that want to be part of our company. They've bought into our purpose. They love the idea of being on a strong legacy company that feels like a startup. So, it's got sort of a nice combination to it. Our commitment and capacity to innovate, make investments has been really attractive. So our attrition numbers are up. There's no doubt about that in the last year. Everybody else's is. I think on a relative basis, we're okay. We manage it to an absolute, though. That's the way I think about it. And our ability to attract talents, really, really strong. Never been stronger. Mike Mayo : As far as the follow-up, I'm going to have a wind up to my second question here. It's been almost three years since you announced the merger. Your stock is up 39%. The bank index is up 52%. The S&P is up 71%. So, you have woefully underperformed from a stock standpoint. And that coincides with a period when you've shown some negative operating leverage, especially last year. And you've talked about this, the pandemic slowed down the merger conversions, NII has been depressed, you've had a cautious approach, you want the best of breed. And so, we have all that. So, really, I'm getting to positive operating leverage this year, you're doubling the investment. But I just want to know if we can have additional reassurance that operating leverage will be more positive than, say, 1 basis point because you say 2% to 4% revenue growth, 1% to 2% expense growth. So that could be anywhere from 1 basis point to 300 basis points. And this merger was predicated on overlapping footprints, benefits of technology. It seems like you're spending a lot of the savings and investors aren't seeing that to the bottom line. So can you just give any assurance or maybe not as far as the positive operating leverage this year and the payback from these investments, while, as you say, that the hood is open? William Rogers Jr.: I think the commitment to positive operating leverage is clear in our guidance. Related to how much we achieved, I think given we've had a pretty conservative forecast on the rate increases, if we get additional rate increases, this was predicated \u2013 the 1% in your lineup was predicated on two rate increases. If we get more, those sort of follow straight through to the bottom line. So, we create more operating leverage.  But I also think, the point I made earlier, we're continuing to invest in this business. We're not going to achieve positive operating leverage and starve our business. The ability to achieve the cost saves, redeploy them into the appropriate investments for the long term, that was the vision of Truist. That was the premise upon which we established this merger.  And I think, arguably, and it'd be hard to dispute, it's taken a little bit longer. Some of those were decisions we made, the best of both was a little more expensive than we had anticipated at the outset. But I think you're really starting to see, and I can feel, you can feel it in the pivot in the fourth quarter, you can feel it in the pivot in our guidance, of the promise of Truist is manifesting itself in not only positive operating leverage, but purposeful growth and an ability to invest in the business for the long term.  So, yes, we're committed to positive operating leverage, underlined, exclamation point and all the other comments, but in a way that we're continuing to invest to grow our business for the long term. Daryl Bible : The only thing else I want to add to that, if you look at our net interest income, just to remind you, we have run off of purchase accounting accretion of about $400 million planned for year-over-year. And we have about $325 million run off of PPP planned to be lower year-over-year.  So, for us, just to be flat in NII, 6.5%, the guidance that we gave for revenue growth has net interest income being up maybe a little bit, maybe 1% on a GAAP basis, but that's really 8% if you look at the real true operations of the company and potentially up to maybe 10% if we get rate increases and maybe some more loan growth. So, the company is really performing at high levels from a production basis on the amount of volume that we're putting through on the asset side of the equation. Operator : We'll now hear from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. John McDonald : Bill, I wanted to ask you a little bit more of an industry question. With the loan demand and loan growth numbers looking better across the industry, what's happening in the psychology of the borrower here? Feels like there's still a lot of liquidity out there, but there's a change going on. Is it more competence about the economy? Folks just have run into a need to build inventories. Why are we seeing this increase in loan demand across the industry? William Rogers Jr.: I think it's a combination of things, John. When I'm out visiting with clients, demand is never the issue for business. They all have demand. And that cuts across actually a wide swath of industries and geographic locations. So, the ability to do business.  I think you're seeing a couple things. One is, I think what your premise was, and your question, people building a little inventory, sort of anticipating, trying to get ahead some of the supply chain, I think you see that. Then you just see stuff happening, like in the dealer side, cars are showing up on lots. They may be showing up on lots needing a chip, or whatever it may be, but they're showing up. So the ability to borrow against those capacities. And then, I think people are just making the decisions to move forward. Deploying capital, they've had plans. If they've delayed plans, they're continuing to look at the current Omicron as potentially a short term situation that reverses itself, and they don't want to get behind. They're all in competitive situations. So, I think they're deploying capital against the opportunities that they've had planned for the several years. So I think it's a combination of a lot of things, just resiliency of the economy and a little bit of positioning to get one step ahead of both supply chains, wage pressure, whatever it may be and the competition. John McDonald : Just follow-up for Daryl on the revenue outlook for this year. The first, how much of that $300 million impact from the Truist One and overdraft, how much of that gets felt in 2022, Daryl? And then also, just on the overall revenue guide, can you just give us the base for the 2021 revenues, that $22.5 billion or something like that for this year that you're growing 2% to 4% off of? Daryl Bible : I'll do your latter question first. So, the base for 2021 revenue is $22.3 billion, is kind of base I would grow off of. And then, for the Truist One, recall in Bill's remarks, it's probably going to start in the second quarter. And it's probably anywhere from a third to 40% of the impact would be in 2022 and probably spread out evenly over second, third and fourth quarter, and then kind of builds up in '23 and then the full run rate in '24 of $300 million. Operator : Next up, we have Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess I just wanted to follow-up, Daryl, on your comments around operating leverage. I think the promise of the deal partly was the benefit of scale. As we look beyond this year, just structurally, when we look at the efficiency ratio, I think about 55%, 56% right now, do you see the bank actually being a low 50s efficiency ratio franchise over the next two to four years? Or given the investment spend that you've talked about, it's going to be hard to make that move, absent meaningfully higher interest rate backdrop? Daryl Bible : It's a good question. And to the latter part of your question, there is some normalization of rate dependency to get to that lower efficiency ratio. And we won't make as much move on that in the next year, but our efficiency ratio on a relative basis, I think, will continue to be industry leading. So I think the ability to invest in our business, do it in a way that, to your points of scale, achieves a much more efficient company. I think we'll be able to continue that progress.  And then, if we get some sort of normalization of rates, I think looking out over a two and three year period, I think the low 50s is a reasonable target in a normalized kind of right environment. William Rogers Jr.: The thing I would add, Ebrahim, and what I said on Mike's call, the run-off of the purchase accounting accretion gets easier year after year. So, the ability to drive positive operating leverage will get easier as we go out two, three, four years. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess on the revenue side, with the systems conversion done, my sense would be, given your scale, given your history in these markets, you should be playing offense where you gain market share. So, Bill, you shared some retention numbers. But talk to us about your ability to go head to head with regionals, smaller banks, and actually gain market share, as we think about the next few years and probably outperform on loan growth. William Rogers Jr.: Maybe just to clarify the first part of your question, we've been on offense. I think it's just an ability to be further on offense and to accentuate that capability. If you look at virtually all of our categories, if you think about insurance, as an example, relative to insurance, if you think about our investment banking relative to investment banking, if you think about deposit growth, loan growth, client acquisition, digital adoption, whatever measures you want to choose on a relative basis, I feel like we're already gaining share. And I think, to your point, our capacity to gain share, our competitiveness, the breadth and depth of our product capability, the talent that we have on the field, the training that they're receiving, the way they work together and integrated relationship management, the way that they allow all cylinders of the company to benefit the client, we've just never been more competitive against small, against regional, against large. I think all the things that we wanted to see and feel from Truist are absolutely coming to bear on the field every day. Ankur Vyas : Jake, we've got time for one more question. Operator : And we will take that last question from Erika Najarian with UBS. Erika Najarian : I'll be quick. Daryl, your outlook for adjusted expense growth, I presume that's from the $12.687 billion base? And if so, what is the outlook for amortization expense in 2022, please? Daryl Bible : Yeah, so the base is correct. What you said was right, Erika. And then, if you look in our tables in the back of the appendix, we actually gave guidance around that out there. So you'll be able to easily kind of fill in your models with all that information. So, it'll make it easy for you. Erika Najarian : And the positive operating leverage guide, does that include the amortization? Daryl Bible : No, we always exclude amortization. It's in the footnote definition. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to your host for any additional or closing remarks. Ankur Vyas : That completes our earnings call. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to the IR team. Thank you all for your interest in Truist and attending our call. We hope you have a great day. Jake, you can now disconnect. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Truist Financial Corporation's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Ankur Vyas, Head of Investor Relations, Truist Financial Corporation. Ankur Vyas : Thank you, Katie, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist's first quarter 2022 earnings call. With us today are our Chairman and CEO, Bill Rogers; and our CFO, Daryl Bible. During this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's forwarder results and share their perspectives on how we continue to activate Truist's purpose, our progress on the merger and current business conditions. Clarke Starnes, our Chief Risk Officer; Beau Cummins, our Vice Chair; and John Howard, our Chief Insurance Officer, are also in attendance and are available to participate in the Q&A portion of the call. The accompanying presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the Truist IR website, ir.truist.com. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slide 2 and 3 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix for the appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. In addition, Truist is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized live and achieved webcasts are located on our website. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill. Bill Rogers : Thanks, Ankur, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call today. We delivered solid first quarter results, representing the diversity and flexibility of Truist in a more volatile market and business environment. Net interest income declined sequentially due to lower day count, lower PPP revenue and purchase accounting. Net interest margin slightly exceeded our expectations, and more importantly, both NII and NIM appear to have bottomed and have good upside from here. Fee income was below expectations, primarily due to investment banking and mortgage both of which were negatively impacted by the market environment. These effects were partially offset by higher insurance income, which underscores the advantages of our diverse business mix. Expenses were lower than expected, reflecting strong expense discipline and lower incentive compensation associated with softer fee income. We experienced continued solid loan growth, albeit with headwinds in certain areas. Credit quality remains excellent, contributing to another provision benefit. We also completed our largest conversion event in February. There is a palpable level of excitement from our teammates to go to market as One Truist with an expanded toolkit to better fulfill our purpose. We'll share more details on these topics during the presentation. First and foremost, we are guided by our purpose, which is to inspire and build better lives and communities. We're convinced that our purpose reinstates the foundation for our success as a company. Our purpose defines how we do business every day, and it provides a framework for how we make decisions. On Slide 5, we highlight some of the ways we're bringing purpose to life. A key area of focus for Truist is financial inclusion. We're wholly committed to removing barriers and improving access to the financial system for all communities, which is why I'm pleased that the Truist foundation is supporting nonprofits that serve women and minority-owned small businesses and advancing digital equity among historically underserved communities. We know people want to work for companies that stand for something meaningful and the combination of our purpose-driven culture with our industry-leading compensation and benefits, training, development and flexible approach to work is highly effective at attracting and retaining top talent. We plan to further strengthen our benefits programs by launching an employee stock purchase program later this year, subject to shareholder approval. We also implemented our Truist work model with a focus on intentional flexibility as our teammates return to on-site work throughout March. Personally, it was just incredibly energizing to have so much in-person engagement over the last two months whether with teammates, clients, community members or shareholders. Hybrid and more flexible works here to stay, but I'm pleased at how our team mates have embraced this new model. We're also doing our part to convert climate change. And in late January, announced our plans to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. We're externalizing our own net zero aspirations and furthering the transition to a low-carbon economy by adding new teammates in our CIB and Commercial Community Bank to help our clients make their own transition. Lastly, we completed our largest core bank conversion event in February. This was an enormous undertaking with that involved transitioning nearly 7 million clients to the Truist ecosystem and unveiling roughly 6,000 Truist signs across our footprint, which will further build our brand. The integration was successful overall, especially when you consider the scale and complexity involved. This was the largest bank technology integration in over 15 years. I want to personally thank our teammates for their hard work and preparation as well as the many personal sacrifices they've made to ensure the integration was successful. Because of you, we now have millions of Truist clients who are absolutely pleased with their experience. At the same time, it's also impossible to execute an integration of this magnitude perfectly. We acknowledge there were some opportunities to improve along the way. Our teams did an incredible job in resolving client challenges with urgency and a view towards long-term client and teammate experience improvements. My commitment, though, is that we will not rest until every client is satisfied. Coming to Slide 7. Our adjusted results exclude $166 million of after-tax merger-related and restructuring charges and $155 million of after-tax incremental operating expenses-related merger. We also generated a $57 million after-tax gain on redemption of a non-controlling equity interest related to the acquisition of certain merchant service relationships, which will provide Truist a larger share of the economics and more control over the end-to-end client experience. Finally, we incurred a $53 million after-tax loss to reposition approximately $3 billion of securities to enhance our yield by approximately 100 basis points. The total EPS impact of these items was $0.24 per share. Daryl will provide more details on these items later in the presentation. Turning to our first quarter performance highlights on Slide 8. We earned $1.3 billion or $0.99 a share on a reported basis. Excluding the selected items on Slide 7, adjusted earnings totaled $1.6 billion or $1.23 per share, up 4.2% compared to a year ago, primarily driven by lower loan loss provision. Compared to the fourth quarter, adjusted EPS declined 11% driven primarily by a 4% decrease in adjusted revenue attributed to more challenging market conditions and fee businesses such as investment banking and residential mortgage in addition to some normal seasonal patterns. Adjusted ROTCE was a strong 22.6%, unchanged from the prior two quarters. Even excluding the reserve release, adjusted ROTCE was still strong at 19.9%. Adjusted expenses decreased slightly as seasonal headwinds were offset by lower incentive compensation due to softer fee income in addition to our ongoing merger-related cost save efforts. While operating leverage was a negative 240 basis points year-over-year, we are still targeting positive operating leverage for the full year 2022. Asset quality continues to be excellent, and net charge-offs remain low, contributing to a provision benefit during the quarter. Capital deployment remained healthy in the first quarter as we completed the acquisition of Kensington Vanguard and certain merchant services relationships and funded solid organic loan growth. I'll provide more details about loan growth shortly. Overall, we're off to a slower start in 2022 than we would like, but I believe our performance can improve throughout the year. In addition to the core bank conversion, we completed the migration of our retail business and wealth clients to the new Truist digital experience and now have sunset all heritage digital experiences. As you'll recall, early in the merger, we made the decision to build a completely new digital experience rather than relying on existing systems and parties given the increasing importance of digital channels to our clients, we've built this new platform based directly on clients' feedback, and we've introduced it in waves, learning from each release and continually improving. With a more modern and agile platform and approach, we're able to introduce a number of new features to both sets of heritage clients in advance of the core bank conversion and our speed of client experience improvements will only accelerate in the coming months and quarters as our digital and technology teams shift their efforts from integration. A great example of this will be Truist Assist, which will be our new cloud-based self-service digital assistant that we'll introduce in the second quarter and will be accessible to all our clients 24/7 via various digital channels. Truist Assist will help clients execute basic tasks, schedules and provide insights and recommendations so they can have more control and confidence in their financial well-being. In addition, we're executing and investing in a number of other areas over the coming quarters to improve our clients and teammates digital experience, including, but not limited to, digital payments, digital on-boarding, enhanced authentication technology and expanding LightStream to include a new deposit product on a real-time cloud-based core. Turning to loans and leases on Slide 10. Average loan balances grew 0.8% sequentially and rose 1.2%, excluding PPP loans. Sequential loan growth was driven primarily by C&I which increased 5.1%, excluding PPP and mortgage warehouse lending, where balances have declined rapidly due to declines in refinance volumes. Loans grew across all CIB industry practice groups and growth was particularly strong within our Asset Finance group. Commercial Community Bank C&I loans grew 2.4%, excluding PPP, fairly broad-based across many of our regions. Revolver utilization and revolver exposure both grew in the quarter. CRE continues to be a headwind, given a very competitive market or optimistic that we're approaching stabilization. Excluding mortgage, consumer and card balances decreased 2%, driven primarily by a 3% decline in auto that was attributable to ongoing supply chain issues in a highly competitive environment. We also experienced continued declines in our home equity and student loan portfolios. These pressures were partly offset by service finance, which is performing well and off to a great start. This quarter, we were also excited to announce a new alliance with State Farm, whereby their agents will be able to offer consumer lending products through LightStream. We'll pilot this program later in the year and loan volumes will build over time. This alliance reflects Truist's increasing size, scale and relevance in addition to the superior digital capabilities and client experience that LightStream provides. In summary, we continue to be positive about the prospects for further loan growth in light of the current economic conditions in our pipelines, our increased capacity as a company to focus on clients post integration and our differentiated set of consumer businesses. At the same time, though, we've got to acknowledge the increased uncertainty presented by a range of geopolitical and economic risk, which could cause loan growth to deviate from our outlook. Now turning to deposits on Slide 11. Average deposit balances increased 1% during the first quarter, reflecting some moderation from the 2% pace observed in the fourth quarter. Total deposit costs were stable at 3 basis points. As interest rate environment involves, we'll take a balanced approach to managing deposits, being attentive to client needs and client relationships while maximizing value outside of rate paid. Guided by our purpose and our desire to be responsive to the needs of our clients, as previously announced, we'll discontinue a host of overdraft-related fees at the end of this month. We also remain on track to launch our new Truist One checking account experienced this summer, which will have zero overdraft fees, the capability to provide qualifying clients the liquidity they need to -- via a simple $100 negative balance buffer and a deposit-based credit line limit up to $750. We're mindful of the impacts that inflation and reduced stimulus may have on certain segments of our clients particularly the least advantaged and Truist One of the many examples of where we're advancing financial inclusion. Despite the financial impacts we've discussed previously, this is a long-term win for our stakeholders as we endeavor to improve retention, increase acquisition, and enhance the overall client experience. And with that, let me now turn it over to Daryl to review our financial performance in greater detail. Daryl Bible : Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 12. Net interest income decreased 2% sequentially as the impact of two fewer days and lower purchase accounting accretion offset the benefits of solid loan growth and higher securities yields. Reported net interest margin was flat and core net interest margin increased 2 basis points both exceeding our guidance by 2 basis points. The improvement in core net interest margin was primarily driven by lower premium amortization in the securities portfolio. Moving to Slide 13. Truist has intentionally maintained a balanced approach to managing interest rate risk, being well positioned to benefit from higher rates in the near-term while maintaining some level of downside protection if and when interest rates decline. We continue to be asset sensitive and estimate a 100 basis point ramp rate increase would increase NII by 4.3%, a 100 basis point shock would increase NII by 7.3%. Approximately 80% of our reported asset sensitivity is from the short end of the curve. While early, deposit betas thus far are tracking below modeled expectations. Moving to Slide 14. Adjusted revenue declined 4.4% linked quarter, which is below our guidance range of down 1% to 2% and driven almost entirely by weaker-than-expected fee income. Fees declined 8% sequentially and reflecting challenging market conditions and seasonality. Investment banking and trading income declined $116 million or 31% as more volatile market conditions impacted M&A, high yield, leverage finance and equity. Investment banking pipelines look healthy, but market conditions will determine both how much and when the pipeline is realized. Residential mortgage income declined $70 million or 44% as higher interest rates reduced refinance activity and pressured gain on sale margins on the production side. Servicing was not as large of an offset as expected since the benefits of slowing DK were eroded by higher hedging costs due to the flatter yield curve. Part and payment fees and service charges on deposits declined $33 million collectively primarily driven by seasonal but also due to client-friendly fee waivers we instituted in and around the time of our February conversion. These items were partially offset by insurance income, which increased 9% primarily due to strong organic growth and the first month of Kensington Vanguard acquisition. We included a table at the bottom of Slide 14 to make other income trends more clear. Other income, excluding changes in our nonqualified plan and other gains was up $31 million sequentially given negative valuation adjustment for Visa-related derivative last quarter and up $56 million year-over-year primarily as a result of higher SBIC income. Turning to Slide 15. Reported expenses were $3.7 billion, including $216 million of merger-related costs and $202 million of incremental operating expenses related to the merger. The merger costs in the quarter were primarily connected to new Truist signs, branch closings and impairments and data center decommissioning efforts. Adjusted expenses decreased sequentially, exceeding our guidance of up 1% to 2% and reflecting our disciplined expense management. The drivers of the decline include decreased personnel costs, reflecting lower incentive compensation expense and changes to the nonqualified plan, partially offset by seasonally higher FICA and 401(k) expenses. The decrease in personnel expense was partially offset by increased marketing costs as we continue building our brand. Compared to the first quarter of 2021, adjusted expenses were stable as cost saves from FTE reductions and lower occupancy costs were offset by continued investments in software and marketing, along with higher operational losses. The operational losses have steadily increased in recent quarters as banks are experiencing higher levels of fraud activity, in addition to our own decisions to enhance client experience. We remain highly focused on reducing our operational losses and improving our client experience at the same time. Overall, we have incurred significant costs in conjunction with the integration events, both in the merger categories as well as run rate fees and expenses. We were excited that our last major conversion event is behind us, and we can start to reduce the financial costs associated with these integrations. Moving to Slide 16. Asset quality remains excellent, reflecting our prudent risk culture, diverse portfolio and favorable economic conditions. Our net charge-off ratio for the first quarter was unchanged at 25 basis points. The ALLL ratio decreased to 1.44%, resulting in a provision benefit of $95 million first quarter. Our reserve levels reflect current credit conditions but also take into account uncertainty associated with inflation, rising rates and geopolitical events. Truist has no direct credit exposure to Russia or Ukraine and minimal indirect exposure. Including RAC, our exposure to subprime at the origination is 1% or less in the other consumer portfolios. Continuing on Slide 17. Capital and liquidity levels remain strong. Our CET1 ratio declined approximately 20 basis points as a result of capital deployments related to the acquisitions of Kensington Vanguard and certain merchant service relationships, growth in risk-weighted assets and the CECL phase-in. In order to mitigate ACI risk and volatility, we transferred approximately 40% of the securities portfolio to held to maturity during the first quarter. Because we are a Category 3 institution, AOCI does not impact regulatory capital, it simply impacts tangible common equity. We submitted our capital plan to the Federal Reserve in early April and look forward to sharing more details later this summer. Moving to Slide 18. This slide provides additional details about three transactions we completed in the first quarter to enhance our future earnings and profitability. First, Kensington Vanguard acquisition significantly expands our presence in title insurance, augments our capabilities in larger and more complex commercial transactions and will also provide additional IRM opportunities given our significant presence in CRE. We anticipate Kensington Vanguard will add $115 million in revenue annually and be accretive to insurance EBITDA margin by year two. Second, we terminated merchant revenue share alliance in which Truist had a non-controlling interest. The transaction resulted in a $74 million gain from marking our stake to fair value. In addition, we acquired significant portion of relationships from this alliance. This will position us to control more of the end client experience when serving those clients. We also believe that the acquisition will generate approximately $25 million of additional cash, PPNR annually. Last, we repositioned $3 billion of securities to enhance our yield by approximately 100 basis points resulting in a two-year payback. Moving to Slide 20. As Bill mentioned, we successfully completed our large core bank conversion in February. We are now One Truist, not just culturally, but also in terms of branding, digital and technology, which allows us to serve our clients more effectively and make our company simpler to operate. As we shift our focus from integration to executional excellence, we will maintain our focus on realizing remaining cost savings. Much of that will happen in the second half of '22 as we decommission over 900 business applications and three of our six data centers. Our decommissioning efforts are complex and significant, and we are on track. With our final integration largely complete, our technology teams will shift towards more further enhancing client and teammate experience. Turning to Slide 21. We have made excellent progress across the five cost-save buckets and are closing in on our commitment to achieve $1.6 billion in net cost saves. Third-party spend is down 11.9% from baseline levels exceeding our targeted reduction of 10%. This quarter, we closed over 400 branches exceeding our commitment to close over 800 total branches by the end of the first quarter of 2022. We now have finished the merger-related branch reduction efforts and will shift to more normal course branch network optimization. We have also achieved our targeted reduction in non-branch facility space, strategically reducing our occupancy costs through consolidation and closures. However, we still have more opportunities in which we are working. Excluding acquisitions average FTEs are down 1% linked quarter and 14% since the merger. Our voluntary separation and retirement program will conclude in the next two quarters, further supporting our ongoing cost saving efforts. I will now provide guidance for the full year '22 and new guidance for the second quarter. In 2022, we now expect adjusted revenue growth of 3% to 4% from 2021. Relative to our outlook from January, the mix of revenue growth is now tilted more towards net interest income given the outlook for higher short-term interest rates, partially offset by weaker fees, primarily in residential mortgage and investment banking. This represents 6% to 7% core revenue growth when you exclude significant decline in PPP and purchase accounting. As you will recall, we expect a mid-single-digit decline in service charges in 2022 given our elimination of certain overdraft-related fees and introduction of Truist One Banking. NII and net interest margin bottomed in the first quarter and should increase throughout the year based on the forward curve. We continue to expect point-to-point loan growth ex-PPP in the mid-single digits. But as Bill said, we acknowledge higher levels of economic uncertainty. We will be at the high end of our 1% to 2% increase of adjusted noninterest expense largely due to the impact of Kensington Vanguard acquisition. The first quarter was the peak for our merger-related costs, and now we are projecting less than $400 million for the rest of this year and none in 2023. We are still targeting positive operating leverage on a GAAP and adjusted basis in 2022, though this is somewhat dependent on interest rates and market conditions. We still expect net charge-off ratio to be in the 30 to 40 basis points given our assumptions for normalization throughout the year. Looking into the second quarter, we expect adjusted PPNR to grow high single digit with possible upside from the first quarter level. As a result, higher net interest income and much longer fee income given seasonality in insurance and the potential rebound of investment banking, this outlook assumes the forward curve in interest rates and controlled deposit betas. We expect core net interest margin to increase approximately 7 to 10 basis points due to the benefits from the March hike and from a projected 50 basis point hike in May. GAAP net interest margin is expected to increase only 3 to 4 basis points as purchase accounting accretion is slowing, given lower prepayment environment as a result of higher rates. Now I'll turn it back to Bill to conclude. Bill Rogers : Thanks, Daryl. Moving to Slide 22. The first quarter of 2022 was historic for Truist as we're now serving our clients as a true unified Truist across all dimensions. In addition, the first quarter is a strategic and financial turning point for Truist. Strategically, the completion of our core bank conversion positions us to fully shift our focused executional excellence, transformation and growth. Our businesses that went through earlier conversions in 2021 such as wealth and mortgage are beginning to see the benefits of this shift whether in the form of new adviser hiring in wealth or significantly improve client satisfaction scores and mortgage. Financially, the first quarter should be at the bottom for net interest income and net interest margin and fee performance should improve as market conditions normalize and we capitalize on the significant integrated relationship management and revenue synergy potential we have as a company. In addition, the completion of the integration means merger costs will decrease dramatically through the remainder of 2022 and we'll realize our remaining cost saves as data centers and systems are decommissioned in the back half of the year, all of which helped drive positive operating leverage. To conclude, I remain highly optimistic about the potential and opportunity for Truist, all of which are clearly summarized on Slide 23, our investment thesis. Our opportunity and priorities are clear : shift from an integration focus to execution focus, deliver better client experiences, capture the significant IRM and revenue synergy potential we have to shift the millions of hours of development training and effort from the integration to building better lives for our clients. This shift does not require any incremental risk appetite or capital. It only requires execution and focus. At the same time, while we believe the economy is on sound footing in the near term, the headwinds of geopolitical uncertainty, coupled with the inflationary environment and aggressive forecast for the tightening of monetary policy create a wide range of economic outlook as we move further into this year and next. Truist is well positioned across all of these environments, given our advice-oriented model for our clients, balanced approach to interest rate risk management, conservative credit culture, diverse business mix and strong and improving earnings profile. And with that, Ankur, let me turn it back over to you. Ankur Vyas : Thanks, Bill. Katie, at this time, will you explain to our participants how they can participate in the Q&A session? As you do that, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary question and one follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Bill, can you elaborate or Daryl as well, I guess, on the loan growth that you guys are seeing, I think, Bill, you touched on some very competitive forces in the commercial real estate markets. And what are you guys seeing in that area? And then on the residential mortgage business, Daryl, I think you referenced that the refinancing business was down. What percentage of originations are refinancing in the home mortgage business? Daryl Bible : Gerard, let me start on the loan growth and maybe sort of cover a variety of different topics in your question. We're seeing interesting loan growth and I think the places that most highly correlate to performance, I think, is where we're performing well. So, I think C&I as an example. So in C&I, if you exclude PPP, where remember, we were over-indexed appropriately, you exclude the mortgage warehouse component, which has a lot of seasonal components to it, it sort of dissected to core C&I, it was up about a little over 5%. So we think that actually reflects the core component of where we see loan growth and the power and the execution of our franchise. That was particularly strong and literally across all of our business lines that was good across virtually all of our geographies areas like asset finance and ABL, sort of geared supply chain were particularly strong. You asked about CRE, and I'd say it's a couple of different stories. On the small CRE side, we have had some runoff. Some of that's been intentional in the focused areas. On the sort of higher-end institutional borrowers, we actually performed very well. We've been very competitive on the residential and industrial side, particularly think specialized areas like data centers and those types of those types of things. Clients are flying portfolios. But it is an aggressive market. So I think the places where we want to be competitive, we're really competitive in the areas that we've allowed a little runoff, we've allowed a little runoff to happen there. Daryl, do you want to talk specifically about -- I think there was a question about the refi? Daryl Bible : Yes. On the residential, Gerard, about two-thirds of our activity was in refinance activity. That has really come down significantly. As we move to the second quarter, it's more of a purchase market kind of plays to our strength from that perspective. So I think we're hopeful that, that will kind of maintain and hopefully build as the year goes on, but refi is definitely being impacted. The other impact on the residential mortgage is just the cost of hedging is just a lot higher right now. So, it's offsetting some of the servicing benefit that you would get out there. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then as a follow-up, Bill, Truist has a unique franchise where you've got your regional precedence throughout your franchise, so you have a good pulse on what's going on in those markets. Can you give us an update on what your customers are telling you? Obviously, we're in a very uncertain time with the tragedy going on over in Ukraine. What are they feeling? And are they still pretty optimistic about their business outlook? Bill Rogers : Yes. Maybe I'll do it in two ways, and maybe I'll do it in -- starting with the tangible side. If you look at production and pipeline specifically, they're really strong. Our pipelines particularly in that core commercial business, which you're talking about in the first quarter are equal to where they were in the fourth quarter in terms of strength. So in terms of the evidence of what we see in terms of pipelines and production, I'd say there still is a great deal of confidence. Virtually every client is in some inventory build capacity. I mean from a supply chain perspective, they're all wishing to increase their inventory to serve an increasing demand. Demand does not seem to be the particular challenge. So I'd say that's the tangible part. Now the intangible part in talking to clients, sort of where everybody is and what some of the anecdotal evidence, I don't think we're in a full risk-off mode, but there's a little bit of a wait and see. I mean, I think that's fair. Maybe a little bit of a blinking yellow light, not a red light, nobody's stopping. So I think the combination of this tangible part that we see in terms of pipeline production, need for inventory build is really solid and would be reasons to be really optimistic all with just a little bit of a cautionary note as people look forward into the next several quarters. Daryl Bible : The only thing I would add to that, on the consumer side, it's fair to say in February during the conversion our branch people were really distracted just going through the integration and the efforts. I think we've come out of that strong now, and we're starting to see momentum in loan origination out of the branch areas. And if you look at our consumer convenience businesses that we have like LightStream and Sheffield and Service Finance, they're all starting off really strong and seeing really good volumes as we enter into the second quarter. Bill Rogers : Yes. So I think to bump those comments, I mean, there's reason to have a lot of optimism with just a slight level of uncertainty, which sort of is the right balance. Operator : We'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : One question on just the outlook here for how we should be thinking about net interest margin. And part of the reason I ask is when I'm looking at the average balances where you show what the yields did Q-on-Q. We have some declines in consumer loans. So I'm just wondering, is that like swap related or is there something more intimate going on in the portfolio? I'm just wondering how quickly that should bounce back given the outlook for rates that you've got? Daryl Bible : Yes, Betsy, I think what you're looking at, we can maybe check off the line, but I think it's just the runoff of purchase accounting. When you look at our new rates going on the books, our new volume rates are going on higher than what the existing portfolio is right now. So, we are averaging up in most cases across the board there. So, I think overall, yields will rise and when we have our projections throughout the year, I expect net interest margin to continue to rise throughout the year, NII to continue to grow just as the interest rates start to climb. Betsy Graseck : And then just to follow on there is. How do you think about your deposit strategy? How interested are you going to be in generating accelerating deposit growth? Or would you be more in the mode of allowing runoff? Just trying to understand the balance sheet size and how we should think through that. Daryl Bible : If you look at what we've attracted from COVID, $80-plus billion of new deposit funding, the vast majority of that is noninterest-bearing. And when you look at it, we pay the lowest rates of anybody else in the industry. So almost all of it is non-rate sensitive. So we definitely feel that we have betas modeled in to protect what we want to protect out there. There could be a little bit of ebb and flow. But for the most part, we will be specific to make sure that we protect our good clients throughout the organization and do that. But right now, we've had rates just started to lift off and our deposit betas that we're seeing right now are coming in much less than what we modeled. It's very early into this. But I think right now, I think it's not a huge impact on what we've had to pay and we still have the deposits growing for us, so non-interest-bearing growth from us in this past quarter as well. Bill Rogers : And that's what I might add to that, we're operating now as a new Truist. So we're operating with a company that has about an 18% average market share. So in number one, two or three market share in most of our markets. So that's a new experience. Also this increased capacity and marketing expense. So our unaided brand awareness has really gone up actually fairly significantly since the rollout. And then we just have a lot more capabilities other than rate pay. I mean we just have a lot more tools and capabilities to offer our clients. So, we're operating in the kind of -- this is the kind of environment we built through Truist forward in fairness. We have company that's got that kind of prowess and capability to serve our clients in ways other than just rate paid. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : I wanted to ask about the securities portfolio and the repositioning you did this quarter. So can you just talk a little bit about just where do you want that portfolio size to sit? And is the changes that you made, the sales and the repurchases in the forward outlook for NII? Daryl Bible : Yes. So I think the way we are managing the balance sheet, and we've talked about this before is, right now, we are targeting $15 billion to $20 billion of balances at the Fed. Since the war started in the first quarter, we're tilted a little bit towards the heavier side of that just for liquidity purposes. And you really look at the cash flows of the whole balance sheet in total. So we've had deposit growth come in, so that's a positive inflow. You have runoff of securities. That's a positive inflow. Our first priority is to lend it out to our clients and to basically do that. Once we've done what we can do from a lending perspective, then the residual piece would basically go into the securities portfolio. Now from a securities portfolio perspective, we're investing in the past in treasuries, MBS. So, those are very high-grade, very secure-type securities. Ken Usdin : Okay. And then the repositioning that you did this quarter, I assume that, that's built into the outlook. And I guess, is that generally where you're purchasing now? You've mentioned in the slide deck 3.2, is that where the front book is from here? Daryl Bible : So yes, the mix of what you're doing, if you go into treasuries, it isn't a forecast, Treasuries are in the 270s, 280s between the three- to five-year area. MBS are approaching 4%. So, it'll blend there. But I would say, we'd be on the shorter end of that on a duration perspective, but all that is incorporated with the guidance we gave you. Operator : We'll take our next question from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. John McDonald : I just want to follow up on Ken's question. Just more broadly, how are you guys thinking about managing capital? On the regulatory side, you're still well above your regulatory minimums with the 9.4% CET1, but a little bit below where you usually target how you're thinking about that? And then on the GAAP side, how are you thinking about managing against further OCI risks as keep going up potentially? Bill Rogers : Hey, John, it's Bill. Why don't I maybe start on the capital side? I mean, I think we've been very consistent about thinking about where we wanted to establish capital, where we want to operate based on three primary factors. One was just where we were in the merger, how much risk do we have on the merger, do we need to allow additional capital for merger risk. That's obviously come down substantially. I mean, I would consider that sort of be in a normal mode right now, and we don't -- we've gotten through the big components of that really, really successfully. The second is how much economic risk do we have? And we probably have a little more economic risk in fairness than we had a year ago, but I think maybe on the marginal side. And then sort of where we fit from risk profile as evidenced by some of the CCAR results. And I think will be another confirmation of our lower risk profile, higher PPNR model as Truist. So, those are the three things that we put into the mixing bowl as it relates to capital. And we'll continue to reevaluate that. We feel very comfortable where we are right now. We'll reevaluate that in the mid part of this year and try to determine the appropriate place for Truist to operate. But I feel like we've got a lot of opportunity in the capital side based on the evaluation of those risks. And Daryl, would you answer the other part of that question. Daryl Bible : Yes. So on the OCI, John, what I would tell you is Category 3 it's not in our regulatory capital numbers. 99% of our portfolio is guaranteed. So it's just a matter of timing. We're going to get the funding back. It's not a permanent impairment that you see. There are partial offsets once a year you mark your pension plan that Mark will obviously be against what the OCI is, which would be some benefit at 12/31. But the real hedge when you really look at this is the economic hedge with deposits. I mean deposits have increased in value. We don't mark to market these non-maturity deposits, but we really look at it. The value of that has well exceeded the adjustment than what you saw on the securities portfolio. So that's really, I think, the offset that you see there. If we wanted to, we could put more than 40% into held to maturity, I don't think we're there yet where we need to do that from that perspective. I think we feel good with what we've done today. John McDonald : Okay. And then one nitpick as a follow-up, Daryl, the duration of the AFS portfolio before the transfers, I think it was about $5 million, do you have the new number on what that looks like now after you've moved some to held to maturity? Daryl Bible : About 6.5%, and our modeling, even with rates going up higher is basically capped out. So, we're really in the six handle, and that's where it's going to be until rates start to fall again. John McDonald : 6.5% now. Operator : We'll take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Sorry if I missed that earlier, but did you say how much of the $1.6 billion of cost saves you're looking to achieve by year end in the 1Q run rate? Daryl Bible : Yes. Matt, what I would say, it's pretty minimal. I mean we had a little bit more reduction in VSRP at the beginning of the quarter. Most of the branch closures were back-end loaded in the quarter. Some of the technology savings that's going to come through that's really all in the second half. We have a little bit more closures in corporate real estate. So, I would say, it's much more back-end loaded. We maybe got a little bit, but the vast majority of it would be in the second half of '22. Matt O'Connor: Okay. When you say a little bit, meaning a little bit more than last quarter, right? Because you already had at least a chunk of the 1.6 in the run rate at year-end, right? Daryl Bible : That's right. Yes. So, we were two-thirds of the way through at the end of the year. We made a little bit of progress in the first quarter, and we got more to do in the second half of '22. Bill Rogers : Yes. I'd say, Matt, I mean -- yes, Matt, we're on really good track on the cost saves. I mean, we're ahead in most of the categories where we want to be. And now we've got a couple of remaining big chunky ones and they're binary. You close the data center and you get the cost saves. I mean, so we feel really good about where we are in that trajectory. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then more broadly speaking, like as we think about costs beyond this year, how do you think about -- how should we think about what Truist is trying to be? Like is this a kind of key growth low? Is it an operating leverage story? Because obviously, there's been lots of puts and takes with the merger. We also have inflation. We also have revenue benefiting from rates, which is usually a very good efficiency business. But what is Truist from an expense perspective looking out beyond this year? Bill Rogers : Yes. I think, Matt, if we think about sort of overall for Truist, what we expect to be a low efficiency ratio company. So I think the construct of our business mix and our structure allows us to be a low-efficiency industry-leading low efficiency ratio company, sort of where that ends on an absolute basis will depend on a lot of market conditions, but we'll be at the low end of that. We will be a company with higher growth potential and less volatility. So I mean when we think about how expenses fit into that rather than sort of the absolute dollar amount in light of expenses that support a growing business and being able to do that with, I think, an industry-leading low efficiency ratio. And positive operating leverage. And maybe I showed you asked that I want to make sure I make that clear as well. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Just first, just a clarification. So you've guided revenue growth for this year from 2% to 4% up to 3% to 4%, and you expect $500 million of merger savings by year-end from this point forward. Is that correct? Daryl Bible : Roughly, I would say $400 million to $500 million, Mike, because we got a little bit of savings in the first quarter. Mike Mayo : Okay. And then more generally, Bill, you just talked about your terminal and state superior growth, superior efficiency, and I would -- from what you said before, you have superior geographies superior business mix, superior levers with the merger model. So superior, but then you look at the current loan growth and its average the current deposit growth, its average operating leverage this year looks average. So superior features, but average results, I know you're going from integration to kind of execution. But from our standpoint, it looks like you're in a corvette going 60 miles per hour. So when will this superior positioning lead to superior growth? Bill Rogers : Okay. We're going to assume we're on the auto bot. We have no speed limits in terms of opportunity. And Mike, we're at that inflection point. I mean we talked about this. This is -- I think we're right at that pivot point. And I can feel it. I mean I can feel all the things if you categorize loan growth. But if we break it down to, I think, the things that are highly correlated to positive trajectory, I think those areas where actually we're doing well, things like sort of core C&I. Other decisions on loan growth are related to the decisions we've made about positioning our company, which I think will be really beneficial to us long term. And then I look at sort of the pivot points of, I mean, I'll pick several categories if I look at integrated relationship management. It wasn't at the level we needed it to be in sort of the fourth quarter, first quarter, we've made the pivot point, and we're starting to see significant increase, and you'll start to see that in some of our results. You see that a little bit in the insurance results in this quarter where we are in terms of positive asset flow and wealth, wealth teams and insurance teams net positive in terms of adding people. So we've reached sort of really good inflection points there. Investment banking, clearly, in terms of adding, retaining opportunities in those businesses, things like the core commercial pipelines, where we are in terms of more lead deals more on the left side, where we are positioned in terms of production in the places we want to be. So I can feel the inflection point. So maybe we're -- whatever it was 60 miles an hour, but the foot is on the accelerator, not the brake. And I totally feel that in the transition that we're making at this particular juncture, and I'm very confident about our positioning for the future. Mike Mayo : Maybe just one follow-up. What percentage of your time was spent on the merger before and how much of it has been on continued integration now? Bill Rogers : Jeff, I look at my personal calendar, I don't think I've been in Charlotte in the last five weeks or so. I mean, so I look at all of our leaders' time in terms of where they're spending time, and there's a significant difference. I've been much more in front of teammates, in front of clients and community. And just my own personal time, I can feel it. And in fairness, I'm just one symbol. More teammates have been in that mode for a longer period of time than I have, and we feel that power shift. I mean just thinking about it in a simple way and Daryl was talking about it in a simple way, we did about 0.5 million hours worth of training. So just maybe put that in context of which that 0.5 million hours of training, we now translate into 0.5 million hours of client-related activity just as like one symbol. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : On the efficiency, the medium-term efficiency goal of the low 50s, I just want to get a little bit more color from me in terms of what exactly would you say is needed to get there in terms of the rate backdrop? And then also in terms of timing that you see as reasonable to get to that low 50s range? Daryl Bible : Yes, John, you kind of go back where we were when we announced this transaction back in '19. Rates were a couple of hundred basis points higher back then. And at that point, we thought if we got those cost saves, we would be able to come in at the low 50s at that point. We're definitely a different company. We continue to buy and add businesses and all that. But we definitely have at least a forecast from the Fed for it to go up a couple basis points this year and into 2023. So assuming you get the Fed up to 3%, 3.5% and we will execute on our cost saves, we should have really strong efficiency ratios coming in. Whether we get low 50s or not, I think there's a shot that that could happen just because of the asset sensitivity that we have in the Company and what we're seeing in the marketplace, our deposit beta is how they perform. So no guarantees from that perspective, but rates going up definitely helps on the net interest income side significantly, and it's back to kind of where we were back in '19. John Pancari : Okay. And then also on the expense side, your expectation for the $492 million in incremental expenses related to the merger to roll off in 2023. What are the biggest drivers of that decline? I know you mentioned the consolidation of data centers. Like if you could just give us a little more granularity around what are the biggest components. And related to that, I know you indicated you completed your core conversion. Regarding the core deposit system, what was the upgrade there? What did you move to? Daryl Bible : Yes. So from a cost save perspective, obviously, technology is the biggest chunk of where the cost savings would come in. So that would be the majority of the savings, both data centers, application systems, FTEs, all in that area would basically will be cost savings. We still have more to do on -- a little bit on the VSRP that will help benefit. You have more on corporate real estate reductions. So, we have other savings. So I would say overall, now that we've moved from the integration to now running and operating the Company, we will continue to look for more efficiencies as we operate the Company to give us more fuel to make more investments in the Company as we move forward from that perspective. And I'll put it back to Bill. Bill Rogers : Yes. And then on the core conversion, I mean, we consolidated to our heritage core platform but that doesn't really sort of explain the next-gen opportunities we have within that. So you think about the use of cloud-based and API technologies to create, for example, the digital experience, which we've talked about. So this concept of a digital straddle, we were able to convert add flexibility and add products and capabilities to our clients digitally long before we converted them physically in the core conversion. So I think we've got a really good strong first second-gen core platform with third gen, fourth gen kind of capabilities that sit on top of that. And then as you know, we're also experimenting with a new core platform for LightStream. So, I think we've got our feet in the right place where we want to be in terms of maximum flexibility listing core and experimenting with a new core with LightStream and a product called FinSac, which we've talked about before. And this digital straddle agility I think will really, really pay strong dividends for us going forward. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Just wanted to touch base on credit. One, Bill, Daryl, if you can just talk to us about the consumer book be it Sheffield, LightStream, anything in particular that you are watching around consumer trends, just a fair amount of concern around credit quality. And I'm not sure, if you can give any breakdown in terms of FICO scores within that consumer book? Bill Rogers : Yes. Clarke, do you mind you talk about... Clarke Starnes : Yes, Ebrahim, what I would say is that the area we're most focused on from the consumer standpoint around of more path to normalization or any potential stress out there with the inflationary pressures would be in our subprime auto book. Remember, that book is less than $5 billion to high return business. So, we are watching that really closely. And so, we're seeing the credit performance more normalized there. I would say, for the remaining consumer segments, we principally have a prime-based portfolio. So, less than 1% or so of our borrowers in those segments would be considered non-prime, so it's just not as big of an issue there, but I would say our expectations are that you'll continue to see as we go through the rest of the year. More normalization on the consumer side first and where we're watching most closely would be the lower income consumer in our subprime auto. Ebrahim Poonawala : That's helpful. And just as a follow-up to that, when we look at the reserve ratio at 144, just give us a context of a day one CECL and where you expect to bottom out, given sort of the macro uncertainties Bill and Daryl talked about. Clarke Starnes : Sure. And just to remind you all, our day one CECL was at 154 and at Q2 level now is at 144. So it's down 9 bps from the first quarter. And so, the other point I would make to you is our reserve coverage is even at that level, are very strong to NCOs and NPAs. So, the way we think about CECL, we continue to incorporate multiple economic scenarios and the estimate, including maintaining a pretty healthy weighting on our downside case. We also, this quarter, considered qualitatively in precision and uncertainty with respect to inflationary pressures, rate increases in the war in Ukraine. But remind you, I'd also reflected the outstanding performance we had from a risk profile and a credit performance for the quarter. So all that being said, we still anticipate potentially additional reserves in '22, but probably at a decelerated pace compared to last year. And I would just say this, obviously, the number and the amount of the releases is really dependent upon how the economic situation unfolds. Katie, we have time for one more question. Operator : We'll take our final question from Erika Najarian with UBS. Erika Najarian : Just one clarification question for me. Underneath your revenue guide of 3% to 4%, is it fair for us to assume that given the outlook for Fed funds for the rest of the year, we should take that 7.2% in the up 200 ramp scenario from Slide 13 as sort of maybe the starter point for the NII growth for 2022. And maybe take 80% of that to up 5.8%, then later on how we're thinking about loan growth and the long end of the curve? Daryl Bible : Yes. So a lot of moving parts there. What I would say is that in spirit, I think using a good gauge with a gradual over 200, I think is a good approximation. The deposit betas we talked about earlier, we have those being phased in and that's built into these numbers. So, we're expecting 25% the first 100, 35 and the next 150 after that. Right now, we're performing better than that. But we definitely have a pickup in trajectory. If this forward curve does play out as what's embedded in there you will see a big increase in both core net interest margins from where we are today, probably peers seen 3% maybe by the end of the year. Erika Najarian : Got it. So the follow-up here is, given what you've baked into the deposit betas in the first 100, which could be very minimal. The 7.2% in the up 200 could be the floor in terms of this year? Daryl Bible : I think we have good conservative estimates. So, there is a chance for outperformance, but it's still very early, Erika. So you don't really know. But I feel pretty good with these projections and feel good. Bill talked about earlier about our deposit base and our clients and density that we have. So, I think we're going to have really positive net interest income as this year plays out in the '23. Ankur Vyas : Okay. Thanks, everyone. This completes our earnings call.

Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Ankur Vyas, Head of Investor Relations, Truist Financial Corporation. Ankur Vyas : Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist's second quarter 2022 earnings call. With us today are our Chairman and CEO, Bill Rogers; and our CFO, Daryl Bible. During this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's second quarter results and share their perspective on our efforts to transition from an integration focus to an operating focus, current business conditions and our continued activation of Truist's purpose. Clarke Starnes, our Chief Risk Officer; Beau Cummins, our Vice Chair; and John Howard, our Chief Insurance Officer, are also in attendance and are available to participate in the Q&A portion of the call. The accompanying presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the Truist Investor Relations website, ir.truist.com.

In addition, Truist is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized live and archived webcast are located on our website. With that, I'll now turn it over to Bill. Bill Rogers : Thanks, Ankur. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call this morning. Trust delivered a good second quarter, reflecting our improving momentum after the integration and the resiliency of our diverse business mix in a volatile market environment. Our financial results modestly exceeded the guidance we provided in April with several puts and takes. Loan growth was strong and broad-based. Net interest margin expanded significantly due to higher interest rates in our strong deposit franchise. Credit quality remains excellent and we are pleased by our relative and absolute performance in the recent stress test. In light of these results, our Board will consider a resolution to increase the common dividend by 8% at its July meeting. This quarter's performance, combined with improving client experience trends and dramatically lower merger costs, reflects the initial benefits of our shift from integrating to operating. While there's still work to do, such as stemming elevated operational losses, closing out residual integration issues and completing our decommissioning process, I am very confident in Truist's trajectory and reaffirm our commitment to delivering positive operating leverage for the full year of 2022. I'm going to share some more details on those topics in a moment. Then going to Slide 4. As you all know, Truist is fundamentally a deep, purpose-led company dedicated to inspire and build better lives and communities. We know that our purpose-driven culture is the foundation for our success as a company. Our purpose drives performance and defines how we do business every day. It very intentionally begins with the word Inspire, and to be inspirational, it's often necessary to be bold and to be first. I'll highlight four examples that I think reflect that purpose on the next slide. First and foremost, we recently announced that we're making a significant investment in our teammates by raising our minimum wage to $22 an hour effective October 1. This increase will benefit approximately 14,000 teammates, about 80% of whom will have client-facing roles in a retail and small business banking business. Purposeful growth is dependent on attracting and retaining the best talent. In addition to our industry-leading benefits, we designed a compensation program that also helps teammates who needed most who want the impact of inflation in their daily lives. Second, we had a historic launch of Truist One Banking yesterday. This is our new differentiated suite of checking solutions that reimagine everyday banking, including two new accounts that eliminate overdraft fees and provide greater access to credit. The flagship Truist One checking account has zero overdraft fees and the capability to provide qualifying clients the liquidity they need through a simple $100 negative balance buffer. We also introduced the Truist Confidence Account, which provides consumers with access to main street banking services and no overdraft fees. We're mindful of the impact that inflation and reduced stimulus may have on some of our clients, and Truist One is one of many examples of how we're advancing financial inclusion across our communities. Third, Truist committed $120 million to strengthen and support diverse and small businesses. This commitment exemplifies our purpose by supporting small businesses, which are so vital to the health and vibrancy of our communities. And fourth, we released our 2021 ESG and CSR report in early June. At Truist, we view all the elements of ESG as an opportunity to improve our company and to put our purpose into action, and that includes climate change. As we look to externalize our own net zero aspirations and further the transition to a lower carbon economy, we recently created new advisory practices within our CIB and commercial community bank to help our clients make their own transition. We're pleased with how our clients have welcomed and embraced our advice and expertise around ESG as it underscores the possibilities in viewing ESG as an opportunity for growth. Now turning to Slide 7. Consistent with our previous guidance, merger-related costs totaled $238 million, roughly half of what they were in the first quarter. We expect merger costs to decrease significantly in the back half of 2022 before going away entirely in 2023. This trajectory should be welcome news to shareholders as diminishing merger costs correspond to a less complex narrative, improving earnings quality, more capital and, ultimately, industry-leading returns. Lastly, we incurred a $39 million pre-tax gain related to the early extinguishment of $800 million in FHLB debt. Turning to our second quarter performance highlights on the next slide. We earned $1.5 billion or $1.09 a share on a reported basis. Excluding the selected items on Slide 7, adjusted earnings totaled $1.6 billion or $1.20 a share, down 23% compared to a year ago, primarily due to a sizable reserve release in the prior quarter. Relative to the first quarter, adjusted EPS decreased 2% as higher loan loss provision offset a 10% increase in adjusted PPNR. Adjusted revenue benefited from higher short-term rates alongside well-controlled deposit costs, strong loan growth, consumer seasonality and strong insurance results, partially offset by continued softness in market-sensitive fee businesses such as investment banking, wealth and mortgage. Adjusted ROTCE was 25%, up from 23% in the prior three quarters, even when normalizing things like AOCI to zero and assuming a flat ALLL ratio, adjusted ROTCE was a strong 17%. Adjusted expenses increased 3.8%, reflecting higher insurance-related incentive compensation and intentional investments in talent and technology to support our shift from integrating to operating. Other expenses also increased due to normalization of teammate travel and elevated operational losses. We have planned products, processes and technology enhancements underway to reduce these losses and enhance the overall client experience, including the launch of innovative authentication approaches later this quarter. While operating leverage was a negative 200 basis points year-to-date, this primarily reflects the $435 million year-to-date headwind we have from PPP and PAA revenue. Despite these headwinds, we're still targeting positive operating leverage on both a GAAP and adjusted basis for the full year. Asset quality remains excellent and net charge-offs decreased relative to the first quarter. Capital deployment was healthy in the second quarter as we funded strong loan growth and completed $150 million worth of share repurchases. Capital levels remain strong in light of our risk and profitability profile, demonstrated by our continued strong performance in the 2022 CCAR process. Overall, the second quarter begins to reflect the power of Truist post integration. Now turning to Slide 9. Digital activity increased in the second quarter, attributable to seasonality and nearly 200 enhancements we implemented across the platform, representing a significantly higher pace of value delivery for our clients. Our ability to rapidly incorporate client feedback reflects the capabilities of a more modern and agile digital platform and has resulted in improved client satisfaction scores, which have risen consistently since our initial introduction of Truist Digital in waves in 2021. In June, we announced the grand opening of our state-of-the-art Innovation and Technology Center located within our headquarters, the ITC provides an environment conducive to reimagining the client experience such as by facilitating new ways of working with Agile teams to better collaborate with clients to co-create dynamic and marketable cross-channel services. The new space features client journey rooms, a maker space for building, testing and refining new products and services; a reality lab, where we can utilize virtual and augmented reality technology; and a contact center incubator where we can collect and respond to real-time feedback directly from our clients. I'm personally excited about our improved ability to aid our teammates as they reimagine how we serve clients. We also acquired San Francisco-based Long Game, the award-winning gamification app that utilizes behavioral economics, price link savings and mobile gaming to motivate positive financial behaviors and drive new account growth and client retention. By leveraging Long Game's innovative technology, Truist can empower our clients to build long-term financial wellness. I'm also pleased to report that our merger integration activities are now complete. Our final merger release was rolled out in May and we recently held our last merger Oversight Committee meeting. As we shift to BAU, our digital and technology teams are looking forward to accelerating our pace of innovation and client experience improvements. Yesterday, as I mentioned, we introduced Truist One. And as I referenced earlier -- as I referenced earlier, we will soon expand LightStream to include a new deposit product on a real-time, cloud-based core, enhance the sophistication of our underwriting models through a partnership with Zest; roll out Truist Assist, our virtual assistant to millions of clients, just to name a few examples. Overall, we're increasingly optimistic about the performance and the potential of our increased investment and focus on digital and technology. Now turning to loans and leases on Slide 10. Average loan balances increased a very robust $8.1 billion or 2.8% sequentially with growth across most businesses. The pace of growth accelerated during the quarter with end-of-period loans up 4.7%. Growth was primarily driven by C&I, where average balances increased $6.7 billion or 4.8% overall. We delivered broad-based loan growth across most CIB industry verticals, notably energy, consumer and retail, financial institutions, TMT. Due to M&A activity, the current shift to banks from the bond market increased relevance with new and existing clients and a higher revolver usage for CapEx, inventories and inflation. As in recent quarters, growth continues to be strong within our Asset Finance group as we continue to build out that business with more talent, product capabilities and a larger balance sheet. Commercial Community Bank C&I balances increased 2%, excluding PPP and dealer floor plan, reflecting growth across all our geographic regions and was the second strongest end of period growth since 2019. Revolver utilization increased 300 basis points to just over 30%, the highest level since mid 2020. CRE remains a headwind, reflecting both the highly competitive market and our disciplined approach. At the same time though, I continue to be optimistic about the future of our CRE business as we create a more strategic \u2013 as we create more strategic clarity internally and non-bank competition rationalizes somewhat with rising rates. Wealth lending was up $600 million sequentially as our advisers and clients continue to benefit from the combined capabilities of both heritage firms. Residential mortgage increased 2.6%, reflecting ongoing correspondent purchases and slower prepayment fees. Excluding mortgage, consumer and card balances increased $1 billion or 1.3% as strong growth in Service Finance, Prime Auto, Sheffield and LightStream more than offset runoff in our partnership and student portfolios. Service Finance is performing in line with our high expectations and experiencing good business development momentum given the alignment with Truist. Second quarter production by Service Finance was about double the volume loss and double the profitability from our terminated partnerships. Our prime auto business is also back on its front foot after regaining some momentum it lost following its own fourth quarter conversion. In addition, our consumer finance businesses continue to advance their automated decision capabilities which ultimately improves consistency, efficiency and creates better client experiences. Overall, clients are generally positive on current economic conditions and demand in their businesses. At the same time, concerns about labor shortages and margin pressure, given rising rates and higher input costs, are growing, creating the potential for more defensive postures. Truist is well positioned to advise clients across a range of scenarios given our broad capabilities and talented teammates. Given all of this, we remain generally positive about our prospects for continued loan growth, particularly taking into account our post-integration momentum. At the same time, we have to acknowledge the increased uncertainty associated with the softening economic environment, which may cause loan growth to deviate from this outlook. Turning to deposits on Slide 11. Average deposit balances increased $8.5 billion or 2% during the second quarter, largely attributable to an increase in brokered deposits in mid-March. Excluding brokered deposits, average deposits decreased $2.9 billion or 0.7%. Deposit costs were very well controlled, reflecting Truist's strong retail and commercial oriented franchise and our enviable market share position. In addition, our lines of business and corporate treasury teams delivered excellent execution against a thoughtful strategy to be attentive to client needs and client relationships while maximizing value outside of rate paid. As a result, interest-bearing client deposit betas were 8%, well below our modeled assumptions. As the interest rate environment evolves, we'll continue to take a balanced approach to managing deposit growth and rate paid, particularly given our broad access to other forms of funding. And now let me turn it over to Daryl to review our financial performance in greater detail. Daryl Bible : Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 12. Net interest income increased 7% sequentially, driven by higher short-term interest rates alongside limited deposit betas in addition to strong loan growth. We also saw a positive asset mix shift with the investment portfolio shrinking and funding strong loan growth. As Bill indicated, the strong quality of our deposit franchise also limited deposit rate repricing. Reported net interest margin increased 13 basis points and core net interest margin increased 15 basis points. Net interest margin and net interest income increased for similar reasons and exceeded the high end of our April guidance, primarily due to our teammates delivering lower than modeled deposit betas. Overall, we continue to take a balanced approach to managing interest rate risk. We continue to be asset sensitive and that will decrease over time with the diminishing benefit associated with future rate increases and the disintermediation of funding sources. We forecasted an approximate 25% cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta through the second and third quarters. To protect against any potential downside in rates, we also added $16 billion of swaps, which are primarily forward starting. These swaps begin in 2023 and 2024 and will have laddered maturities that range from three to five years to minimize earnings volatility. Moving to Slide 13. Fee income increased $106 million or 4.9% sequentially. Insurance income increased $98 million due to the seasonality, strong organic growth and the full quarter of Kensington Vanguard acquisition. Car and payment-related fees increased $34 million, reflecting the prior quarter acquisition of merchant relationships and the increased activity. Residential mortgage income decreased $15 million or 17% as higher interest rates pressured volumes and gain-on-sale margins. Servicing income was essentially flat from the prior quarter as lower prepays were offset by increasing hedging costs. While this is a very challenging environment for mortgage, our mortgage team is playing some offense. By leveraging Truist's strong purpose and balance sheet to hire select, well-regarded loan officers as well as acquire certain servicing portfolios. Investment banking and trading income was relatively flat sequentially and declined 37% year-over-year as market volatility continues to negatively impact most products. Investment banking pipelines remain full across all products, but the realization of these pipelines will continue to remain subject to more stable market conditions. Service charges on deposits were relatively flat sequentially as favorable seasonal trends were offset by the elimination of certain overdraft fees in April, resulting in client savings of approximately $20 million during the quarter.  We included a table at the bottom of Slide 13 to make other income trends more clear. Other income, excluding changes in our nonqualified plan and last quarter's merchant gain, decreased $25 million, primarily due to a loss on a certain sale of SBIC funds to diversify our private equity investment portfolio.  Turning to Slide 14. Reported expenses decreased $94 million sequentially to $3.6 billion. The lower expenses were driven by $180 million or 43% reduction in merger costs due to diminishing integration activity. Adjusted expenses increased $119 million. Personnel expenses increased $64 million due to seasonally higher insurance-related incentive compensation, the full impact of normal first quarter compensation increases and ongoing investments in talent across our lines of business and technology teams.  In addition, other expense increased $19 million due to higher operational losses and ongoing normalization of teammate travel. Professional fees and outside processing costs increased $16 million, primarily due to the increase in call center staffing. As Bill mentioned, our minimum wage will increase to $22 per hour effective October 1. This represents a significant investment in our teammates and is expected to increase our personnel expense by $200 million annually, offset by lower turnover expense and improved execution and client experience.  Moving to Slide 15. Asset quality remains excellent, reflecting our prudent risk culture, diverse portfolio and solid economic conditions. Leading credit indicators remain benign. Criticized and classified commercial loans decreased 6% sequentially and are 37% lower to a year ago. Our NPL ratio was flat at 36 basis points and loans 30 to 89 days past due decreased 3 basis points to 69 basis points. Our net charge-off ratio also decreased 3 basis points to 22 basis points. We experienced a slight build in the allowance due to loan growth. Although the allowance coverage ratio decreased 6 basis points to 138 basis points, given our strong portfolio performance, tempered somewhat by our moderately slower economic outlook. While the weighting of our pessimistic baseline and optimistic scenarios were unchanged from the first quarter, each scenario is moderately worse, a trend that may continue. Moving on Slide 16. Our CET1 ratio declined 20 basis points to 9.2%, strong loan growth and a $250 million share repurchase during the second quarter. As previously announced, our Board will consider an 8% increase in the quarterly common dividend at its July meeting. If approved, the increase will take effect in the third quarter and will continue to position Truist as one of the dividend leaders in our peer group. We were also pleased with the performance during the 2022 stress test. Truist had the second lowest CET1 erosion and a loan loss reserve rate in the peer group under severely adverse scenario. Our preliminary stress test capital buffer remained flat at 250 basis points. We believe these results demonstrate our strong capital relative to the risk and profitability profile, the latter of which should improve over time. We are now more comfortable operating below our previously announced CET1 ratio target of 9.75% given our continued strong stress test results and significantly reduced integration risk. Overall, the economic outlook will influence how much we operate below the prior target. From a funding perspective, end-of-period loan growth exceeded deposit growth. Truist has multiple sources available to fund incremental loan growth, as seen this quarter with the use of brokered deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank advances and our securities portfolio. I will now provide guidance for full year 2022 and new guidance for the third quarter. In 2022, we now expect adjusted revenue to grow 3.5% to 4.5% from 2021. The mixture of revenue continues to tilt more towards net interest income given the outlook for higher short-term interest rates, partially offset by lower fees, primarily in market-sensitive businesses such as investment banking, mortgage, and wealth. We now expect adjusted non-interest expense to increase 2% to 3% from 2021. This increase in expense outlook largely reflects higher operating losses and intentional investments to support our shift from integrating to operating, including increasing our minimum wage, hiring teammates to support client experience and growth, and ongoing investments in technology. Net-net, this is slightly higher PPNR outlook versus our previously full year guide. In light of our performance during the first half of the year and the benign credit environment, we expect net charge-off ratio to be in the 25 to 35 basis points for the full year. Looking into the third quarter, we expect adjusted PPNR to grow high single-digits in the second quarter level, primarily as a result of higher net interest income, partially offset by higher non-interest expense. We expect mid-20 basis point increase in our core net interest margin due to the benefits from recent rate hikes and a projected 75 basis point hike in July. We also expect low 20 basis point increase in GAAP net interest margin as a result of core net interest margin expansion, offset by continued declines in purchase accounting accretion. Now, I'll turn it back to Bill to conclude. Bill Rogers : Thanks Daryl. And moving to Slide 17. On our previous earnings call in April, I expressed my belief that the first quarter marked a strategic and financial turning point for Truist. Our second quarter results are bearing out this thesis and we're beginning to deliver on the potential of Truist. For businesses that finished conversions in 2021, the increased momentum is palpable. Wealth continues to build momentum in hiring advisers who are attracted to Truist's purpose and broad set of capabilities, both within wealth and across the company through IRM. Wealth net adviser count grew in the second quarter for the first time in 10 quarters. With our recent entry into the Chicago market, Truist Wealth now serves nine of the 10 largest metropolitan areas in the United States. In addition, net organic asset flows have been positive for five straight quarters. In our mortgage business, client satisfaction scores for origination have improved every month since their conversion in August of 2021. The percentage of retail client applications completed digitally is now 97%. For the rest of the company where core bank conversions were completed in the first quarter of 2022, momentum is also building. Loan production in the second quarter was the highest it's been at Truist and up 41% compared to the first quarter. Pipelines also ended the quarter at the highest we've seen. Branch loan production, which is primarily home equity was up 24% relative to the first quarter and the highest it's been at Truist. Consumer deposit production, both in the branches and within digital was up 29% sequentially and 20% year-over-year. Retail Banking Net Promoter and client satisfaction scores have rebounded nicely from their March lows and still have more opportunity to improve. Deposit production within our commercial community bank is up 8% relative to the first quarter. PCB-related IRM revenue was up 21% sequentially with increased activity across all products with significant momentum highlighting the power of our advice-driven model. Financially, net interest income and margin rebounded from the first quarter low point, as expected. While fee income did not improve to the extent we had hoped, our second quarter results underscore the importance of our diverse business mix and we believe fees will improve as market conditions normalize and we capitalize on our significant IRM and revenue synergy opportunities. In addition, merger costs are declining rapidly, and we're making good progress towards realizing our remaining cost saves as we decommission data centers and systems in the back half of the year, all of which will help drive positive operating leverage for the full year 2022. So to conclude on Slide 18, Truist is on the right path, and I'm highly optimistic about our potential, all of which is clearly summarized in our investment thesis. Strategically, our focus has clearly shifted to executional excellence, transformation and growth. We're shifting millions of hours of integration related activity to improving our client experience through investments in digital and technology, simplification of our processes and operations and, of course, by continuing to activate our purpose each and every day. We're also focused on capturing the significant IRM and revenue synergy potential we have, as this is squarely in the center of building better lives for our clients. These shifts and activities do not require incremental risk appetite or capital at only requires execution and focus. At the same time, while we believe the economy is currently healthy, the effects of ongoing geopolitical uncertainty, coupled with still too high inflation and an aggressive forecast for tightening the monetary policy, have somewhat diminished the economic outlook as we move further into this year and into next. Truist is nevertheless well positioned across a broad range of economic outcomes given our advice oriented model for clients, strong absolute and relative markets, conservative credit culture, diverse business mix, a strong capital position relative to our risk profile and, most importantly, our power shift from a focus on integration to executional excellence and growth. And with that, let me turn it back over to you, Ankur. Ankur Vyas : Thanks, Bill. Jennifer, at this time, will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session? As you do that, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary question and one follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Bill Rogers : Good morning. Daryl Bible : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : A couple of questions just on how you're thinking about the funding mix. I know you had several comments in your prepared remarks around accessing some of the pools you have. Could you talk a little bit about what you're doing with deposit pricing for your core deposits, how you're thinking about utilizing brokered from here? And then if you could speak a little bit about the hedge that you put on for protecting earnings against future volatility and where we should expect that to show up in the NIM and how that's going to factor into your outlook for your rate sensitivity? Thanks. Daryl Bible : Yes, Betsy. So I would first start with, we were really excited to have really strong broad-based loan growth this quarter, and we expect that to continue, as Bill said in his prepared remarks. To fund that, we're going to start with the runoff of our investment portfolio. We built the investment portfolio when we had all that excess liquidity. We're very comfortable letting that run off and have that -- have a positive mix change on the balance sheet. As far as brokered deposits, we did add some brokered deposits over the last several months. I would say, we're probably at where we want to be from that perspective, knowing that we still have a lot of capacity and other funding sources available in the marketplace. You look at Federal Home Loan Bank advances and negotiable CDs and other amounts, we paid all that off during COVID in 2020 and we have much amount of capacity there. The other thing from an investment portfolio perspective, we're about $145 billion, give or take. And we feel comfortable we could shrink that portfolio probably $20 billion to $25 billion easily and still stay within our liquidity and LCR guidelines that we have to for regulatory purposes. Though, as far as our strategies for pricing, we were really pleased, as Bill talked about, across our company, our deposit betas came in much better than modeled. We modeled 25 for the first 100. And if you look in the second quarter, we came at 15, and that includes brokered. When you back out the brokered, we were only at 8%, which is really, really low. I would say, we will continue to use that strategy. We're going to make sure that we take care of our clients and use the ability to do exception pricing. But I think overall, I think we will continue to hopefully continue to outperform our model expectations. Bill Rogers : Betsy, one thing I'd add is that, I think, we'll be somewhat stable for deposits for the balance of the year. But remember, as Daryl pointed out, we had just under 2% growth in DDA. So I mean we're adding net new clients and expanding those relationships. And I think the beta really just reflects the benefits of the merger. We're sitting now with just under 20% market share in most of our markets. We've got a business that's highly diversified. Somewhere around 40-plus percent of our deposits are less than $250,000. So we've got a unique franchise here which I think, on the DDA side, continues to benefit and overall stable deposits for the balance of the year. Betsy Graseck : And the loan growth\u2026 Daryl Bible : And your hedge question. Bill Rogers : Oh, yeah, yeah. Daryl Bible : I just \u2013 we are just gradually starting to add some receivers out in the forward markets for the most part out one to two years. Since we are steady on the way up on deposit rates, you won't have as much capacity on the way down. So we're just putting in these forward hedges and protect manages income as rates might potentially fall overall. But we still are asset sensitive though decreasing as rates continue to go up. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay. No, that's helpful. And then on your point on loan growth, yeah, loan growth was very strong. And I guess the follow-up question here is, what are you hearing from the field with regard to the pace of that loan growth? Is it poised to accelerate, continue at this pace for the foreseeable future? Just a little bit of a sensing color for how we should be thinking about that? Thanks so much. Bill Rogers : Yeah, Betsy, and that's the question of long-term sustainability. But on the short-term basis and through the balance of this year, if we sort of look on a year-over-year basis, we were sort of in the mid-single figures. I think, we'll be in the higher end of the single figures in terms of loan growth. Our teams are excited. Our production numbers, which I highlighted, are up significantly. Our pipelines are up. So we're \u2013 I think we're seeing a little bit of maybe idiosyncratic to us, and our shift to integration in terms of prowess on the loan side. And the great news is that, it is extremely broad-based. So not only is it in the C&I side, but our core branch network, I mean, their applications are up, personal loans are up, HELOC\u2019s are up. So similarly, they're starting to execute at a much higher level. Betsy Graseck : Yeah. Operator : We'll go next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Yes. Good morning. Sorry about that. Yeah, as a follow-up on the fee side, you had great insurance revenue this quarter, up 13%. We heard your comments about some of the challenges looking out on some of the other lines. So can you just kind of help us walk through just what you're expecting on the fee income side, inside that third quarter PPNR outlook that you gave, because I think you talked mostly just about higher NII and higher expenses. So any granularity on the fee side would be great? Thank you. Bill Rogers : Yeah. Hey, Ken. Let me \u2013 let me maybe just do a walk through of the broad categories. I think sort of overall, I'd say, fee income stable relative to the first half, and maybe let me give you some puts and takes against that. Insurance, as you noted, solid organic growth that will offset some of that seasonality. So I feel really good about the momentum that we have there. And as we mentioned earlier, we're continuing to invest in the insurance business. So we feel good about the growth there. Mortgage, some puts and takes. Origination probably a little bit offset by servicing. Gain of sales, probably a little bit of a wildcard there in terms of whether we see some rebound on that side as some of the capacity comes out, but mortgage probably a little flat second half of the year to the first half of the year. Wealth probably be a little bit down in the third quarter, just sort of where markets are right now. But as I highlighted earlier, our \u2013 really solid production and asset flows and hiring net advisers, so if we get a little market tailwind that could change. Investment banking, I think we expect the second half to be better than the first. Pipelines continue to be really solid. And then we've got a bit of things that are unique to us. We've got this really good IRM momentum from our commercial community bank, that's probably a little bit less market dependent. I'd, sort of, call that more sort of bread and butter kind of investment banking business. And then we've added bankers there also and we're continuing to invest. So we're leaning in there. And then on the service charge side, with the decisions we've made with Truist One and overdraft decisions that will be down. So sort of net-net, that's, I think, a good walk through on the fee income side. Ken Usdin : Great, okay. And then second question just on, you had talked about operating lower CET1 than your 9.75%. We saw a 9.2% this quarter. And just what you're thinking, you saw you did a little buyback, just in terms of capital allocation decisions and potential for more of those insurance deals that you guys have been biased towards over time? Thanks Bill. Bill Rogers : Yeah. So I mean, the really great news is we're using capital exactly where we want to right now, so we're using it with growth. So we've been funding the loan growth. As we've talked about, our capital levels were driven by merger risk, CCAR results and economic uncertainty. I think merger risk is largely behind us. Very pleased with the CCAR results, our low risk profile, better PPNR profile. Economic uncertainty, it was really high during the pandemic, moderated and maybe increasing a little bit. So we've got to balance all of those. But we're comfortable where we are. We've had more organic growth. We do see more opportunity in some of the non-bank M&A, as you noted. So we're going to allow capacity and be opportunistic there as well. And then we generate -- post merger, we'll generate somewhere around 25 basis points of capital a quarter organically. If you say, okay, we will use about 15 basis points of that to fund the current growth that we have and anticipate, we've got about 10 basis points net. So I think that gives us the requisite flexibility to fund the growth that we anticipate; be flexible, as you noted, for potential non-bank M&A, particularly on the insurance side. And so if you add all that, share repurchase probably is not our top priority at this particular juncture. Ken Usdin : Thanks for all that, Bill. Bill Rogers : All right. Sure. Operator : We'll go next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Bill. Good morning, Daryl. Bill Rogers : Good morning. Daryl Bible : Good morning. Gerard Cassidy : Bill, can you share with us, you obviously put together a very good quarter this quarter and you put some very strong numbers in your comments at the very end of the prepared remarks about growth. But then you've cautioned it, of course, with what's going on at the macro scene, with monetary policy and such. Can you share with us what you're seeing from your customers because there seems to be a disconnect. A lot of investors are very concerned about credit deterioration. You certainly don't see it, nor do your peers. But is there something on the horizon other than the macro that you guys are seeing, or what are your early indicators you're looking at to see if there will be a crack in credit maybe in six or 12 months? Bill Rogers : Yeah. I mean, sort of, going down the categories of that question, our clients still see a lot of good demand. I may be a little bit clouded by the fact the last two markets I was in were South Florida and Nashville and you know, there's -- they are blowing and going in virtually every direction. But our clients continue to see good demand. I think it's appropriate to put a cautious note just because I think you have to. And if we look at sort of what are the canaries in the coal mine, so to speak, what are the things that we're trying to look at, and while we don't see a deterioration, I think the things you look at are things like what's happening in the broadly syndicated sponsor-backed leverage deals. So we sort of look at that market, spreads gapped out pretty significantly. Things happening in CRE. We've seen some non-recourse construction loans and some things that you sort of pause a little bit on. Some potential FICO drift and willingness to repay given some of the stimulus. Will things happen in mortgage as some of the Care Act relief comes off? Now all those things that are there, we're not seeing in our results right now, but they are things that we're looking at and that we're stressing and trying to pay attention to. So I think just we're bankers, so we should be conservative. That's the world we live in and we try to manage for all outcomes. But sitting here today, looking at the hood of the car, demand looks pretty good and our business looks pretty good and our clients are extremely healthy. Gerard Cassidy : No, that's very good. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, Daryl, you mentioned the deposit beta, it came in better than expected. I think you said without the brokered deposits, it came in around 8 basis points. I think you guys were modeling for something closer to 25. Can you share with us, what drove the better-than-expected number? And second, as the Fed goes another 75, assuming they do in July and then obviously further rate increases later this year, could the modeling work against you? Meaning could the betas actually go faster later in the year because rates are moving up so quickly? Daryl Bible : Yes. So Gerard, I would just tell you that I think it was a lot of great work with our teammates. We're working with clients and giving what we thought was appropriate. Most of our clients aren't there just for rate because we have other products and services. They really like to bank with us for those reasons. So they aren't as rate-sensitive as other clients might be in other places. So I think that's really the benefit of our franchise. I do agree with you though, as interest rates go up, our deposit betas will continue to climb just because more and more people will get a little bit more asset-sensitive. In the prepared remarks, I did say that our cumulative beta would move from 15% to 25% in the second to third quarter on a cumulative basis. We would still expect it to go on if the Fed continues to raise interest rates that you continue to see Fed cumulative beta increasing. And probably if you look at from second quarter to fourth quarter, we may be in the low 30s, give or take a couple of percentage points there. So overall, if you go back to where we were during the Great Recession, much better overall performance than what we had a few of our banks were combined back then. So I think right now, I think we feel very good. And I think that you're going to see really positive growth in our net interest income because of that. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you, gentlemen. Appreciate it. Operator : We'll go next to Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. I just want to follow up on the expense guide. Obviously, overall, the PPNR guide is higher, but the expenses have been an area of focus, I think, for the company since the merger. And I did just want to kind of follow up on what's driving the tweak up by roughly 1% on expenses, especially since the fees are coming in a little bit weaker and net interest income tends not to have a lot of fees or a lot of expenses related to it.  And then just as we think about the follow-up with the confidence that you can control expenses kind of next year without the benefit of this kind of merger and other merger-related costs that will be done this year? Bill Rogers : Yes. Matt, this is Bill. No eye off the ball on expenses, I can assure you that. So, the competencies that we've built through the merger to manage expenses, understand expenses, create continued improvements are all still there and will be a big part of our expense story for this year and for the years going forward. And a big part of our capability to deliver positive operating leverage and I think industry-leading efficiency ratio. So, no lack of focus on the expense side. And we have lots of things underway in terms of, how we would achieve those additional opportunities.  But on the same side, we're going to -- we're investing in our business. And just like we've seen some of this momentum we've talked about, particularly coming from the first quarter into this quarter, we don't want to miss those opportunities. And those opportunities don't line up quarter-to-quarter. They \u2013 I think they line up well. We have confidence in the investments we've made in talent and insurance, wealth, investment banking, care centers, as an example, improved revenue potential, improve the client experience.  And we have a pretty good formula for long-term paybacks on those investments. I mean, we've been at this and have a pretty good understanding of that. Also, the investments in our teammates for the minimum wage. So that was -- that's a clear step up. I think in fairness, that overtime others will be in that same position. But we just felt like, as I mentioned earlier, it was important for us to lead. This is a time when those teammates need us most. I think it will really help us long term in terms of retention and acquisition of key talent. So, it also has an immediate bump-up and a longer-term payback, which I feel really good about.  And then the one that's just trickier and a little more quarter and year-end specific is just the increase in operating losses and they are up. They're up higher than we think they should be. We have a lot of things in place to do that. We made some decisions related to the client experience that I think increased some of those operating losses. But I'm confident that they'll normalize overtime given the investments we're making in that part.  But that's the only part that I would say is the non-investment part of the increase in the expense side and I think we'll be more positive about that long term and normalizing those expenses. Matt O'Connor: And what exactly are those operating losses? Maybe you can give an example or two? And is any of that related to the deal conversion and any follow-up from that, to be blunt? Thank you. Bill Rogers : Yes. I mean there are decisions we made relative to client experience. I'll give you an example of. On the fraud side is, giving the client the benefit of the doubt upfront. So, if a client has an experience, we're going to get the money back from another bank and what we're doing is go ahead and funding that client now. That has a one-time increase. But over time, that normalizes, just as an example. And we think that's a good client experience and something, again, that will normalize over time. It's just one example. Daryl Bible : You also asked for containment of expenses on a go-forward basis. As we look to rationalize and get back to business as usual, I think there's still opportunities in our corporate real estate portfolio. I think as we continue to rationalize our branch network on closure of some branches over time just as behaviors change with our clients. I think we've talked about this before, but we still have a lot of initiatives that our teammates came up with that would help us from both the cost savings as well as revenue and client experience perspective, and we're in the midst of implementing those over the next 12 to 18 months. We also are moving towards a new card platform over the next year or two, which would generate some savings once we both combine to that. From a technology perspective, we are starting to put more applications up into the cloud which, over time, we're also generating some savings. And last thing I just want to mention is, as you look at our operations, both front and back office, the digitization and artificial intelligence projects that are rolling out, all part and very important to how the company runs and operates. It gives us comfort that our expenses will be contained over the next year or two. Matt O'Connor: Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi. Well, Bill, you gave me the opening, you talked about the hood of the car, so I'll go with the Corvette analogy again. And it looks like -- on the positive, it looks like you're going from first to second gear, right? You said end-of-period loans are up 5%, that's accelerating. You're beating on deposit beta. Your NIM is up, you expect it to be up maybe in the range of 25 basis points next quarter. NII is going higher. And you still have the decommissioning of the data centers and all the apps later this year, so that should help. So, next second year, fantastic. But then I look at the speed that you're going and it doesn't seem to be a lot faster. Yes, PPNR guidance, a little bit higher. But you're guiding for 50 basis points plus operating leverage for this year, if you took the aero [ph] part of your bands. And some of your peers are 200, 300, 400 basis points. I think last quarter, that difference was 100 basis points. So, in a way, the operating leverage is a little bit less than I think what you were guiding in the first quarter. And I hear you, you're not taking your eye off the ball on expenses. You're investing in minimum wage. You have some operating losses. But still, it just seems like the power of the Corvette is still not being fully realized. So, where are you in that progression of translating the power of the engine to the power of the growth and the power of the operating leverage because your efficiency ratio is not really in the ZIP code of the initial figures you gave when you announced the merger three and a half years ago. Thank you. Bill Rogers : Yes. A couple of things, Mike. So, I appreciate the acknowledgment of second gear at least. I don't know how many gears your Corvette has, but at least there's an acknowledgment of the second gear. And I think we are seeing that -- we are seeing that growth. And I feel really good about the migration from the first to the second quarter. If loan growth is one of those indicators, but I don't think it's always the indicator, but if I look at production and pipelines and just the things that we're doing, and it's broad-based, so it's not one thing, it's the whole engine operating at a faster pace. But if we're going to continue to just grind on the corvette thing, you got to put gas in it. And you got to put -- and gas is more expensive. We want to drive it faster. And we're really confident in the things that we're investing in and the capability of the company long-term. As it relates to the efficiency ratio from the first guidance, I mean, remember that was in an interest rate environment that was pretty different than where we are now. I still believe, and we're delivering and prospectively will deliver industry-leading efficiency ratio with growth. Whether it's at 55 or low 50s, I don't know, but I am confident that it will be industry-leading in any different -- in any rate environment. So I feel good about that. And then we've got market sensitive businesses that are sitting on the launching pad and really good capability to grow significantly if we get a little bit of tailwind. And that tailwind could come in the fourth quarter, it could come next year, but it's going to come, and we're better positioned than we've ever been to capitalize on those opportunities. Mike Mayo : I guess what my question is getting to, perhaps some of the other questions, and I know I'm not going to get an answer, but you can give it qualitatively. Looking out at 2023, when you finally have all the merger savings in your numbers and when you finally have realized some of these -- some of the noisy financial items such as the operating losses and you finally are done with these one-off charges, which are going down, what sort of operating leverage we can expect next year? At least if you can answer that qualitatively or if you want to put numbers around it, we'd love it. Bill Rogers : Yes. Qualitatively, it's got to be qualitatively, we just don't know what the rate environment is going to be. So qualitatively, it will be positive. That's the angle that we're gaining towards and committed to. But similarly, and I think, again, you're seeing it this quarter, with revenue growth that reflects the power of this franchise and an efficient expense model that supports that. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Erika Najarian with UBS. Erika Najarian : Yes. Hi. I -- just to follow-up on the corvette analogy. You are driving this car and in theory the roads are getting worse, right? So maybe the first question I have is, in the last crisis, both companies did fairly well, relatively well from a credit perspective. And Daryl, as you think about the different scenarios for ACL buildup in a downturn, a lot of investors are comfortable thinking about where the banking industry could be in a charge-offs scenario, but none of us can limit the CECL process, right? So I guess the question is, in a mild recession scenario, how much more ACL build do you think would be ahead of you for what the charge-offs that you think your portfolio would produce? Daryl Bible : Hey, Erika, I'll start and Clarke can help finish me off on this. But when we set the amounts, obviously, it's scenario-based. It's always forward-looking from that perspective. In the prepared remarks, we did say that there is potential that the scenarios can continue to deteriorate. If that is the case, then you would expect us to continue to add to our allowance. And that would add to our provision costs as that moves up from that perspective. But right now, we aren't seeing a whole lot. And there could be some deterioration from that perspective, but let me kick it back over to Clarke. Clarke Starnes : Yes, Erika, I would just say this, and Bill mentioned it and Daryl earlier, as we came through the quarter, we refreshed all of our scenarios. So our baseline, which is 40% of our estimate, is a more pessimistic outlook, slower economy. And then, we have a 30% weight on a recessionary, a more pessimistic scenario. So we feel like we've been pretty conservative in our estimate this quarter. And also this quarter, we had really good loan growth and very highly rated credits. So those carry a lower relative reserve rate. So that's why you didn't see a big build this quarter. You saw 6 basis points decline in our allowance. That was because of the growth. So we believe we've accounted for some of the recessionary risk right now. And so, as we look forward, the main driver of changing the allowance would be growth. Unless the scenarios get more severe, and then obviously, our reserve rate would have to change. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you for taking my question. Ankur Vyas : Jennifer, we\u2019ve got time for one more question. Operator : We'll take our last question from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Good morning. Just on the -- also on the credit front, can you just talk about, are you seeing any emerging signs of stress within the portfolio, particularly as you look at some of the lower-end consumer, maybe in your regional acceptance business on the non-prime side or the Sheffield business? If you can just talk about where, if any, that you're seeing some of the cracks form. Thanks. Beau Cummins : Look, I mean, we are monitoring that very carefully. So I think what we're seeing probably a little bit of indication would be the low to moderate income consumer, think cohorts $50,000 incomes and below. We're seeing higher delinquent -- early delinquency in those areas. But it's not translated yet into higher late-stage delinquencies or losses. So, for example, in our subprime auto business, we had one of our lower loss rates this quarter seasonally and we're seeing things slightly because of the Manheim being up, consumers higher redemption rates even on repo. So it's not yet translated into any losses. We've also looked at our deposit levels or our consumer borrowers and they're not coming down rapidly, particularly for the moderate income and above. So while there's early signs we're watching, it's not translated into any significant concerns. And our outlook right now for the rest of the year does not assume any significant deterioration. John Pancari : Got it. Okay. And then just separately on the loan growth side, I know you indicated that you did see some pressure there this quarter on commercial real estate, but you seem a bit more optimistic there in stabilization. How should we think about the growth in that portfolio? Is there the potential for incremental declines there, or do you think stabilization will happen beginning next quarter? Thanks. Bill Rogers : Yes. I'm sure it's quarter-to-quarter, but I think we're stabilizing, is the way I would say it, and into more of a growth mode. And by the way, we feel really comfortable about it. We've made decisions through the cycle that create a really good portfolio. We've done a lot of things internally strategically to get really, really strong alignment around the type of CRE portfolio we want, the diversity that we want. So probably somewhere in the next couple of quarters, stabilizing with the -- bent for growth over time. John Pancari : Got it. All right. Thanks, Bill. Ankur Vyas : Thanks, John, and thanks, everybody. That completes our earnings call. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to the IR team. Thank you for your interest in Truist. We hope you have a great day. Jennifer, you can now disconnect the call. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Truist Financial Corporation Third Quarter 2021 [2022] (sic) Earnings Conference Call. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Ankur Vyas, Head of Investor Relations with Truist Financial Corporation. Please go ahead. Ankur Vyas : Thank you, Jake, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist's third quarter 2022 earnings call. With us today are our Chairman and CEO, Bill Rogers; and our CFO, Mike Maguire. During this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's third quarter results and share their perspectives on our efforts to transition from an integration focus to an operating focus, current business conditions and our continued activation of Truist's purpose. Clarke Starnes, our Vice Chair and Chief Risk Officer; Beau Cummins, our Vice Chair; and John Howard, our Chief Insurance Officer, are also in attendance and are available to participate in the Q&A portion of the call. The accompanying presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information, are available on the Truist Investor Relations website, ir.truist.com. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slides 2 and 3 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix for the appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. In addition, Truist is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized live and archived webcast are located on our website. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill. Bill Rogers : Thanks, Ankur, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. Our third quarter reflected strong progress in many areas overall. However, financial performance was mixed, reflecting continued challenging market conditions. Strong spread income resulted from significant margin expansion that exceeded our guidance and strong broad-based loan growth. Credit quality remains excellent. At the same time, capital markets revenue did not rebound as anticipated, and in fact, declined link quarter. Strategically, we continue to realize the benefits of shifting from integrating to operating, which I'll share more on later. I acknowledge that operating losses continue to be too high. However, other expense growth reflects targeted investments in talented technology in key areas of long-term sustainable growth. Merger calls diminished again, and our remaining decommissioning activities are mostly complete and be finalized by year-end. We'll share details on each of these themes throughout the call. And turning to our purpose on Slide 4, Truist is a purpose-driven company that's dedicated to inspire and build better lives and communities. This commitment to purpose and our value of care could not have been more apparent in how our teammates responded to each other and their clients and the aftermath of Hurricane Ian. I experienced this firsthand when I visited with our teams in Southwest Florida soon after the storm subsided. Clients expressed their significant appreciation that we opened our branches to care for them during this time loss. The many truckloads of food, water supplies and other critical items that we sent to the region made a real difference. And the $1.25 million donation from the Truist Foundation will continue to provide support to affected areas in Florida. Have begun, and Truist is committed to supporting these communities in the short term, but also helping them be more resilient in the long term. And this is one of the many ways we're living our purpose, as you can see on Slide 5. In order to inspire, it's often necessary to be bold and to be first, and that's exactly what we did on October 1. We made a significant investment in our teammates by raising our minimum wage to $22 per hour. The new minimum wage benefits approximately 14,000 teammates, about 80% of whom are in client-facing roles. We strongly believe this action will drive purposeful growth and offset the estimated $200 million increase in annual personnel expense through improved teammate recruitment and retention, lower turnover expense, better execution and an all-around better client experience. In fact, we're already starting to see the benefits of the higher minimum wage. Teller turnover in August and September was down about 25% compared to the first seven months of the year. Our branch vacancy rates have been cut in half since July. We also advanced our commitment to inspire with the launch of Truist One Banking in July. Truist One is our differentiated suite of checking solutions that reimagine everyday banking, including two new accounts that eliminate overdraft fees and provide greater access to credit. The flagship Truist One checking account has zero overdraft fees and the capability to provide qualifying clients the liquidity they need through a simple $100 negative balance buffer. We also introduced the Truist Confidence Account, which provides consumers access to mainstream banking services and no overdraft fees. These accounts meaningfully advance financial inclusion in our communities and have been embraced by new and existing clients. Since their launch, overall branch deposit production has increased 13% in August and September compared to the prior year despite having 16% fewer branches. We're also in the process of rolling out our cash reserve deposit base credit line up to $750. We began a pilot earlier this month and expect the cash reserve feature to be available across our footprint later this quarter. Now turning to Slide 7. Merger costs totaled $152 million, down 30% sequentially and 58% year-over-year as our integration activities wind down. The final merger costs expected in the fourth quarter are primarily related to our decommissioning efforts, which, as I mentioned, will conclude by year-end. The completion of merger activities is a monumental move forward that will reflect a seamless client experience, simplify our narrative, enhance our earnings quality, improve capital and help us realize industry-leading returns. Turning to our third quarter performance highlights on Slide 8. We earned $1.5 billion or $1.15 per share on a reported basis. Adjusted earnings totaled $1.7 billion or $1.24 per share, up 3% sequentially as 5% adjusted PPNR growth was partially offset by higher provision as a result of our higher consumer net charge-offs. Net interest income grew 10% to a post-merger high, benefiting from higher short-term rates and well-controlled deposit costs, all of which drove significant margin expansion as well as strong broad-based loan growth. Despite solid forward progress, the pace of PPNR growth was weaker than we had anticipated, primarily due to ongoing pressure in investment banking, as well as unfavorable valuation marks taken at quarter end. Adjusted expenses increased 2.6% link quarter mostly as expected; however, operational losses remain elevated. While we made a purposeful decision to proactively refund our clients for fraud losses, our overall goal is to reduce them significantly to improve our results and the client experience. This is an industry-wide phenomenon. Part of our technology spend is directly related to this effort. These investments include efforts to enhance identity authentication and fraud detection, among others. Adjusted operating leverage was a strong 260 basis points compared to the third quarter of last year, reflecting strong net interest income growth, combined with modest expense growth. This momentum has helped us close the gap towards our goal of positive operating leverage for the full year 2022. Asset quality remains excellent, notwithstanding normalizing trends and a seasonal uptick and net charge-offs within our consumer portfolios. We deployed 10 basis points of capital to support strong loan growth and complete the Benefitmall acquisition, which expands our capabilities and fills a strategic gap in our wholesale insurance business. Our capital position remains strong relative to our risk and profitability profile, and we're confident in our ability to withstand and outperform in a range of economic scenarios. Now turning to Slide 9. Digital activity continues to increase from the first quarter levels, reflecting strong momentum post-integration. This progress reflects our significantly improved agility and responsiveness from being on one digital platform. Year-to-date, we've delivered 3x more production releases across business, retail and wealth than in all of 2021. Client satisfaction with their digital experience has also improved rapidly each quarter. Consistent with our pivot from integrating to operating, our technology and digital teams are allocating more of their time, energy and resources to transformation and innovation. To that end, we recently launched Truist Assist to our retail and wealth clients through our mobile and online banking platforms. Truist Assist is our AI-enhanced virtual assistant that leverages natural language processing and natural language understanding to interact and respond to client questions. Through September 30, Truist Assist had been deployed to our personal banking clients and had been utilized by 114,000 unique clients to handle 147,000 interactions that otherwise might have occurred in a branch or contact center. We're also expanding LightStream, both by enhancing the sophistication of its underwriting models through artificial intelligence, and by piloting a new savings product to broaden its capability set. In addition, the recent acquisition of the Arena platform from software start-up Zaloni will help accelerate our data journey through the development of a stronger integrated data infrastructure solution deployed in a hybrid cloud environment. As a result, our data quality, analytics and speed to market will all significantly improve. Overall, I'm highly optimistic about the potential of our increased investments and capabilities to enhance performance and client experience. Turning to loans and leases on Slide 10. Loan growth was strong and broad-based for the second consecutive quarter. Average balances grew $13 billion or 4.3% sequentially in part due to our shift from integrating to operating. C&I remains strong as average balances grew $7 billion or 4.5%. C&I loans grew across most CIB industry verticals and product groups, reflecting higher revolver utilization, the current shift to banks from the bond market and our increased competitiveness for new and existing clients. Revolver utilization increased just over 100 basis points to approximately 31%, the highest level since the second quarter of 2020. In our commercial community bank, C&I balances, excluding PPP and dealer floor plan increased 1.3%, the seventh consecutive quarter of growth. We achieved growth across almost all of our CCB regions. Residential mortgage balances increased $4 billion or 8.2%, reflecting previous correspondent mortgage production and slower prepayment speeds. Excluding mortgage, consumer and card balances increased 3.1%, a strong growth in Prime Auto, Service Finance, LightStream, recreational lending and Sheffield, more than offset runoff in our partnership and student portfolios. Production in our consumer finance business is up 20% year-over-year, reflecting good business development momentum with Service Finance, abating inventory shortages within Sheffield and RAC and improved automated decisioning capabilities across the board, which ultimately improves consistency, efficiency and creates better client experiences. Near term, our loan growth outlook remains healthy as our pipelines are relatively strong and teammates continue to shift their capacity from integrating to operating and take advantage of new tools in their toolkit. Over the medium term, loan growth may moderate as clients absorb and digest the impact of higher rates, higher inflation and slowing growth. We also expect growth in residential mortgage and Prime Auto to slow going forward as we shift our capital towards higher return opportunities. Truist continues to remain well-positioned to advise clients across a broad range of economic scenarios, given our capabilities, talented teammates and increased capacity post integration. Now turning to deposits on Slide 11. Average deposits decreased $3.7 billion or just under 1% in the third quarter driven by tightening monetary policy, reduced savings in response to higher inflation and seasonal patterns. Deposit costs were very well-controlled, reflecting Truist's strong retail and commercial franchise and our enviable market share position. In addition, our lines of business and corporate treasury teams continued to deliver excellent execution against a thoughtful strategy to be attentive to client needs and client relationships while maximizing value outside of rate paid. As a result, interest-bearing cumulative deposit betas have been 21% thus far, well below our modeled assumptions. As the interest rate environment evolves, we'll continue to take a balanced approach to managing deposit growth and rate paid, particularly given our broad access to other forms of funding. Before I turn it over to Mike, I'd like to acknowledge and thank Daryl Bible. He has built a best-in-class finance function. He played a key essential role in the success of our merger, and he's really been incredibly supportive in helping Mike transition into the CFO role. Many of you in the investment community know Daryl well, and appreciate his knowledge and transparency, which will continue to be hallmarks of Truist going forward. I'm also excited to introduce Mike Maguire as our new CFO. Most recently, Mike led Truist Consumer Finance and Payments businesses including LightStream, Service Finance, Sheffield and Auto Finance. He was also responsible for our Enterprise Payment Strategy Group and Wholesale Payments businesses, including Treasury Solutions, Merchant Services and Commercial Card. Mike is a strategic thinker, a purpose-driven leader with an exceptional depth of experience across our enterprise and a deep understanding of how technology is shaping our operating environment. He's truly an industry thought leader in the fintech space. We'll certainly draw on this experience as Mike assumes his new role during this time of exciting transformation. So Mike, with that, I'm going to turn it over to you. Mike Maguire : Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I would also like to thank Daryl for his guidance and his support throughout my transition into the CFO role. I'm excited about the opportunity, and I'm confident that the transition will be seamless for all of our stakeholders. I also want to thank my teammates in the finance organization for welcoming me and for their support. We have a really talented team, and I look forward to working with all of them. For our analysts and investors, I'll be on the road soon, and hope to meet as many of you as possible. This is really a great opportunity, and I'm excited about helping take Truist to new heights. So moving to Slide 12, for the quarter, net interest income increased 10% sequentially to $3.8 billion as higher short-term interest rates and strong loan growth more than offset lower purchase accounting accretion. Core net interest income was up a strong 14%. Deposit costs remain well-controlled, reflecting the strength of our deposit franchise. Lower purchase accounting accretion was the result of elevated accretion in previous periods due to conversion activity and slowing prepays in the current period. Reported net interest margin increased 23 basis points, while core net interest margin increased 30 basis points, driven by similar trends as net interest income. Moving to Slide 13, fee income decreased $146 million or 6.5% sequentially. Insurance income decreased $100 million primarily due to seasonally lower property and casualty commissions. Investment banking and trading income decreased $33 million as lower fees from structured real estate, investment grade and high-yield bonds and syndicated and leveraged finance were partially offset by increased M&A fees. Wider credit spreads, tightening liquidity and general macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty are all contributing to slower activity levels. Despite these current headwinds, we continue to make strong strategic progress within Corporate and Investment Banking. Capital Markets revenue from non-corporate and investment banking clients is up 25% year-over-year as our commercial community bank, commercial real estate and wealth teammates continue to learn how to successfully partner with CIB to deliver strategic advice to our clients. Our lead table position has improved across most products, including equity capital markets, high yield, investment grade and syndicated and leveraged finance. Given the strategic progress, we intend to continue to take advantage of the challenging environment to invest in Truist Securities by selectively adding talent to drive long-term share gains as we've successfully done during previous market disruptions. Other income, excluding impacts from our non-qualified plan, decreased $17 million link quarter, primarily due to valuation-related marks. Compared to a year ago, other income decreased $81 million as a result of lower investment income and valuation marks on SBIC-related and other strategic investments. Turning to Slide 14, adjusted non-interest expense increased $83 million or 2.6% sequentially, reflecting forward-focused investments in talent and technology, as well as elevated operational losses. Professional fees and outside processing expense increased $34 million on an adjusted basis as we advanced critical projects, including investments in cybersecurity, contact center modernization, fraud detection and the build-out of our in-house payments capabilities. Other expense increased $28 million, primarily due to higher operational losses. Personnel expense increased $23 million on an adjusted basis, reflecting strategic and purposeful additions in technology, commercial community banking, CIB, consumer finance and wealth, as well as the BenefitMall acquisition. Compared to the third quarter of last year, adjusted non-interest expense only increased 2%. This modest increase was driven by higher operational losses and investment spend, which were partially offset by merger-related cost savings in software and net occupancy expense. Overall, we continue to focus on generating expense reductions in certain areas to fund longer-term investments in talent and technology and to generate ongoing operating leverage. As an example, we believe recent technology investments to enhance identity authentication, fraud detection, among other factors, will mitigate operational losses. Also, with the conversion behind us, we have additional flexibility to rationalize certain businesses such as mortgage, where capacity exceeds demand. Lastly, we have our final leg of data center-related technology savings that is expected to materialize throughout the fourth quarter. Below the line, our third quarter results also reflected an effective tax rate of 18.2% down from 19.5% in the second quarter primarily due to discrete tax benefits arising from final true-ups to our 2021 tax return. We continue to expect a normal effective tax rate to be 20% which translates to 21% on a fully taxable equivalent basis. Moving to Slide 15, asset quality continues to be excellent, reflecting our prudent risk culture and diverse portfolio. Leading credit indicators remain strong. Non-performing loans decreased 1 basis point and loans 30 to 89 days past due decreased 7 basis points. Net charge-offs remained benign at 27 basis points, up 5 basis points from the prior quarter, primarily due to normalizing trends and seasonality in certain consumer portfolios. Our total allowance increased $18 million to support our loan growth and the ALLL ratio decreased 4 basis points due to strong portfolio performance and growth in higher-quality loans, partially offset by a moderately slower economic outlook. Moving on to Slide 16, our CET1 ratio decreased from 9.2% to 9.1% as we deployed capital to support strong loan growth and to complete the BenefitMall acquisition. We also increased the dividend 8% to $0.52 per share beginning in the third quarter, reflecting our confidence in our improving earnings trajectory. Overall, our capital position remains strong in light of our risk and profitability profile, and we maintain a strong liquidity position with access to multiple sources of funding for incremental loan growth. Turning now to Slide 17, I'll next outline the strategic rationale and financial impact of two recently announced insurance acquisitions. First, BenefitMall closed on September 1, providing a scaled entry into wholesale employee benefits and filling one of the remaining strategic gaps in our capability set. BenefitMall is expected to add $160 million of annual revenue at an initial EBITDA margin in the mid-20% that will build to the mid-30% over time as synergies are realized. The transaction also has potential earn benefits within Truist Insurance by supporting our brokers at McGriff, our retail insurance business and also outside Truist Insurance with our corporate and commercial clients. We also recently announced the acquisition of BankDirect Capital Finance. Strategically, BankDirect effectively doubles our premium finance business, broadens our capabilities to include life insurance and expands our West Coast presence. Pro forma, we estimate Truist Insurance Holdings will be the number two premium finance player in the market after this deal closes later this quarter. BankDirect brings with it a $3.2 billion loan portfolio with strong projected growth, attractive profitability, limited credit risk and short duration. While both acquisitions are expected to be dilutive initially, we believe they are strategic and financially attractive over the long run. So, I'll now provide new guidance for the fourth quarter. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect a mid double-digit basis point increase in both our core and reported net interest margin due to benefits from the recent rate hikes and a projected 75 basis point hike in November. Fees will rebound sequentially, driven by insurance income improving due to seasonality, solid organic growth and the full impact of the BenefitMall acquisition. The extent to which investment banking fees improve will be dictated by levels of capital markets activity. Adjusted expenses are anticipated to increase approximately 1% as the increase to minimum wage, investments and revenue-producing businesses and technology and acquisitions are partially offset by the impacts of cost savings. Putting these pieces all together, we expect adjusted PPNR to grow approximately 10% with some upside based on the realization of investment banking pipelines. Based on our year-to-date results and fourth quarter expectations, we are on track to achieve positive operating leverage for the full year. We remain consistent with our expectations that the net charge-off ratio will be between 25 and 35 basis points for the full year due to our performance year-to-date and normalizing trends across our loan portfolio. With that, I will turn it back to Bill to conclude. Bill Rogers : Great. Thank you, Mike. Continuing to our strategic shift on Slide 18. Earlier this year, I expressed my view that the first quarter was a strategic and financial turning point for Truist. Our third quarter results build upon the second quarter progress even as market conditions diminished overall PPNR trajectory, progress is real and it's palpable. We've made significant progress in our digital and technology areas as evidenced by improving mobile app ratings and enhanced client experience within treasury and payments and many other new features and capabilities that strengthen the financial confidence of our clients. Speed to answer in our care centers is now well below our initial service level agreements and more investment will improve the efficiency as well. Loan production in the third quarter was highest it's been at Truist, up 8% compared to the second quarter. Branch loan and deposit production are up a solid 14% and 20% like quarter, respectively, as teammates become more confident with processes and systems, but also improve solutions and capabilities. IRM referrals to our wealth businesses increased 17% sequentially and the amount of income generated from IRM referrals by our commercial community bank was the second highest ever both highlighting the power of our advice-driven and client-centric model. Our brand awareness was up almost 400 basis points in the third quarter while our peers were flat to down. And our brand consideration which measures whether consumers are giving Truist a serious thought was 210 basis points and ranks us fifth highest in our markets, having only been alive for that brand for three years. Almost all of our client satisfaction scores are ascending and in many cases, at their highest levels since we become Truist. The financial benefits of this momentum are being realized and will be increasingly visible as market conditions normalize and merger-related expense noise abates. To conclude, Truist is on the right path, and I'm highly optimistic about our ability to realize our significant post-integration potential which is clearly summarized in our investment thesis on Slide 19. Strategically, we have shifted from execution to execution, transformation and growth. We're investing in digital and technology as we reduce cost, including operational losses. We're simplifying our processes and operations, and we're acting on our purpose each and every day with a singular goal of improving our client experience. We're also intensely focused on capturing the significant integrated relationship management and revenue synergy potential we have as it's squarely in the center of building better lives for our clients. These shifts in activities do not require incremental risk appetite or capital, just execution and focus, both of which lie within our sphere of control. Externally, while we believe the economy is generally healthy, persistent high inflation and a rapid tightening of monetary policy, combined with geopolitical tensions, have reduced visibility and increased uncertainty as we move into 2023. Truist is nevertheless well-positioned across a broad range of economic outcomes given our advice-oriented model for clients, conservative credit culture, diverse business mix, and our strong capital position relative to our risk profile and our significant performance momentum as we continue the shift from integration to execution and growth. Ankur, let me turn it back over to you for Q&A. Ankur Vyas : Thanks, Bill. Jake, at this time, if you don't mind, will you please explain how our listeners can will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session. As you do that, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary question and one follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will begin with Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Bill, you mentioned that you guys had positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis of 260 basis points. Can you give us some color what you're thinking about -- and when you look at adjusted positive operating leverage for the next 12 months, what do you think that could come in at? Bill Rogers : Yes. I think well obviously for the balance of the year, we talked about this as well, but I think we'll have positive operating leverage for the year. As we look into 2023, obviously, there are a lot of puts and takes. There's a lot of uncertainty headed into that. But positive operating leverage is going to be a core tenet of what we do. So if we look at the revenue potential in terms of the loan growth and deposit production we've had, being able to capitalize on those opportunities with those clients as we move forward, so even if the economy slows down a bit, we still have a lot of momentum in that area. We've got great strength in our insurance business. We've got great strength in our overall capital markets business. Wealth has been building its capability. So, we've got a lot of engines and tailwind from that side. And then, we've got a lot of tailwind on the cost sides. So, we'll complete the bulk of the merger cost saves at the end of this year. But heading into next year is really where we get to leverage all those. If you think about the concept of you put two things together, now you make those two things more efficient. So those opportunities for digitization and automation, we're consolidating our card platform. All the things that will continue on in terms of cost saves. So, I'm just -- I am not giving you specific guidance on operating leverage for the year other than to say that will be a core tenet and component of how we plan for the future. Gerard Cassidy : And then as a follow-up question, you pointed out that the deposit beta was 21% on a cumulative basis and then 14% without the brokered CDs. And that was below your models. Two things, can you tell us what your model would have suggested the deposit beta would have been? And then second, using the forward curve, where do you think you end up with a final cumulative deposit beta? Mike Maguire : This is Mike, I'm happy to take that one. So, you're right, we've been very pleased by the performance of the deposit portfolio so far at 21%. I think we said earlier this year, we expected betas to be closer to 30% as we get to the second half of the year. We still expect that to be the case by year-end. In terms of a terminal beta, very, very hard to tell, we've seen probably some lag given the rate at which rates have increased. And so, we do expect there to be some catch-up, but whether or not it will be to the tune of the previous cycle in the mid-30s or beyond, we'll observe that together. Operator : We'll move to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Just want to ask a question on funding and deposits. You guys are showing fairly good resiliency as is the industry. Just give a little more context of what you're expecting to see in terms of mix shift and also your thoughts. It looked like you did add a bunch of wholesale borrowings relative to your incremental cost of funding through deposits. So just think -- help us think about how you're thinking about liability structure and deposit growth. Mike Maguire : Ken, it's Mike, I'll start here as well. So again, we have been very pleased from the deposit perspective with only a sequential decrease of 1%. And so very pleased by how the balances are hanging in there. We are expecting, I think, over the near term, to continue to have some pressure on deposits, as well as some pressure on mix. We did see some shift from DDA into interest-bearing. That's been a moderate shift so far, and we're still well above levels that we experienced pre-COVID. But we are beginning to see that shift take place. In terms of short-term borrowings, you're right, we are accessing brokered markets. We are accessing short-term markets and do expect that to continue over the intermediate term. But don't expect that to shift significantly. As we think about funding, loan growth for one has been very, very high. So far year-to-date, we do expect loan growth to moderate somewhat, which should alleviate some of that gap. But between the deposit balance levels, between leveraging some of the securities portfolio running off to the tune of $10 billion to $15 billion per year, accessing some of the wholesale markets, which is a pretty wide array of tools and even thinking about the capital markets, we feel really good about our funding capability. Bill Rogers : And Ken, maybe just to add to that in terms of the first part of the question, too, is just the strength of our deposit franchise. It's pretty granular, 42% under $250,000. We've got really good market share. But what we're seeing, I talked about this in my prepared comments, our production's really strong. Truist One has been really successful. Our teammates have really responded, clients and both new clients and existing clients have really responded, investments in treasury and payments. So, we're leaning into this in terms of our own capabilities from the deposit production side. And then for the fourth quarter, remember, the third quarter has got some seasonality in things like public funds, for example, where that's a strong area for us. So, I think we'll be sort of stable in the fourth quarter. And then Mike talked, I think, eloquently about the funding side. Ken Usdin : And just one quick follow-up, just can you just give us a sense of where you're reinvesting the cash flows that are going back into the securities portfolio versus what's rolling off? Mike Maguire : Yes, I mean the cash flow that's coming off is being invested in the loan portfolio. There's de minimis investing to support our CRA efforts, but the bulk of the cash flow is being invested in loans. Bill Rogers : The great news is we have something to deploy it towards, which is perfect. Mike Maguire : Yes. Operator : Moving on to Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Bill, you saw -- I saw a nice sequential growth and it's likely to continue to grow into 4Q given your outlook plus the asset balance -- as a sense of balance sheet. So I guess, based on your comments on to Gerard of betas in the mid-30s or maybe a little bit higher, do you think you can continue to grow NII as a -- on a sequential basis as we look ahead over the next few quarters, adjusted for seasonal impacts? And maybe just talk about some of the puts and takes involved in that. Bill Rogers : Michael, I'll let you start, and I'll talk about that as well. Mike Maguire : Yes, Ryan, you're right. I mean, look, we've got a really good trajectory going into Q4 with the NIM, as we mentioned in our guide, expected to increase 15 or so basis points. Look, as long as rates continue to increase, we expect to continue to see some NIM expansion. At some point, I think we all expect to achieve this terminal policy rate and whether it's higher longer or begins to decline, we'll see. From an NII perspective, we'll obviously benefit from that NIM expansion over that period. And then I think as NIMs begin to feel some pressure, we feel good again today. We've got really nice earning asset growth. We expect that to moderate, but should offset any impact over the intermediate term of the decline in NIM. We see '23 from a rates perspective as a relatively stable period. Bill Rogers : To Mike's point, a lot of it also depend on loan growth and what we see going into next year, really positive momentum through this quarter, which I think will continue into the fourth quarter. It all for -- it's a little murkier as we head into next year, but I like the momentum and the production and the pipelines and the relevance and the competitiveness of our franchise right now from that standpoint. Ryan Nash : Bill, maybe a bigger picture question for me. So, I think at a recent conference, you highlighted that you expected expenses to grow in '23, which makes sense given you've done a handful of deals as pressure from inflation. However, when we think back on the drivers of the merger, we were talking about best-in-class growth, improving returns. And I know we've now made the shift to offense. But when I speak to investors, I get the sense I feel we're not quite there yet. So while I know you're not giving '23 guidance. What do we need to see for this to begin to come through, whether it's operating leverage or better-than-peer expense growth? And just how are you measuring the success of all these efforts? Bill Rogers : Yes, I think overall, I mean, we've talked about this. It's the measurement of can we grow revenue long term over time and PPNR faster and relative to our market opportunities. And I think that opportunity sits squarely in front of us. I think if I look at the things that contribute to that in the areas of production, like loan production, AUM production, deposit production, I'd argue, actually, we're sort of getting to sort of a peak kind of performance in those areas. As it relates to the expense side, and this stuff just doesn't go quarter-to-quarter. You just -- they're going to have different levels of investment. We've made a conscious decision. And while I'll acknowledge, I'm cranky on the operating losses side. So operational losses, I think we've got some opportunity there. I see some improvements coming, but that has been longer and taken longer than I had anticipated, but we're consciously investing in some areas. So we're consciously investing in investment banking and wealth and insurance. And you know us well. I mean we've got a good track record here. When times are a little bumpy and the opportunity is there, we've taken advantage of it, and that's proven to be really, really smart investments on our standpoint. So, we're sort of unabashed about that, and that has a quarter-to-quarter implication to it. And I just have to absorb it and take it because I'm confident that we're doing the things that will create better opportunity for us and allow us to gain share over time. So long answer to a short direct question, I think we can grow disproportionately over time. It just won't look like that quarter-to-quarter. And I think look at the production, look at the capabilities that we're creating today, and I'm confident in manifesting those towards the future. Operator : And Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley has the next question. Betsy Graseck : It's Betsy. I wanted to just dig into a couple of things, one is on loan growth. It's been really strong. And I heard the comments around how you're funding it and how you're thinking about driving that from here. I wanted to get a little bit of an understanding on how you're thinking about the quality of the book relative to its ability to absorb this interest rate hike. So obviously, we've had about 300 basis points so far. We're going to get at least another 150-plus over the next quarter or so. And how are you assessing your borrower's ability to pay you back? Are we all too worried about credit risk? I know you gave the guide for the full year NCOs, which I'm wondering why not having -- have brought that down given the performance you've had to date. So just a few questions on credit from that perspective. Bill Rogers : Yes, I'll start, Betsy, if it can also turn it over to Clarke, he's itching to get in and talk about credit quality and the quality of the portfolio and what we put on the books. We've not diminished our commitment to credit quality. We're taking our clients through the appropriate stress testing process. I mean we're underwriting at new rates and new environments. So, I think our production just reflects our just competitiveness. I mean our ability to win more size and relevance with our clients. And then you see that reflected right now in our reserve, particularly on the wholesale side. The quality actually is -- might argue might be improving. So Clarke, why don't you embellish that, if you would? Clarke Starnes : Yes, thanks, Bill, and I agree with you. We're very careful in our underwriting right now. So we're looking obviously at rate shock and the ability to absorb that. We're looking at other things like pricing power and their margins, given supply and input costs and inflation, looking at clients' investment decisions, how they're deploying capital, their liquidity, their balance sheet and just overall strength. So, we feel really good about the core underwriting. In fact, I would tell you for the quarter, about 95% of our C&I production was investment grade or near investment grade credit, so really high quality there. And as far as our NCO guidance for the full year, we feel really good about where we are. But remember, we normalize as we go into the fourth quarter from a consumer standpoint and we have the seasonal impact. So that's really truly the consumer side that may increase losses on. Betsy Graseck : And then just digging in a little bit on the commercial side on this theme, can you remind us how you are thinking about your Shared National Credit exposure, what that is, leverage lending? I know legacy SunTrust had a bigger skew in their business model to that, but with the combined organization, it's been reduced a bit as a percentage of total. So just give us a sense as to how big those books are today, how they're trending, and how much capacity you have to lean in with the bigger balance with the bigger balance with the bigger balance with the bigger balance sheet you've got now. Bill Rogers : Yes, Clarke, why don't you take that? Clarke Starnes : Yes, maybe I'll start it, Bill. First, from an SNC standpoint, we're in really good shape. We just went through the exam and had great results. I feel very good about that. We have about $59 billion in outstandings in our SNC book. So it's about 19% of our balances, and that's been fairly steady or so. So, it's a very diversified book. We feel really good about that. As far as our leveraged finance book, just remember, that's about 7% of our total book; however, over half of that is 55% investment-grade clients. So really 3% would be more in the sponsored or non-investment grade side. That book's performing extremely well today. So minimal NPLs, we've had about 9 basis points of losses and are criticized are in good shape. So while there's been disruption and challenges in the market, our overall performance has been very, very good. Bill Rogers : I think you characterized it right that as part of the benefits of the merger is the diversification of that portfolio by definition of the denominator. So, we haven't grown it in proportion to the increase in the size of our business, and it's well-diversified. Leverage portfolio is well diversified. Exposures are not significant to any one person. And it's about 50% sponsors and about 50% on us. So this is a business that supports our client base, and it's categorized as leverage, but it's really supporting the growth in our client base and consistent with our strategy of helping our clients with their business life cycles. I mean I think -- so it's a little bit different and a little more focused on an on-us component. Operator : Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo will have our next question. Mike Mayo : I'll continue my analogy with your franchise as a core. I mean, you're clearly in the country's sweet spot for population growth. I mean I keep meeting more of investing clients that have moved to New York to Florida permanently, entire firms. And -- so you're certainly in the sweet spot. You did mention momentum and certainly NII and loan growth and how you're going from defense to offense. So I get it. But then I hear, Bill, your target for positive operating leverage of over 0%. It just seems like with a target like that, you're aiming for the Charlotte Motor Speedway instead of Indianapolis 500, right? It seems like -- and this is at a time when your peers are showing much greater positive operating leverage and they don't have this unique in-market merger with these incredible synergies that are possible. So I know you're not giving too much guidance for next year right now, but can you just talk about whatever headwinds may be going away? You talk about the operational losses. It seems like you're doing a lot for your customers. You're making them whole more than others perhaps. You're doing a lot for your employees. You're raising what they get paid, but I'm just thinking about the shareholders here. And so what are some of the headwinds that may or may not go away? And what are some of the tailwinds that you think we'll see more of? Bill Rogers : Yes, thanks, Mike. And we'll continue to keep the corvette network going, I guess. But if we define speed as related to how are you doing against your markets, I look at the loan deposit AUM, the production side. And I'd say we're actually at a really good high rate of speed. And I'd say we're at our speed that reflects the opportunity that sits in our market. So if we define it that way, if we define the opportunity, which I 100% agree with is to have improved positive operating leverage overtime and increased revenue and PPNR growth. We also have to invest to make that happen. So we like you to see the same things that you're seeing in our markets, and we've got to make sure that we invest in those. And again, I wish it sort of balanced out quarter-to-quarter. It just doesn't. So the opportunities for us to invest right now, and I think gain share long term in areas I mentioned before, like investment banking, like insurance, like wealth, we're just going to do that. And I think that's going to have a good long-term impact for us. You've seen this before, you've seen this movie and you know how well it ends for us. So we know how to do this. So I'm very confident on that side. And then the part about the operational losses and the commitments that we made to our clients, those are also good long-term decisions. I mean, look, we were in the middle of a merger. We gave the benefit of the doubt to a client. Whenever there was a benefit of a doubt, I think long term, that's going to create sustainable long-term relationships and the same thing with teammates. Increasing minimum wage is fantastic for shareholders. I cited some of the stats that we're seeing already an improved turnover and improved vacancy rates. I didn't mention the care center. We're seeing that as well. So long term, that's going to have a tremendous benefit for our shareholders, as well as our teammates. So I'm confident. I think we're materializing the things that we want to have. It's just not coming in quarter-to-quarter as I'd like. It's not as matched as I'd like. There are some pesky things that I think will come down, and I'm already seeing that at the end of the quarter and the first of this quarter in terms of operational losses. So, we can have a cleaner more focused, easier to understand and easier to have the production and those things result in the kind of PPNR growth that I think we're able to do long term. Mike Mayo : So a follow-up, even if I can see the speed part, I guess, the cost of gas is quite high, and maybe, Mike, from your perspective, coming into the CFO spot, things that you might be able to do to control the expenses, as Bill was alluding to. Mike Maguire : Yes, Mike, good morning and happy to react to that. I mean, I think, first and foremost, still, at this point, absorbing and coming in and meeting the team, getting a sense for where we are. Look, Bill made some great points. I don't come to the table with some predefined view or silver bullet as it relates to these things. The headwinds that Bill talked about, minimum wage, inflation, some of the investments that we're prioritizing, they're important. But then again, we have some great tailwinds as well, whether it'd be realizing the benefits of the savings. I think there's some benefit from an automation perspective, some work we're doing that's in more nascent phase, and then just overall productivity. I mean, look, if we -- I think we've got a great track record in terms of being able to manage expense. If and when that becomes a more important priority based on market conditions, but no, I think Bill said it well, Mike. Operator : Now, we'll move to our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess one follow-up first for Clarke on the reserves, and Clarke, apologies if I missed it, but can you remind us what's the base case of the weighted unemployment rate that's baked into your reserving at the end of the quarter? And I guess, as we think about sort of what the next 12 months could look like, what are the other one or two big inputs that could change the reserving outlook other than unemployment? Clarke Starnes : That's a great question. In our base case, which we wait at 40%, we have unemployment going up to 4% and then going higher into the mid-4s as we go into '23 and beyond. So clearly, a little more pessimistic on as we ran the reserves this quarter. I would say for us, other big drivers would be a housing HPI would be another input there in our models, and you've already mentioned GDP. So from our standpoint, the big driver for us would be the scenario weighting and the scenario outlook would have the biggest impact on our reserves, obviously, versus other things like our mix of production and our overall portfolio performance. But right now, I think the scenario outlook would be the biggest driver. Ebrahim Poonawala : And I guess just one follow-up, Bill, for you. As we look at the next stage, I mean, obviously, BB&T, SunTrust history of acquisitions, a lot of your peers might be struggling in terms of deposit, deposit pricing, given what the fed might be doing. Talk to us in terms of as we look forward to the next year or two, appetite for bank M&A extending the franchise and how you think about that? Bill Rogers : Yes. I mean right now, we have the best franchise to invest in and it's called Truist. And that's where our focus is and that's where our opportunity is. And ability to expand and create more capacity within our existing markets is really our primary focus right now. Operator : We'll move on to Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Can you guys talk about the openness to maybe some restructuring of the securities portfolio? I mean obviously, rates have gone up a lot and the yields on your current book are a lot lower. So it would cost a lot to restructure a big part of it, but there might be some opportunities here and there as you think about the strong capital generation and what to use the capital for? Mike Maguire : Matt, it's Mike, good morning and happy to react to that. As of this moment, there are no plans to restructure the securities portfolio. I think I mentioned that we do view the portfolio as a tool for funding loan growth. As that continues, it's creating cash flow of approximately $10 million to $15 million per year. Bill Rogers : Yes, and Matt, I mean, today, we -- today, we're redeploying it into the growth in our business, and you acknowledge that would be very expensive. And what we try to do is look at that securities portfolio over time. And so we're going to take that cash flow. And right now, we've got great opportunities to reinvest it and not take a capital hit for the securities portfolio. I'd rather use that capital to invest in our business. Matt O'Connor: And then just separately, you had mentioned earlier some mix shift out of auto and mortgage. Can you frame how much you expect that to be over time? And then maybe you mentioned it, but just where is the mix shift going if it's out of mortgage and auto? What are you leaning into? Bill Rogers : Yes, Matt, it's just basically sort of an overall return focus and make sure that we're maximizing our capital. As we see some of the returns in the mortgage business and the auto business being a little more stretched. We want to make sure we're serving our clients, and we're doing a great job in doing that. But by the same token, we're seeing the other opportunities in our commercial portfolio and our consumer portfolio. So we just want to get the right balance and a return focus versus we've never been sort of the growth for growth's sake. We want to be return-oriented. We want to maximize the return on the capital that we're investing in the portfolio. Ankur Vyas : Jake, I think we've got time for one more question. Operator : And that final question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS. Erika Najarian : I just I had one follow-up question, Bill. You got asked this several times, but I just wanted to make sure your shareholders understood what you were saying. You've been asked a lot about delivering operating leverage. At the same time, dislocation creates opportunity. And is this also a sort of once-in-a-cycle help from rates, right, in terms of operating leverage, helping the denominator? So is the message here really that you are going to always try to deliver positive operating leverage as a way of Truist Life, but you're seeing opportunities to invest today? And as we think about the tougher part of the cycle, whether we fall into a recession next year, and we don't have rate hikes helping. Your investments today are going to help Truist deliver above-average PPNR over a longer period of time other than just now when you're getting a lot of help from rates? Bill Rogers : I think that's really well stated, and I wish I had stated it as well as your question. So no, I think that's exactly right. And as I mentioned, I mean positive operating leverage will be a hallmark of what we do. So that is -- that's core and focus of what we do. We just can't be wed to that quarter-to-quarter when we see an opportunity. So we're going to have positive operating leverage this year. It will be a little less than we'd hoped for six months ago, but we're investing that I think is going to create not only better operating leverage, but more importantly, strong PPNR growth for the future. And we just have to make sure that we're, for the benefit of our shareholders, thinking long term and thinking about this incredible opportunity that sits in front of us and maximizing our ability to capitalize on it. So I think you stated actually quite well. Erika Najarian : And my last question is for Clarke. Thank you so much for sharing that data on your ACL. And just in terms of how CECL works, if we do hit a 4% unemployment rate, which is your base case, does that mean that you have to then wait worse scenarios in that 4%? In other words, do you say, okay, we hit 4%, that's our base case. We don't have to build reserves further, or does the model say, oh we're at 4%, it could get worse, so we now need to build for something worse than 4%? Clarke Starnes : Great question. I would say, keep in mind that we run multiple scenarios. So we have our base case, which I described, but we also run a much more severe set of downside scenarios. And as we look forward, those scenarios get worse as well as even if the baseline deteriorates some additionally. So we weigh all of that, and we look at it each quarter. And so, even if the baseline is at one place, the downside scenarios may be more and would be more severe. So, we're going to look at all of that and decide how we weigh all of those factors and determine the allowance. And so yes, I mean, the downside scenario could push it even further even if the baseline is going up. Ankur Vyas : All right, thank you, Erica. That completes our earnings call. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team. Thank you for your interest in Truist. We hope you have a great day. Jake, you may now disconnect the call. Operator : Very well. Once again, everyone, this does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

The only authorized live and archived webcast are located on our website. With that, let me now turn it over to Bill. Bill Rogers : Thanks, Ankur. Good morning, everybody and Happy New Year. Thank you for joining our call today. Truist delivered a strong finish to a pivotal and purposeful year. We completed our final integration and decommissioning activities and incurred the final set of merger-related costs. Adjusted PPNR grew a strong 12% sequentially, ahead of our guidance and helped us deliver on our commitment for positive operating leverage for the full year. We will cover the details on the quarter\u2019s results throughout the presentation and we will start with our purpose, the foundation of our company on Slide 4. Truist is a purpose-driven company dedicated to inspiring and building better lives and communities. Our purpose is the foundation for our success as a company that drives performance and defines how we do business everyday. Slide 5 highlights many examples of how we activated our purpose in 2022. For our clients, our measurement is to provide distinctive, secure and successful experiences through touch and technology. We achieved a major milestone along that journey with the launch of Truist One Banking, our differentiated product suite that reimagines everyday banking and includes two new accounts that eliminate overdraft fees and provide greater access to credit. These accounts meaningfully advance financial inclusion in our communities and we are very encouraged by the positive reception they have received from new and existing clients alike. Based on August through December data, which reflects Truist One, branch checking production increased 10% from a year ago period and we achieved this result despite having around 400 fewer branches. The Truist One suite now also includes our new cash reserve deposit base credit line up to $750, which launched in mid-December and expands our commitment to our clients and communities. Our ability to innovate at the intersection of touch and technology was greatly enhanced by the opening of our new innovation and technology center, which brings our cross-functional teams together with clients and large tech companies to reimagine banking experiences for everyone. We have already realized the benefits of the ITC as Truist One Banking and the new digital and hybrid investment capabilities launched throughout the year were all co-created client with clients and our client journey rooms. We also continued to deliver on our mission for our teammates. In October, we took a bold step to improve the lives of our teammates by raising our minimum wage to $22 an hour. In the 3 months since this took effect, we have experienced improved teammate recruitment, retention, lower turnover expenses, better execution and an all-around better client experience. We also enhanced our total rewards program to include an employee stock purchase program to further align our teammates\u2019 interest with those of our shareholders. As a company that champions diversity, equity and inclusion, we achieved our goal to increase ethnically diverse representation in senior leadership roles a year early with aspirations for further progress. Finally, Truist has made a significant impact on the communities we serve by meeting and in some categories, exceeding our $60 billion community benefits plan. Our first inspirational commitment is Truist and one that has served as a framework for similar plans across the industry. The execution of this plan was a testament to our purpose of building better lives and communities by elevating low and moderate income and minority communities through material support for affordable housing, non-profit, small business and community development lending. In summary, we are delivering on our purpose and the significance of what our teammates have accomplished is just outstanding. We will continue to raise the bar and I look forward to the year ahead as we actualize our purpose, advance integrated relationship management, positively impact clients and communities through continued investment in touch and technology and make Truist an even better place to work. Now turning to Slide 7, selected items for the quarter totaled $170 million pre-tax and included our final charges related to the MOE. Now that our integration activities are complete, MOE costs will exit our run-rate going forward. This is a positive development for shareholders that underscores our pivot to execution and will simplify our narrative, enhance earnings quality and improve capital generation. Turning to our fourth quarter performance highlights on Slide 8. Truist delivered strong fourth quarter earnings of $1.6 billion or $1.20 per share on a reported basis. Adjusted earnings totaled $1.7 billion or $1.30 per share, up 5% sequentially as strong PPNR growth was partially offset by higher provision expense. Adjusted ROTCE was 30% and even excluding AOCI, was 20%. Both data points are very strong. Net interest income grew 7% to $4 billion, a new high for Truist, supported by strong loan growth and significant margin expansion resulted from higher short-term rates and well-controlled deposit costs. Fee income rebounded 6%, primarily due to insurance seasonality of full quarter of benefit mall results and investment banking. Adjusted expenses increased sequentially, mostly as expected as the impacts of higher minimum wage, acquisitions and targeted investments were partially offset by the final leg of some of our cost saving efforts. Together, these factors drove a 12% increase in adjusted PPNR exceeding our guidance. This performance also resulted in 370 basis points of adjusted operating leverage relative to the fourth quarter of 2021, our strongest operating leverage results for the year. Our adjusted efficiency ratio was 54.2%, our best quarterly performance at Truist thus far. Asset quality remains strong and the sequential increase in provision expense primarily reflects moderately slower economic assumptions. We also deployed 10 basis points of capital as a result of strong organic loan growth and the BankDirect acquisition. Our capital position remains strong relative to our risk and profitability profile and we remain confident in our ability to withstand and outperform in a range of economic scenarios. Turning to our full year highlights on Slide 9. GAAP EPS was relatively stable year-over-year as significantly lower merger-related costs were offset by higher and more normal provision levels. Adjusted EPS declined 10% year-over-year, a solid 4.4% adjusted PPNR growth, was more than offset by the $1.6 billion increase in the loan loss provision expense. Importantly, however, we delivered 60 basis points of adjusted and 680 basis points of GAAP operating leverage for the full year, which was a primary metric to which we hold ourselves accountable to in 2022. This was our first year of operating leverage as Truist and it establishes a firm foundation, from which we can accelerate as we head into 2023. Turning to Slide 10, digital engagement rose steadily through 2022 as a result of changing client preferences and our improved agility as Truist. We experienced strong growth in digital transactions and Zelle, in particular, as transaction volume increased 42% since the beginning of the year. Zelle continues to represent an increasing percentage of our overall transaction mix and highlights the importance of continuing to invest in money movement capabilities. Our agility and responsiveness have improved tremendously since we have migrated to one digital platform built in the cloud, resulting in better client experiences. We delivered 3x as many production releases across retail, business and wealth in 2022 as we did in 2021. And as a result, our mobile app was rated at an average of 4.7 stars on Android and iOS at year end, up materially from a year ago. We introduced many new digital capabilities and solutions to clients in 2022 from Truist One Banking, Truist Assist and expanded digital investment capabilities, some of which are highlighted on the right side of the slide. In 2023, our goal is to more fully activate those capabilities with our clients to improve acquisition, retention and reduce cost. In addition to enhance digital capabilities for our clients, our digital and technology team successfully completed the largest bank merger in 15 years, decommissioned three data centers, successfully piloted a new deposit product on a next-gen real-time cloud-based core, enhanced credit decisioning and underwriting across certain consumer lending platforms and upgraded our contact center technology stack and completed a 5G network and branch WiFi pilot program. We have a great digital and technology team and they have been battle tested and have demonstrated incredible agility in responding to client needs during the integration period while also keeping their eyes on the future. Turning to loans and leases on Slide 11, average loan balances increased a strong $11.3 billion or 3.6% sequentially, approximately 20% of which came from the BankDirect acquisition. The improved loan growth we have experienced in recent quarters reflects our shift to execution and Truist\u2019s greater competitiveness for clients due to our size and capabilities as well as broader industry trends. C&I grew $7.2 billion or 4.7% overall and increased 3.2%, excluding BankDirect, as balances increased across most CIB industry verticals and product groups and CCB. As in recent quarters, growth continues to be strong within our Asset Finance Group as we continue to build that business with more talent, product capabilities and larger balance sheet. Macro trends such as supply chain management, infrastructure spending, inflation and choppy capital markets are also supporting growth here. CIB delivered growth across most industry verticals due to a combination of new client acquisition, uptiering our position with existing clients, acquisition activity and business-as-usual liquidity management. Commercial Community Bank C&I balances grew 3.7%, reflecting the strength of our markets and our team\u2019s focus on execution. Residential mortgage balances increased $3 billion or 5% sequentially due to previous correspondent channel production and lower prepayments. Excluding mortgage, consumer and card balances decreased on an end-of-period basis, primarily reflecting continued runoff in our student loan portfolio as well as our decision to pivot away from lower return portfolios such as prime auto. At the same time, we continue to invest in higher return consumer finance businesses, such as Service Finance, LightStream and Sheffield. Service Finance continues to grow and ended the year with over $3 billion worth of loans, ahead of high expectations at the time of the acquisition. Going forward, loan growth will moderate from the robust levels in 2022 as clients respond to the impact of higher rates, high inflation and a slowing economy. In addition, we also expect growth in residential mortgage and prime auto to continue to slow as we focus our capital on higher return opportunities. Truist remains well positioned to advise clients across a range of economic scenarios given our broad capability, talented teammates and increased capacity post-integration. Now turning to deposits on Slide 12. Average deposit balances decreased 1.6% sequentially as effects of tighter monetary policy, inflation and higher rate alternatives continue to weigh on balances. Deposit costs remained well controlled, reflecting the strength of our deposit franchise and our strategy to be attentive to client needs and relationships while maximizing value outside of rate paid. During the fourth quarter, interest-bearing deposit costs increased 52 basis points, contributing to a cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta of 27%, thus far. As the interest rate environment evolves, we will continue to take a balanced approach to maintaining and managing deposit growth and rate paid giving our broad access to alternative forms of funding. Our continued rollout of Truist One and ongoing investments in treasury and payments will be key areas of focus going forward as we look to acquire new and deepen existing relationships and maximize high-quality deposit growth. Now with that, let me turn it over to Mike. Mike Maguire : Great. Thank you, Bill and good morning everyone. I am going to begin on Slide 13. For the quarter, taxable equivalent net interest income rose a very strong 7% to $4 billion, primarily due to ongoing margin expansion and strong loan growth. Deposit costs were well controlled and reflect the strength of our deposit franchise. Purchase accounting accretion decreased $19 million and is expected to continue to gradually diminish. Reported net interest margin increased 13 basis points and core net interest margin improved 15 basis points as a result of higher short-term interest rates alongside well-controlled deposit costs. Overall, we maintain a balanced approach to managing interest rate risk, maintaining modest upside to higher short-term interest rates while having some downside protection when and if interest rates begin to decline. Looking to Slide 14, fee income rebounded during the quarter, increasing $125 million or 6% sequentially. The improvement was largely attributable to seasonality and insurance and the BenefitMall acquisition as well as higher investment banking and lending-related fee income. Insurance income increased $41 million, largely due to seasonality and a full quarter of BenefitMall results. Organic revenue for the full year grew 7% driven by a firm pricing environment, new business and strong retention. Investment banking and trading income increased $35 million as higher investment banking fees and strong core trading results in the quarter were partially offset by negative impacts from CVA/DVA. For the full year, investment banking income declined 37%, which we believe compares favorably to overall industry fee performance as the partnership between CIB and other lines of business continues to grow and earn momentum builds. Strategic hiring within CIB over the past 2 years has also led to improved lead table standards. Fee income declined 4% compared to a year ago, primarily driven by declines in market-sensitive businesses such as investment banking, wealth and mortgage and partially offset by organic and inorganic growth in insurance. Overdraft fees also declined from approximately $150 million in 4Q \u201821 to approximately $120 million in 4Q \u201822 as a result of the actions we took last year to eliminate a host of overdraft-related fees and the continued introduction of Truist One Banking to new existing clients. We expect overdraft fees to decline another 40% as we move from year end 2022 to year end 2024. While fee income remains below its potential, we are optimistic that our investments in key areas such as insurance, investment banking and wealth will payoff as markets normalize and our IRM execution continues to progress. Turning to Slide 15, reported non-interest expense increased $109 million or 3% sequentially. Merger and restructuring costs rose $18 million linked quarter and exceeded our October guide by $70 million due to higher-than-expected restructuring charges related to planned facility and branch reductions that will occur in 2023. These were business-as-usual decisions unrelated to the MOE and have solid financial returns. As Bill indicated, we will have no more restructuring charges or incremental operating expenses related to the MOE going forward. We would anticipate restructuring costs related to prior acquisition activity and other BAU expense normal rationalization efforts. It is difficult to forecast these with accuracy, but we would anticipate approximately $100 million to $125 million for 2023. Adjusted non-interest expense increased $68 million or 2% primarily due to the effects of our non-qualified plan. Excluding changes associated with the non-qualified plan, adjusted expense rose 0.6% sequentially, fairly consistent with our outlook from October. Personnel expense increased $84 million, half of which was from changes in the non-qualified plan and half of which was from the recent increase in our minimum wage. These increases were partially offset by a $35 million decrease in marketing expense and a $28 million reduction in other expense. The decline in other expense was driven by lower operational losses, which have decreased for two consecutive quarters, as recent investments in talent, technology, and process have begun to mitigate our fraud-related costs. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, adjusted non-interest expense grew by 8% as a result of the increase in minimum wage, investments in revenue-generating businesses, technology and acquisitions, higher call center staffing to support our clients post merger and a normalizing T&E spend. For the full year, adjusted expenses were $13.1 billion, up modestly from the $12.8 billion baseline in 2019. This performance is strong, reflecting the achievement of the $1.6 billion net cost save target. Overall, we continue to focus on generating expense reductions in certain areas to fund longer-term investments in talent and technology and to generate ongoing operating leverage. Below the line, our fourth quarter results also reflected an effective tax rate of 16.7%, down from 18.2% in the third quarter, primarily due to annual true-ups for state income tax returns. Moving to Slide 16. Asset quality is strong, reflecting our prudent risk culture and diverse loan portfolio. Net charge-offs increased 7 basis points to 34 basis points largely due to seasonality in indirect auto and lower recoveries. The allowance increased $172 million, reflecting strong loan growth and the ALLL ratio was stable at 1.34% as the effects of a moderately slower economic outlook were offset by high quality organic loan growth and the BankDirect acquisition. Excluding the BankDirect portfolio, which has extremely low losses through cycles, the ALLL ratio would have increased approximately 2 basis points. Continuing to Slide 17. Our CET1 ratio decreased from 9.1% to 9.0% as we deployed capital to support strong organic loan growth and close the BankDirect acquisition. We also continue to pay a strong dividend at $0.52 per share. Overall, our capital position remains strong relative to our risk and profitability profile. We expect organic capital generation to improve in 2023 due to the elimination of MOE-related costs and more focused loan growth, all of which will provide additional flexibility and opportunities for Truist. Finally, our liquidity position remains strong with an average LCR of 112% and access to multiple funding sources. Our securities portfolio remains high quality at 97% government guaranteed and continues to produce approximately $3 billion of cash flow per quarter, which has supported our loan growth. Turning to Slide 18 where I\u2019ll provide guidance for the first quarter and full year 2023. Looking into 1Q \u201823, we expect revenues to decline 2% to 3% relative to 4Q 2022, primarily driven by 2 fewer days impacting net interest income in addition to typical seasonal patterns in investment banking, card and payments and service charges, amongst other factors. Adjusted expenses are anticipated to increase 1% to 2% as higher pension expense and FDIC premiums, along with seasonally higher personnel expenses are partially offset by ongoing cost discipline. For the full year 2023, we expect revenues to increase 7% to 9%, driven largely by strong net interest income growth and modestly improving fees. Adjusted expenses are anticipated to increase 5% to 7% as a result of higher pension expense, higher FDIC premiums, the full annual impact of our minimum wage increase and acquisitions that closed throughout 2022. These four factors drive about 4% of our year-over-year increase. Given these factors, we are targeting adjusted operating leverage to be 200 basis points or greater, which would be more than 3x our pace in 2022. We also expect the net charge-off ratio to be between 35 and 50 basis points in 2023, given our expectations for continued normalization across the loan portfolio. Lastly, excluding discrete items, we expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 19%, which translates to approximately 21% if you model it on a taxable equivalent basis. Now I\u2019ll hand it back to Bill for some final remarks. Bill Rogers : Great. Thanks Mike. Continuing on Slide 19, the fourth quarter was a strong finish to a year that was strategic and financial turning point for Truist. The pivot from integrating to operating is real, it\u2019s palpable and it can be evidenced across a number of dimensions. Loan production in the fourth quarter was near the highest it\u2019s been at Truist. This is despite some intentional reductions in certain consumer categories. Commercial Community Bank loan and deposit production in both the fourth quarter and full year was the strongest we\u2019ve had at Truist. Importantly, left lead relationships within CCB were up 36% in 2022, reflecting our increased strategic relevance and advisory capabilities with clients. Branch deposit and checking unit production in the fourth quarter increased 24% and 8%, respectively, compared to the year-ago quarter as teammates became more confident with processes and systems, but also improved solutions and capabilities. Our wealth line of business has had three consecutive quarters of adding net new advisers, and organic asset flows continue to be positive. Integrated relationship management activity across the company gained momentum throughout the year as a result of more focus, increased alignment and improved reporting as we ended the year with a 16% increase in qualified referral activity, excluding mortgage relative to 2021. Average client satisfaction scores for retail and small business banking are ascending and in the fourth quarter reached their highest levels of for the year in key areas that include our branches, call centers, retail digital experiences and small business. Our digital app ratings ended the year as one of the leaders in our peer group after starting near the bottom. The financial benefits of this momentum can be seen with the fourth quarter operating leverage being the strongest of the year and adjusted PPNR building each quarter. So to conclude on Slide 20, our fourth quarter results reaffirm that Truist is on the right path, and I\u2019m highly optimistic about our ability to realize our significant post-integration potential to summarize our investment thesis. Our goal financially has produced strong growth and profitability and to do so with less volatility than our peers. 2023 will be our first full year as Truist with zero integration activity, and our priorities are very clear : Core execution to actualize Truist and our purpose, harvesting IRM opportunities, continuing to digitize and automate our processes and operations and maintaining a strong profitability profile. We will also raise the bar on ourselves, focusing on the KPIs that drive total shareholder return and ensuring executive compensation targets reflects our potential, not just our business mix. While economic uncertainty remains high, Truist is in a position of strength across a broad range of outcomes because of our diverse business mix, conservative credit culture, balanced approach to interest rate risk management, strong profitability profile and our strong risk-adjusted capital position and most notably, our significant performance momentum as we continue to shift from integration to executional excellence and purposeful growth. Ankur, let me turn it back over to you and begin the Q&A. Ankur Vyas : Thanks, Bill. Jess, at this time, if you would explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. Can you hear me? Bill Rogers : Yes, we got you. Mike Mayo : Okay. Great. So it looks like \u2013 I\u2019m going to push the Corvette analogy. It looks like you\u2019re guiding for your Corvette of a franchise to go from first to second gear or maybe second or third, but you\u2019re guiding for twice as much revenue growth. You\u2019re guiding for 3x more operating leverage. But I and others are going to be unsure if you\u2019re going to be able to get that given your headcount\u2019s up 3% quarter-over-quarter in the fourth quarter, you have NII pressures from deposits, and you have capital market headwinds. So I guess the question is, what\u2019s your degree of confidence with this 2023 guidance given some of the pressures and the internal expenses? And along with that, your merger saves, are they all in now? Or do you still get some payout effect that you benefit in the first quarter? I know you disconnected three data centers. Thanks. Bill Rogers : Yes. Yes, Mike, let me start with the last one first. Yes, they are all done. So we\u2019re \u2013 excuse me, entering the year with positive aspect of not sort of having those adjustments every quarter to talk about. And then as it relates to the confidence in our guidance, there is a lot of market uncertainty. So we have to accept that. I mean there is \u2013 things could change the inflation, what are clients going to be doing, but we know a lot of our own internal momentum. We talked about \u2013 I mean, your analogy of first, second or third or fourth. I don\u2019t know how any gears a Corvette has, but we continue to grind through that. So we have our own momentum that we\u2019re creating. And you saw that in some of the production numbers. I think you see that in some of the deposit betas. You see that in terms of our ability to, I think, outperform both in the asset and liability performance of our company as well as in the stability of some of the fee businesses. We\u2019ve got a great insurance business. We\u2019ve got great momentum within our investment banking business. It isn\u2019t just market-driven. I mean these are also relationships that we\u2019re developing with our commercial core businesses. So we\u2019re expanding our capabilities and our prowess. So while there are headwinds and we accept those and understand those, we have enough of our own tailwinds. I sort of call it, the Truist tailwind. That\u2019s just our increased performance, our increased capacity. And when offset those Mike, that\u2019s what gives me the confidence in the guidance is I can feel enough tailwinds to know that we can offset some of the headwinds that we may be facing. Mike Mayo : And then a follow-up, you mentioned good insurance, maybe this is for you, Bill and Mike. You have an insurance operation where publicly comparable peers trade at like 3x the valuation of Truist. So lot of press, no comment from you guys. All you did present involving about this business. How do you think about monetizing some of that unrealized value that tracks value so that shareholders might benefit more? Or is this just part of your firm forever and you would never consider a move like that? Bill Rogers : Yes, Mike, I mean, I think, one, I respect the question, but I think you\u2019ve got to respect that as it relates to specific market rumors or speculation, I just can\u2019t comment on that. But I can comment on the fact that we really like the insurance business. And we\u2019ve been in the insurance business for a long time. Just celebrated its 100th year anniversary. So that was sort of cool. We\u2019ve been supporting the insurance business from acquisitions. So they have been able to grow both, I think, very competitively from organic and inorganic basis, but it\u2019s also a consolidating business. We want to make sure that we\u2019re always providing the right level of support for that insurance business to continue to grow and continue to be really valuable contribution for our shareholders. Mike Mayo : Alright. Thank you. Operator : We will go next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning. Just wondering if you can provide us a little breakdown detail between \u2013 inside your revenue growth guide for the year, just generally speaking, what are you expecting for NII versus fees? And what rate curve are you using in your NII forecast? Mike Maguire : Ken, it\u2019s Mike. I\u2019ll take that one. I guess starting with the last question on the rate curve. Our outlook is that we will see two rate hikes in the first quarter, 25 a piece in February and March and see a policy rate stable until November, where we would expect a cut, which obviously, at the end of the year, probably doesn\u2019t have much of an impact on our NII perspective. Breaking revenue for the year into two components. From an NII perspective, the way I\u2019d think about it is we obviously had really strong growth in 2022. The second half, in particular, also had very nice margin expansion. So we have a really nice exit velocity from an NII perspective. We believe we have a little bit of asset sensitivity left. So we do have the opportunity to realize some of the upside of the hikes in the first quarter and we will have, as Bill mentioned, slowing loan growth. But those two factors combined, we think, give us a stable outlook for Q1 NII. And then for the rest of the year, that we believe we will stay relatively stable, some pressure on the NIMs offset by some modest amount of loan growth. On a year-over-year basis, just given the average loan growth that we would expect that will be, we think, a very nice growth. And frankly, we will drive the majority of the growth potential in the revenue guide. From a fee perspective, I think a couple of puts and a few takes. We expect to continue to have good performance from the insurance business, which is growing nicely on an organic basis as well as realizing the full benefit of the acquisitions that we completed in 2022. Our investment banking business, we believe, has some potential to benefit from improvements in market conditions, probably more likely in the second half than the first half. And then I think we will have a little bit of pressure. We would expect there to be pressure on the on the residential mortgage business as well as the service charges and overdraft fees on deposits. Ken Usdin : Okay. Great. And then a follow-up on deposits, 27% cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta through the fourth quarter. You guys were in the mid-30s last time. I don\u2019t think yet you\u2019ve given us an idea of what you think the cumulative could be this cycle, any views on that at this point in terms of the direction and the endpoint? Thank you. Mike Maguire : Yes, Ken. I\u2019ll take that one again. Look, I\u2019ve been very pleased by how the betas have performed so far. They have outperformed our expectations on a pretty consistent basis. We obviously are seeing some acceleration of rate pursuing behaviors and seeing pressures on balances as well, uncharted territory in many respects. We think we will get through the last cycle, perhaps even high 30s, approaching and even hitting 40% by the time we\u2019re to the last hike. Bill Rogers : And again, it\u2019s Bill. The only thing I\u2019d add is just the strength of our deposit franchise. So you said I asked about our relative deposit beta performance. But we\u2019re really experiencing what we hope we would experience as Truist. We\u2019re sitting in great markets. We\u2019ve got a 21% average share, our competitors\u2019 mainly large banks. We\u2019ve introduced some great new product capability in Truist One. Our branch production\u2019s up. Our teammates are really doing a great job, the ubiquity of presence, the ability to amortize your marketing and be more effective. So our just strength of our overall deposit franchise is starting to manifest itself and show itself of what we thought we could create and create at Truist. Ken Usdin : Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Can you talk about your capital priorities and remind us what your near-term capital targets, please? Bill Rogers : Yes. Matt, our priorities remain the same in terms of the top four priorities. The first is to continue to invest in our business. And we\u2019ve seen a lot of opportunity to do that. I mean you\u2019ve seen the asset growth in our business and RWA growth, and we feel really good about the opportunities to invest in that. The second is to have a secure and growing dividend base. That\u2019s important to our \u2013 both our institutional and our retail shareholders. So that\u2019s a critical. And then the third is M&A opportunities, inorganic opportunities. And you\u2019ve seen we\u2019ve been active. They have been \u2013 some have been smaller by nature, but we\u2019ve seen opportunities to enhance our businesses mostly in the insurance business, but also on the technology side and some capability side and some talent side that we\u2019ve added in those areas. And then the fourth is the \u2013 is share repurchase. And for us, that just hasn\u2019t been as big a priority because we\u2019ve done a lot in the first three of those priorities. And as it relates to target, I mean, we\u2019ve been sort of careful to say we really \u2013 we like where we\u2019re operating right now. So we think we have got the capacity to do the things we need to do. We think given our risk profile, given our stress adjusted risk profile, we think we\u2019re in a really strong position from a capital perspective. But also, as Mike noted in his comments, we accrete. If you think about our earnings profile, but also the fact that our MOE expenses come off, we are sort of in a unique position to accrete capital. So, we will accrete about 25 basis points worth of capital. We have been using some of that for those first two, three priorities that we talked about. So, I think on balance, we will probably see capital increase, but we are comfortable that we have got enough capital to execute our strategies and support our businesses. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then so hypothetically, if you say won the lottery for $5 billion, what would you do with that capital? I don\u2019t think you are going to change the organic growth. The dividend is kind of tapped by regulation, roughly, the last two buckets of M&A and buybacks. And if you walk into that $5 billion, what would you do with it? Bill Rogers : I don\u2019t want to answer a hypothetical lottery question because we are not lottery ticket buyers. That\u2019s not part of our strategy. I think we have got that\u2019s really based on, can we support our businesses long-term. And can we provide the capital they need to grow. And we are going to use all of our strategies and all of our capabilities to ensure that we are supporting businesses and their growth. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Thank you. Bill Rogers : Thanks Matt. Operator : Our next question comes from John McDonald at Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead. John McDonald : Yes. Hi. Good morning. I was wondering if you could give us some color on how you see credit unfolding for Truist this year and what you have baked into the charge-off guidance that you gave for this year? Bill Rogers : Yes. Clarke, will you take that? Clarke Starnes : John, this is Clarke. I will take that one. As you saw, we had 34 basis points in losses in Q4. That reflected primarily seasonality \u2013 normal seasonality in our consumer segments and a little bit of normalization. And as Mike mentioned, we had lower recoveries in our wholesale areas. So, that\u2019s what the delta was from Q3 to Q4. And then what we are seeing is the consumer segments are normalizing. And also just to remind you all that the whole industry has had anemic wholesale and CRE losses over the last couple of years. So, we are pretty similar to that. So therefore, we would expect losses to return towards the lower range of our long-term loss range of 40 basis points to 60 basis points as we go through \u201823, and it just depends upon how the economy performs. And that\u2019s why you see that reflected in our guidance of 35 bps to 50 bps. John McDonald : Okay. Thanks Clarke and then for Mike. Mike, on the expense outlook for adjusted expense growth, mid-single digits, how much of that is kind of pulling through acquisitions you added at the end of last year? And how much of that is kind of core expense growth and investments? Thanks. Mike Maguire : Sure. In \u201823, I believe the annualized M&A impact is $127-or-so million. So, that\u2019s about 1% of that growth. You recall in the guide, we talked about these four components that were \u2013 where we have quite a bit of visibility into and frankly, not much flexibility, and that\u2019s the pension, the M&A impact, the annualized impact of minimum wage and the FDIC expense. And those components in the aggregate are about 4%. Hope that helps. John McDonald : Okay. Got it. Yes. That\u2019s great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala at Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning. Bill Rogers : Good morning. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess just one follow-up, Bill, on the capital allocation question. One, just given \u2013 I mean there is obviously a lot of speculation when you talk to investors around the insurance business. Like if you can talk to, given the multiple difference between insurance companies trading at 20x PE, do you still think it makes sense in terms of deploying capital to do more acquisitions on the insurance front as opposed to buying back stock? And on the other hand, I would love to hear how you would think about maybe moving away from that business, but giving up a very defensible revenue stream? Bill Rogers : Yes. Ebrahim, again, I am not going to comment on sort of where we are from a speculative standpoint, other than to say, we love the insurance business. We want the insurance business to grow. We have done, I am staring at John, probably 100 acquisitions over time. So, we have got a really good framework in assisting that business to grow. But as I mentioned in my earlier comments, it is a consolidated business. So, we want to make sure that we have got all the flexibility and capability to create capital and support all of our businesses and their growth. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And I guess just taking a step back with the merger integration done, the cost behind you. Remind us in terms of like what we have not heard so far on the call is the scale benefits as we think about go forward in terms of picking up bigger deals on the lending side, on the fee revenue side? Just remind us some of the revenue synergies we should expect from the Truist franchise on a go-forward basis and why you can outperform just the peers within the market or within your asset size set? Bill Rogers : Yes. Great question. And one of them I talked about just a minute ago was the deposit franchise. So, the scale, and the ubiquity, and the size, and the prowess that we have in our markets, I think is a distinct advantage and you see that. The other component of that is the markets that we are in. So, not only is it scale, but at scale in the right places. So, we have markets that I think will sustain sort of any economic environment with higher beta to the upside and a lower beta to the downside, so, in markets where we have a lot of in-migration versus out-migration and business development and growth. So, that\u2019s one component. You mentioned the capital markets side, and I have talked about the community bank, the prowess that we have seen there, 36% increase in left leads and those type things. That comes from scale. That comes from an ability to be more relevant to our clients, to have discussions with them that we weren\u2019t having before, to be more strategic and to be in that left lead spot versus that right lead spot. And we all know the economics of that. I mean the economics are multiples of where you are in the spectrum. So, our relevance is not only related to our scale, but also related to our product and capabilities. We have tried to sort of put a number on that. And I would say sort of back-of-the-envelope kind of math, I mean it\u2019s at least 10% of some of the growth that we have seen in our investment banking business, we could attribute to being more scale-oriented, again, not taking outsized positions, but taking positions that are on the left versus the right and the economics that come along with that. And then everything to do with all the operations and efficiency, so, everything to do with the base that we operate from. We just had more opportunity to create more efficiency. So, when we do something that has previously had tens of millions of dollars of impact. Today, it can have $50 million and $60 million of impact because you are doing it across a bigger base and a bigger capability. The ability to negotiate better contracts with our providers and our partners and we saw a lot of that in the merger. Our ability to go in and be more relevant and more important to them, get terms that we think better reflect that. Mike, what else am I forgetting in that list because it\u2019s a long list, I mean it\u2019s a great question and one we probably ought to talk more about. Mike Maguire : Yes. I think it\u2019s been moving more relevant on capabilities, more relevant on size. You are seeing it in the results, whether it would be the ability to manage expenses. Bill Rogers : The financial markets, our pricing on debt deals. Mike Maguire : Yes, exactly right. Bill Rogers : So, the list is pretty long. Ebrahim Poonawala : Alright. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Scouten at Piper Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Ankur Vyas : Stephen, are you there. Maybe, Jess, we go to the next person. See if Stephen can get back in after. Operator : Absolutely. We will do that. We will go back to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning Bill and good morning Mike. Can you guys share with us, you have got some good guidance on the operating leverage for 2023 being, I think Mike, you said about 3x the level of what you achieved in 2022. But I noticed that in the third quarter and fourth quarters, the operating leverage was higher than what you are hoping to achieve in \u201823. Can you share with us why there seems to be some slowdown in that operating leverage relative to the fourth quarter or third quarters of 2022? Mike Maguire : Yes. Sure, Gerard. As we look into \u201823, I think a couple of factors. One, we \u2013 obviously, 2022 was a year where we had outsized, particularly in the second half, loan growth and net interest margin expansion, which obviously was a great tailwind on the revenue side. As we look into \u201823, we expect to continue to have nice growth from a year-over-year perspective, but we are expecting that NII trend to really stabilize. And frankly, we are going to begin to experience some pressure on the NIM side probably in the second quarter. From an expense perspective, we also mentioned, there are a few just structural expenses that are in the plan for \u201823 that when combined, add up to about 4% year-over-year change. We obviously intend to make investments beyond those four categories in our clients and our teammates and in other strategic investment priorities. But that structural expense growth is there. So, again, we feel good about that sort of 2% with upside operating leverage guide and feel good about our \u2013 frankly, our revenue guide as well. So, hopefully, that\u2019s helpful to you. Gerard Cassidy : Good. No, I appreciate that. And then as a follow-up, many of you \u2013 or many of your peers and yourselves are obviously building up loan loss reserves. The outlooks that people are using, are calling for a weaker economy, but we don\u2019t seem to be seeing that yet in any of the numbers. And if you look at the spreads in the high-yield market, they haven\u2019t blown out. One of your competitors or peers, as they pointed out that the spreads in commercial loans still are pretty tight. So, I don\u2019t know, Bill, when you talk to your customers, what are they seeing that maybe we might not see as much of a downturn as everybody is kind of forecasting right now later this year? Bill Rogers : Yes. I mean I think you pointed out, I mean the data are confusing. There is just no doubt about that. I mean you see some positives and you see some negatives. If you look at \u2013 just think about the last few days, retail sales were not really very strong, sort of a poor Christmas selling season. You have seen inflation being a bigger part of what people do, and supply chain seems to sort of be reconciling itself. So, I think it\u2019s more of a perspective, just \u2013 there has to be a higher impact from higher inflation. And whether that\u2019s reduced hiring from our clients, whether that\u2019s reduced capital investment, and all those type things. And in fairness, it\u2019s a little more prospective. So, when we talk to our clients and we look at our portfolios today, things are great. I mean as Clarke mentioned, our commercial portfolio looks fantastic. Our clients are in really good shape. But rents will come due, things will \u2013 payments will come due, things will change over time. So, I think it\u2019s just a little more of trying to understand where the economy is puck\u2019s going versus where it is today, because I think today, it actually looks pretty strong. Clarke, what would you add to that? Clarke Starnes : Well, I would just say, to your point, Bill, clients\u2019 balance sheets, their liquidity, their financial positions are very good going into this. Obviously, depending on what happens in the economy, the impact of the higher rates, input costs, all of these things, we are monitoring very closely with our clients. Gerard, we are looking at things like CRE and the term risk and things like office. So, I think we are just looking out what could be some of those impacts from the \u2013 if the economy does slow and obviously, that\u2019s reflected in everyone\u2019s provisioning models. But to your point, the actual performance to-date and the near-term outlook is still strong. Bill Rogers : Consumer side, I mean on the consumer side, it is normalizing and in some cases, normalized to where we are right now. So, you do start to see some of that. We have done a lot of work looking at sort of our lower-income borrowers and some of the challenges that they may be facing from inflation. Maybe they are not facing it today, but that\u2019s starting to build as they start to withdraw a little more deposits. So, it is more of a prospective thing than a current thing and we are all trying to find the right calibration of where things might land. And we don\u2019t want to undershoot that runway. I mean we want to be conservative. We want to be appropriate and think through all the risk that could exist in the portfolio. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Appreciate the color. Bill Rogers : Great. Operator : Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Bill Rogers : Hi Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi. I just want to understand a little bit more. I know we touched in a couple of different ways, but you have got the revenue outlook for 2023, up 7% to 9%. And what I am hearing is loan growth slowing slightly from the 11% level you have now, but really not that much and that the fees \u2013 fee growth will be lower due to some of the things you have mentioned around mortgage. But that loan growth is likely to be a little bit above that adjusted revenue number with the pressure coming a little bit in fees and then also NIM pulling back in the back half of the year. Is that a fair summary? Bill Rogers : Yes. Betsy, I think I would say it maybe a little bit differently. And I think Mike was trying to make this point. I mean we are sort of \u2013 if you look at sort of NII for the fourth quarter, and we are assuming that sort of stable through the year. So, that\u2019s the big driver. I mean if you think about what\u2019s the big bus and the revenue guidance, it\u2019s NII being stable. And that\u2019s not loan growth at the kind of revenue numbers. I mean the loan growth is going to pull back a little bit. Some of that\u2019s going to be intentional on our part. A lot of it\u2019s going to be return-oriented, just making sure that we have got really, really great relevance with our clients. And in some cases, the fee business is we expect to be up. We expect insurance to be up. We expect it to continue in its sort of high-single digit organic growth. We still have some inorganic momentum from some of the acquisitions we have gotten. We expect investment banking to actually return and increase its revenue growth. That will probably be a little more back-end weighted in fairness, but as we see where markets come out. But the big driver is sort of the NII fourth quarter where we are and that moving forward on a stabilized basis. That\u2019s the biggest driver. Betsy Graseck : And I know in the press release, you talked a bit about having \u2013 managing your deposit costs well and tightly, etcetera. Can you give us a sense as to how you think about the trajectory of that line item as we go through \u201823? Bill Rogers : Yes. I will do it at a high level. I mean it will be \u2013 continue to be slightly down. So, I mean I think that\u2019s \u2013 that trend will continue. I think on a relative basis, we are showing deposit betas that are more reflective of our opportunity. And as the costs continue to grow, I mean deposit betas will increase. Mike, I don\u2019t know if you want to comment sort of specifically how we are thinking about that. Mike Maguire : Yes. We mentioned in an earlier question that we see betas increasing. Whether they reach the 40% level or not, we will see. I would say the other trend, Betsy, which is consistent with what others are expecting and what\u2019s consistent with our expectation is we are still seeing a remixing from DDA and interest-bearing so that makes sense. And we are still well above where we were sort of pre-stimulus. We were in the high-20s, 28%, 29%. We peaked during the sort of height of stimulus in the 35.5%, 36%. We are back at like 34% right now and going to 33% and probably approaching 30% over time. And I think, Bill, you hit it right. I mean I think we are seeing some deposit balance pressure in the aggregate and we would expect that to continue in 2023, perhaps moderate a bit. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Got it. Mike Maguire : That\u2019s great. Ankur Vyas : Alright. Thanks Betsy. Jess, it looks like there is not anyone left in the queue, so that completes our earnings call. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team. Thank you all for your interest in Truist. We hope you have a great day. Jess, you can now disconnect the call. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that will conclude today\u2019s call. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your line at this time.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Ankur Vyas, Head of Investor Relations, Truist Financial Corporation. Ankur Vyas : Thank you, Allay, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist's first quarter 2023 earnings call. With us today are our Chairman and CEO, Bill Rogers; and our CFO, Mike Maguire. During this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's first quarter results, share their perspectives on current business conditions and recent events, and provide an outlook -- updated outlook for 2023. Clarke Starnes, our Vice Chair and Chief Risk Officer; Beau Cummins, our Vice Chair; John Howard, Truist Insurance Holdings' Chairman and CEO are also in attendance and are available to participate in the Q&A portion of our call. The accompanying presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the Truist Investor Relations website, ir.truist.com. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slides 2 and 3 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix for appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill. Bill Rogers : Thanks, Ankur, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call. I know you have a busy day ahead of you. The first quarter of 2023 was certainly an unusual and maybe even possibly an historic one for our banking industry. I am really extremely proud of our more than 50,000 teammates who leaned into our purpose and continue to care for our clients and stakeholders, reassuring them of Truist's position of strength and commitment to serve them. Throughout the quarter, we continue to experience the benefits of our shift from integrating to operating as evidenced by improved organic production and increasing client satisfaction scores which in our branches has send it to new highs from the weeks after March 9. Based on a volatile and uncertain environment, we successfully demonstrated the strength and resiliency of Truist's diverse business mix, scale and market share, granular and relationship-oriented deposit base and strong capital and liquidity. But as we will also discuss, some of that positive momentum was offset by some higher funding costs and somewhat elevated expenses. Strategically, we continue to take actions to optimize our franchise and focus our resources on areas where we have an advantage in the marketplace and at the same time, simplify, consolidate or exit certain activities to improve profitable growth. Mike will share some of those details later in the call. We'll provide more details on the quarter's results and other topical items throughout the presentation. But first, let's begin with our purpose on Slides 4 and 5. And in certain times, it can be easy to focus on the short-term at the expense of the long-term, which is why it's important that we always lead with purpose at Truist. These slides are a powerful reminder that the most effective way to grow over the long-term is to deliver on our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities. But today, my comments will be on this topic a little briefer to gauge investor interest and other topics. Our purpose statement intentionally begins with the words Inspire. And that's exactly what I witnessed while working closely with our teammates in March. As I mentioned, I was inspired by how our teammates leaned into purpose and care as they held numerous discussions with clients and stakeholders to answer their questions about the banking system to emphasize Truist's financial position and strength and help them move forward with their financial needs. In addition to client care we provided last month, there were many other ways we actualized our purpose throughout the quarter, which we highlight on Slide 5. You can read more about these items and many of our other efforts to build better lives and communities in our 2022 Corporate Responsibility Report, which we published last week. Now I'll walk through our first quarter performance highlights on Slide 7. Quarter performance slide focused mostly on GAAP or unadjusted results given that MOE-related spend (ph) exited our run rate last year. Going forward, we intend to focus primarily on GAAP results with the exceptions of adjusted tangible efficiency and adjusted PPNR since intangible amortization expense remained significant due to the scale of the MOE and has no impact on capital generation. Truist reported first quarter net income of $1.4 billion or $1.05 a share, up 6% like quarter due to strong growth in adjusted PPNR, lower merger cost, partially offset by a more normal provision level compared to a year ago. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2022, EPS decreased 13%, primarily due to lower net interest income and seasonality. Adjusted PPNR decreased 7% sequentially, consistent with our prior guidance as better than expected fee income due to higher capital markets activity was more than offset by lower net interest income and somewhat higher than expected expenses. Relative to the first quarter of 2022, adjusted PPNR grew 19%, and we delivered 310 basis points of positive adjusted operating leverage, reflecting a good start to the year. Asset quality remains strong and net charge-offs continue to normalize consistent with our expectations. We prudently built our ALLL ratio 3 basis points to reflect a more uncertain economic environment. Balance sheet trends despite all the noise in mid-March were fairly expected and more business as usual, and we'll cover more about loans, deposits, capital and liquidity later in the presentation. So moving to our digital and technology update on Slide 8. Continued investments in progress in digital will be even more critical due to the close relationship between digital engagement, primacy of relationships and deposits. The good news is Truist prioritized digital early in the merger, building the Truist digital experience organically and in the cloud, which allows us to fully-own the digital experience for our clients end-to-end. Our first quarter results reflect our continued investments agility and momentum. In the first quarter, we opened 146,000 deposit accounts digitally, exceeding our internal expectations. We saw a strong growth in digital transactions and Zelle, in particular, underscoring the importance of payments and money movement capabilities to our clients. More broadly, we had an incredibly productive technology quarter as we advance our strategy to reimagine our capability set. In the deposit space, we launched a new data driven deposit pricing engine, which provides personalized relationship based rates for clients during account opening and will allow us to be even more targeted with respect to rate paid. We also enhanced our digital lending capabilities with the launch of our commercial loan dashboard, an industry-leading solution that allows wholesale lending clients to track the status of their loans, upload documents and eventually electronically signed documents. Our goal is to eventually incorporate this dashboard into one view, our desired end-state integrated digital experience across payments, lending and capital markets creating a seamless experience for commercial and corporate clients and to our relationship with Truist. So turning to loans and leases on Slide 9. Loan growth was solid in portfolios targeted for growth and lower portfolios where we've intentionally pulled back. Average loan balances grew 1.7% sequentially while end-of-period balances increased a more modest 50 basis points. The slower growth on an end-of-period basis was intentional and expected and reflects our strategic decision in the second half of last year to reduce production in certain lower return portfolios, including indirect auto and correspondent mortgage while also increasing rates and spreads from ongoing production. C&I balances increased 3.6% on an average basis and 1.8% on an end-of-period basis due to continued growth across CIB and CCB, reflecting the benefits of our capabilities and our markets. Consumer loan balances decreased 60 basis points on average and were down 1% from December 31, reflecting ongoing runoff in student and partnership lending as well as lower indirect auto production. Strategically, we're focusing our balance sheet on Truist clients who have broader relationships while limiting our balance sheet usage with more single product and indirect clients. We're also evaluating ways to increase the velocity of our balance sheet, increasing greater utilization of loan sales and securitization. This allows us to be more impactful and increase returns in businesses such as service finance. Next, I'll provide some perspective on overall deposit trends starting on Slide 10. Despite the unique events of mid-March, average deposit trends during the first quarter were generally consistent with our expectations. Average deposit balance decreased 1.2%, driven by quantitative tightening, inflation and movements to higher rate alternatives. Within the month of March, more deposit flows were concentrated in the period from March 11 to March 18 and have largely been business as usual since including through yesterday. Positive outflows during mid-March were primarily related to CIG and CCB clients. We chose to diversify in the money market mutual funds and in some cases, across multiple bags. These outflows tended to be a higher cost of non-operational deposits. We also experienced deposit inflows as we're both attracting new clients and expanding our relationships with existing clients. Retail production continues to improve due to our shift from integrating to operating and leading with the value proposition of Truist One. In the first quarter, Truist saw record new deposit production, including 18% year-over-year uplift in branch account openings with improved client retention driving strong net new account performance. Commercial Community Banking had record new account growth in March, and we've seen good momentum in the first couple of weeks of April as clients are beginning to move money to fund those accounts. More noteworthy than overall deposit flows was the pace of the mix shift from DDA as non-interest-bearing deposits decreased to 32% of deposits from 34% previously. This happened a little sooner than we previously anticipated. Interest-bearing deposit costs increased 64 basis points sequentially, contributing to a cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta of 36% so far in the cycle. Deposit betas accelerated relative to the fourth quarter due to the presence of high rate alternatives and the previously mentioned shift from non-interest-bearing DDA into interest-bearing products. We'll continue to be attentive to client needs and relationships while maximizing the value outside of rate paid. Given higher investor interest and additional deposit details, we provided a closer look at our deposit base on Slide 11. Truist has one of the most robust deposit franchises in the banking industry, thanks to three key factors. First, Truist has strong market shares in many of the fastest-growing markets in the U.S. Truist currently ranks first, second or third in deposit share in 17 of the Top 20 markets. Those include cities like Atlanta, Charlotte, D.C., Miami, Tampa, Raleigh-Durham, among others, making us the dominant player in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic. Second, Truist has a granular retail leading deposit base that is 63% insured and/or collateralized, which is the second highest in our peer group and an important source of stability. In addition, our commercial deposits are diversified across 21 industry groups with no one sector representing more than 10% of corporate and commercial banking deposits. Third, we're highly relationship oriented, as you can see from the table at the bottom of the slide. The average deposit account at Truist has been open for 17 years during which time these relationships have broadened to include multiple products and services. In retail and small business banking, we have over 12 million deposit accounts with an average account balance of 17,000. RSBB deposits are highly granular and 86% of balances are insured. In addition, Truist is the primary bank for the preponderance of those clients. In our Wealth business, 90% of the depositors have investments with Truist Wealth and our Commercial Community Bank 81% depositors have a payments lending or advisory relationship with Truist, with the majority of that related to operating treasury management products. Together, these factors are a source of strength for Truist and for our clients. So now let me turn it over to Mike to discuss our financial results in more detail. Mike Maguire : Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with net interest income on Slide 12. For the quarter, taxable equivalent net interest income decreased 2.8% sequentially as higher funding costs and two fewer days in the quarter more than offset the effects of solid loan growth. Reported net interest margin decreased 8 basis points, while core net interest margin decreased 7 basis points. When you break down the decrease in the core net interest margin, approximately 5 basis points was driven by a shift in the funding mix from DDA and other low cost deposit products into interest-bearing deposits and about 2 basis points was due to our decision to conservatively carry more liquidity during the last few weeks of March. Moving to fee income on Slide 13. Fee income was relatively stable compared to the fourth quarter and modestly exceeded our expectations in light of typical seasonal headwinds. Insurance income increased $47 million, largely due to seasonality. Year-over-year organic revenue growth was 4.7%. Mortgage banking income rose $25 million, primarily due to a gain on sale of a servicing portfolio, which was partially offset by MSR valuation adjustments. Income from core mortgage activity was relatively stable compared to the prior quarter. Wealth management income improved $15 million, benefiting from an increase in brokerage commissions, asset flows and higher fees due to rising asset prices during the quarter. Wealth continues to build momentum as net organic asset flows, which exclude the impact of market value changes, were approximately $1 billion for the quarter and have been positive for seven of the last eight quarters. In addition, we were pleased by the modest increase in investment banking and trading income, led by strength in investment grade and high yield bond originations, fixed income derivatives and loan syndications. CIB's performance continues to be aided by two idiosyncratic factors, strategic hiring over the past two years as well as increased integrated relationship management activity. With respect to IRM, capital markets fees from non-CIB clients increased 12% sequentially and were 20% up from first quarter 2022. Other income decreased $56 million, primarily due to lower income from our non-qualified plan. While fee income remains below its potential, our investments in key areas such as insurance, investment banking and wealth will continue to be a source of momentum as markets normalize and as our IRM execution continues to mature. Turning now to Slide 14. Reported non-interest expense declined $31 million driven by a $107 million reduction in merger costs due to the completion of integration activities and a $27 million decrease in amortization expense. The expense reductions I just described were largely offset by $103 million or a 3% increase in adjusted non-interest expense. Expense drivers included a $39 million increase in pension expense and a $23 million increase in regulatory charges due to higher FDIC premiums. We also experienced a $33 million increase in operating losses, which are reflected in other expense due to industry check fraud issues and then operating loss within Truist Insurance recognized prior to completing our transaction with Stone Point. As a company, we are committed to generating expense reductions and have undertaken a number of actions that help bend the expense arc at Truist. Last week, we announced a strategic realignment within our fixed income sales and trading business in which we discontinued certain market-making activities and services provided by our middle markets fixed income platform. This platform was largely focused on MBS-related sales and trading for depositories and had produced an unattractive ROE. This realignment will result in an approximate $50 million run rate expense save with little PPNR impact and enable us to focus more on our core strategy of being a fulsome and premier investment bank for corporates, sponsors and municipal issuers. We're also in the process of realigning our LightStream platforms with our broader consumer business with the goal of bringing the innovation, digital capabilities, efficiencies and cloud-based infrastructure of LightStream to Truist's broader client base. This will reduce the cost of supporting a separate brand and strategy and enhance the experience and primacy with our existing and prospective clients. In addition, we continue to adjust our capacity and focus in mortgage to reflect current challenging market conditions and our own strategic focus on client primacy. These actions, among others, are what drove the $63 million of restructuring charges during the quarter. Furthermore, we've also aligned executive compensation to Truist to shareholder expectations, which I shared with many of you about a month ago. Taken together, we believe these as well as other actions we're taking will increase our focus, bend our expense curve and improve returns for Truist. Moving to Slide 15. Asset quality remained strong in the first quarter, reflecting our prudent risk culture and diverse loan portfolio. Leading indicators remain favorable. Loans 30 to 89 days past due decreased 15 basis points sequentially and were down 17 basis points versus the first quarter of 2022. Our NPL ratio was steady at a relatively benign 36 basis points. Net charge-offs increased 3 basis points to 37 basis points, primarily due to C&I and continued normalization in the consumer and are consistent with pre-pandemic levels. We became even more cautious in our outlook regarding CRE fundamentals. And in light of increased economic uncertainty, we prudently increased our allowance by $102 million and increased our ALLL ratio by 3 basis points to 1.37%. In anticipation of an increasing risk environment, we are also tightening credit and reducing our risk appetite in selected areas while maintaining our through-the-cycle approach for high-quality, long-term clients. Next, given high investor interest, I will dive deeper into CRE on Slide 16. As we began the integration process to become Truist, we were very intentional about retaining the diversification benefits of the merger. To achieve this outcome, we carefully evaluated our various portfolios, including CRE to ensure we fully understood their combined risk profile and to establish how we would manage them going forward. While we did not wholly pause CRE production during this process, we did deemphasize it until we aligned on a single go-to-market strategy. As a result of this decision, Truist CRE portfolio actually decreased by 2.2% from the end of 2019 to the end of 2022, whereas our median peer grew CRE 21%. Our disciplined focus on diversification has also resulted in less CRE concentration and risk relative to our peer group. At year-end, CRE represented 11% of our loan mix compared to 12% at our median peer and the office segment comprised 1.6% of our loan book versus 1.9% at our median peer. We maintain a high-quality CRE portfolio through disciplined risk management and prudent client selection. We typically work with developers and sponsors we know well and have observed their performance through the cycle. Our exposure tends to be large CRE with strong institutional sponsorship, and we have reduced our exposure to smaller CRE. The quality of our CRE portfolio is also reflected in the Federal Reserve's annual stress test results. Our disciplined approach to CRE is reflected in our asset quality metrics, which remain solid. In the lower right, you can see a snapshot of our office portfolio, which had approximately $5 billion in outstanding balances as of March 31 and another area where Truist has been risk averse and highly selective over the past two years. Our office portfolio tends to be weighted towards Class A properties within our footprint, which we believe will perform better than large urban markets. We have a great CRE team that is very proactive in working with clients to get ahead of any problems. Criticized trends have increased over the past few months, but we believe overall problems will be manageable given our conservative LTVs, our reserves and the laddered maturity profile of the portfolio. Turning to capital and liquidity on Slide 17. Our CET1 ratio increased from 9% to 9.1% as approximately 20 basis points of organic capital generation was partially offset by 12 basis points of CECL phase-in. While not included in our CET1 ratio, AOCI improved by $1 billion from December 31 to March 31. Of our $12.6 billion of after-tax OCI, as of March 31, $8.5 billion is related to our AFS portfolio, $2.5 billion is related to the frozen portion of the HTM portfolio, and $1.5 billion is related to our pension plan. We would expect the securities portfolio related OCI to decrease by $2 billion to $2.5 billion by the end of 2024 or by approximately 20%, and that's in a static rate environment. In addition, this accretion will be a powerful driver of higher tangible book value per share over time, a small glimpse of which we saw this past quarter with tangible book value increasing 8%. On April 3, we also closed on the sale of a 20% minority stake in Truist Insurance Holdings, which added approximately 30 basis points to our capital ratios and provides flexibility in the future. Additionally, we declared a strong common dividend of $0.52 per share, which was paid on March 1. Finally, Truist continues to have significant access to liquidity and a very robust liquidity managed process that includes internal and external stress testing as well as real-time monitoring of our liquidity position. Our average consolidated LCR improved to 113% during the first quarter and remains well above the regulatory minimum of 100%. We have access to approximately $166 billion of liquidity, including cash, FHLB borrowing capacity, unpledged securities and discount window capacity. As a reminder, government and agency obligations represent 97% of our securities portfolio, which produces about $2.5 billion to $3 billion of cash flow per quarter. During the quarter, we conservatively increased our cash position from $16 billion as of December 31 to $33 billion at the end of March, funded largely by callable FHLB advances and would expect that to somewhat normalize going forward given that activity has stabilized. More broadly, we do expect regulatory requirements around capital and liquidity to heighten, but believe we're in a strong position to respond given the already high expectations for an institution of our size, the strategic and financial flexibility we have as a company in the orderly phase-in period that would likely accompany potential changes. Now I will review our updated guidance on Slide 18. Looking into the second quarter of 2023, we expect revenues to be relatively stable compared to the first quarter as a modest decline in NII is offset by seasonally stronger insurance revenue. Adjusted expenses are anticipated to increase 1% to 2% linked quarter primarily as a result of higher incentive-based compensation from insurance revenue growth. For the full year 2023, we now expect revenues to increase 5% to 7% compared to 2022. The decline from our previous outlook is driven almost entirely by a lower net interest income outlook given higher deposit and funding costs. Adjusted expenses are still expected to increase between 5% and 7%. As I indicated earlier, we remain focused on taking actions throughout the year to reduce costs. Excluded from our adjusted expense outlook are two items. First, we are not including the impact of any potential incremental FDIC surcharge or assessment. After we receive clarity, we'll provide an update on estimated impact. Secondly, there will be some one-time costs occurring in 2023 and 2024 tied to preparing Truist Insurance Holdings to transition its operating model to be more independent, which is consistent with its new capital structure. These expenses directly correlate to realizing significant value in the business over time. We will not adjust for these expenses in our results, but we will provide transparency. Our goal is still to produce positive operating leverage and positive adjusted PPNR growth for the full year, excluding these two items. The degree of difficulty has increased relative to January given higher funding costs. Our expectations for the net charge-off ratio to be between 35 basis points for the full year is unchanged. Lastly, excluding discrete items, we now expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 20%, which translates to approximately 22% on a taxable equivalent basis due to our adoption of recent accounting guidance regarding the amortization of new market tax credits. This change simply shifts contra revenue and other income to the tax expense line and has no impact on the bottom line. Now I'll hand it back to Bill for some final remarks. Bill Rogers : Great. Thanks, Mike. So to conclude on Slide 19, Truist is on the right path. And I'm highly optimistic about our ability to realize our significant post-integration potential as summarized in our investment thesis. Our goal financially is to produce strong growth and profitability and to do so with less volatility than our peers. As we began to shift from integrating to operating several quarters ago, we also made a strategic decision to focus our resources on areas where we have an advantage in the marketplace and are most synergistic with our core strengths. Since that time, we focus on product solutions and distinctive experiences that are most relevant to our primary consumer and deposit households into our commercial, corporate and high net worth clients while reducing our investment in businesses and clients that are less strategically relevant with respect to returns and relationship opportunities. We believe these changes are consistent with where the banking industry is likely to go from here. We're already realizing the early benefits of this shift. For instance, first quarter net new consumer checking account production was among the best we've seen since becoming Truist, driven by our continued focus on core deposit clients, the attractiveness of new products, including Truist One and improve retention as well as flight to quality. Branch checking account production has increased 13% since the launch of Trust One, and as I said earlier, has accelerated up to 18% compared to a year ago in the first quarter. The steady improvement we've seen in client satisfaction has been driven by the distinct service our branch and care agents provide as well as improvements in our digital processes and procedures that originated in our client journey rooms. As I indicated earlier, I'm really proud to care of our teammates -- care our teammates provided to our clients in March, and this is reflected in higher voice of client scores during the last few weeks of the quarter. Lastly, we continue to advance our integrated relationship management program by establishing long-term growth targets for our most strategic IRM partnerships, details of which I shared in December. Relative to the first quarter of last year, these strategic partnerships have grown revenues by 35%. At the same time, we acknowledge that the environment is tougher and strong balance sheet and expense management will remain critical for our stakeholders. In closing, while uncertainty has increased, Truist is in a position of strength across a broad range of outcomes because of our diverse business mix, dynamic markets, conservative credit (ph) culture, balanced approach to interest rate risk management, strong profitability profile and our strong risk-adjusted capital position. I am truly optimistic about the future of Truist as our more than 50,000 talented teammates build on our momentum to create distinctive client experiences and deliver on our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities. So with that, Ankur, let me turn it back over to you for Q&A. Ankur Vyas : Great. Thank you, Bill. Allay, at this time, will you explain to our listeners how they can participate in the Q&A session? As you do that, I'd like to ask the participants to limit yourselves to one primary question and one follow-up so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today. Operator : Of course, thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go ahead and take our first question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to start just on the deposit front, good color you gave in terms of the relationships. You mentioned in the deck that end-of-period was down 2%, and some of that was seasonal. So just wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on just how you saw deposits end the quarter and if you've seen stabilization and what kind of outlook you just see for the flow and mix of deposits from here? Thanks. Mike Maguire : Hey. Good morning, Ken. It's Mike. That's right. We saw really throughout the course of the quarter, relatively stable flows. Actually, if you think about sort of where we saw our balances evolve throughout the first-two months of the quarter, very typical. We saw some seasonal outflows related to public funds. We saw the expected impact of qualitative tightening, which we've seen throughout the previous couple of quarters. And so we're probably down about 1% or so. And then in the last month of the quarter, we really saw continued public fund outflows. We saw a little bit of higher rate pursuant behavior. We saw people cycling into money market accounts to a higher extent. We saw some of our wealth clients cycle into investment accounts and ended down about 2% for the quarter. I'd say the bulk of the money [indiscernible] happened during that week that Bill mentioned in our opening remarks. As far as outlook is concerned, it's been business as usual and steady since really that first week in March. And our expectation, frankly, is that the impacts that were driving some pressure in the fourth quarter and the first two-thirds of the first quarter will continue to put pressure on deposits, probably to the tune of 1% to 2%. Ken Usdin : Okay. And just my follow-up is just then what about that mix? And what -- how do you expect that mix of DDAs to total as there's more cycling of that? I think you're down to about 32% in the first quarter. What do you think -- you had previously said you thought you could approach that 30% over time. Has that view changed at all given what's happened? Bill Rogers : Yeah. Ken, it's Bill. We're -- pre-COVID, we were sort of at 29%. As you mentioned, we're right 32% now. We're going to clearly migrate down to that high-20s. And sort of depending upon where rates are, I think that sort of is the stabilization level as based upon what we know right now. And just to add to what Mike said as well and continue to just focus on the positive side of the retail deposit production, I just expect that engine to continue. So while sort of on balance, we might be down flattish to down 1 or so percent, that includes a really good positive production momentum we have in our core franchise. Ken Usdin : Understood. Thank you. Bill Rogers : Yeah. Operator : We'll move on to our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Blake Netter : Hi. This is Blake Netter on the line for Betsy. Good morning. Bill Rogers : Good morning. Blake Netter : I'm wondering, if you could \u2013 could talk about how you're thinking about the potential impact of tougher LCR requirements and TLAC (ph) [indiscernible] expected to be announced in the near future. How -- and how should we think about your debt issuance plans and other potential impact? Mike Maguire : Sure. I'd say from a TLAC perspective, this is something that we've had our eyes on for a number of quarters that the entire industry has, certainly, companies our size. We've studied the framework. We've previously probably were considering tailored versions of TLAC, perhaps that will ultimately be the case. But in the abundance of caution, the framework that we've assessed is sort of a traditionally applied framework, the same that the largest banks in the country have applied. And from our perspective, our regular way issuance, certainly given some reasonable phase-in period will allow Truist to comply really without much effort. And so to your question around debt issuance, we -- you saw we raised $3 billion in January. Our expectation given Truist scale and funding needs and perspective is that we'll be a relatively regular issuer. And to the extent that we get a better sense for what's eligible and not eligible from a TLAC perspective, that may influence how we issue whether it's at the holding company or the opco. But I think the net of it is that we feel really well prepared and positioned to comply with TLAC to the extent that that's applied to Truist. Blake Netter : Got it. And separately, just one more question for me. Service charges on deposits came down a bit sequentially this quarter. Can you talk about the potential for overdrafts you used to get even [indiscernible] from here? Bill Rogers : Yeah. They're going to continue to get lower like, we instituted our Truist One, which is sort of a big part of the deposit generation and new client acquisition, but it's also our no overdraft fee accounts. So those will continue to draft lower. And those are in all of our guidance and everything that we talked about. And they\u2019re basically right on path to where we thought they\u2019d be. Blake Netter : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. John Pancari : Good morning. Bill Rogers : Hi. Good morning. John Pancari : On the -- back to the deposit growth expectation, I just want to confirm that on 1% to 2%. Is that on end-of-period balances and debt for the full year, your expectation? Thanks. Mike Maguire : Yeah. That's a quarterly view. And I'm not sure that's going to sort of be linear in its progression. If we think about just the impact of qualitative tightening and some of the work that we've done and certainly prior to this first quarter was just getting a sense for our share of the easing and how that may impact our share of the tightening. And so that 1% to 2% is reflective of QT continuing on a quarterly basis, and it's also reflective of, frankly, is the rate environment that we're in as people continue to assess bank alternative products where perhaps higher rates or investment products are or an alternative, but that's a quarterly view. John Pancari : Okay. Got it, Mike. Thank you. And then separately, also on the margin and deposit dynamics. Can you maybe talk to us about how you can see this playing out in terms of the net interest margin project progression from here? And then also, what do you expect is a fair through cycle deposit beta. I know you're currently at 36%. And I want to get your thoughts there. Thanks. Mike Maguire : Sure. Maybe just -- and we mentioned in our prepared remarks, our net interest margin in the first quarter, we were down on a reported basis, about 8 basis points, and that really had two primary drivers. The first was, we also mentioned that we have a little bit more liquidity on the balance sheet. That was something that we made the decision to do sort of in the abundance of caution. And so while that doesn't really have an impact on NII because there's very sort of de minimis negative carry relative to the funding cost there, it did swell the size of the balance sheet a bit. So the denominator impact drove about 2 basis points of net interest margin decline. And then we also had just the overall funding mix shift, which probably drove the bulk of the rest. There's also 1 basis point in there for PAA. Those same factors that drove our NIM down 8 basis points in the first quarter exist in the second quarter as well. Perhaps to -- and to some extent, in terms of the behaviors, maybe it will be a little bit more modest, but you also have to quarterize some of those impacts. And so our expectation is that NIM probably has downside of another, call it, dozen basis points in the second quarter. As far as the second half, probably have a more stable outlook for the NIM. There's -- we've mentioned before that we've sort of intentionally approached a more neutral kind of rate sensitivity position, but I think beyond that, it's really going to depend on some of these other factors. The betas, the mix that Bill just talked about on the DDA side, whether or not we see credit spreads widen as an example, is a factor two. The beta that we have in our assumption around NII and NIM, you mentioned we're at 36% today. That until now, we've been exceeding our expectations just as the first quarter where we performed a little worse than we expected, our spot data today on a IBD basis is 40%. We expect that to migrate to the low-40s for the full second quarter, and we have a terminal outlook of 44%. John Pancari : Got it. Thanks, Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. I\u2019m not so faster, you are keep pushing the corvette analogy here, but it just looks like the fuel efficiency isn't quite as good. I don't know if you put diesel fuel in the corvette by mistake or what, but you closed 117 branches in the first quarter, so that should be good. You're getting other merger benefits. You've completed the integration phase and you guide for 5% to 7% revenue growth, which is decent, but also 5% to 7% expense growth. And isn't this the time when you go back to your management team and say, hey, we're getting more cautious on lending as you indicated. And we need to tighten some of this expense spend. And I get some of the expenses are FDIC and pension, minimum wage, but that's true at some of your peers, which are looking for positive operating leverage. I know you said positive operating leverage, but then you have 5% to 7% higher both for revenues and expenses. So just give a little bit more color about the efficiency of Truist as you transition from integration to growth. Thanks. Bill Rogers : Right. And Mike, I'm going to spare from the corvette analogies is just try to sort of go right at it. As Mike said, I mean, we're really -- we're going to continue to focus on positive operating leverage. The revenue guidance is really an NII guidance issue. Our continued focus on insurance, investment banking, all the other things that comprise that, we're still very confident of. And hopefully, if markets really improve in the second half of the year, might even have some upside. But your point on the expense side is exactly right. I mean, we have call it, 4% or so, sort of embedded in the categories that you talked about. So the ability to manage in that other component of that. And trust me, every business leader has a positive operating leverage plan, and they are readjusting those plans based on particularly those that have an NII component to their plans and the things that they can do. You saw already this quarter, things that we're doing that are more reflective of the strategy you talked about the realignment of fixed income, consolidation of LightStream. I mean in the past, these might have been things that sort of would have been off the table. Now they're firmly on the table like everything else as it relates to expenses. We'll do more work in the mortgage area, all the things with spans and layers, real estate, digitization, automation, all that is firmly on the table and a clear focus for us as we move into the rest of this year with a keen focus and eye on positive operating leverage. Mike Mayo : Okay. And then one separate question. Do you plan to rebrand LightStream to Truist? And if so, does that mean you're going to have more of a national branding strategy. And it's interesting, you're in the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic with Truist. You go outside the region with the different brands. So I'm just trying to reconcile your brand names. Bill Rogers : Yeah. Really sort of same way around actually. So we really -- we're going to eventually wind down the LightStream brand and increase the Truist side of that. We created LightStream for completely different reasons that don't really exist today as it relates to Truist. So we've got this incredible franchise, incredible market, really good digital capabilities. And what we're doing now is say, let's bring all those digital capabilities, really fast turnaround times, incredible Net Promoter Scores with LightStream to all the Truist client base. So the emphasis will be on the Truist client base and then also with partnerships that are Truist clients rather than sort of this national brands. So I'm pleased with what we did. I think we did all the right things. We created this really cool capability. But to the comment I made earlier, we are also supporting a separate brand, and that has a lot of expense associated with it. There's a lot of marketing and other things with that. And we're having incredible success with the Truist brand. So we want to bring it under that umbrella, create some more efficiencies from an expense standpoint and then I think accelerate from a revenue standpoint and penetrating and further cementing these incredible deposit relationships we have. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Bill Rogers : Thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead. And your line is now\u2026 Bill Rogers : Ebrahim, are you on mute. Ankur Vyas : Allay, maybe we just shift to the next person. Operator : And our next question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Hi. Good morning. Bill Rogers : Good morning. Erika Najarian : You mentioned that you \u2013 good morning. You're anticipating tighter capital and liquidity standards. And Bill, as you think about growing your capital from here, your starting point is 9.1. Do you feel like the build is now closer to 9.5 and 10 as you anticipate higher capital and liquidity standards. And if so, how should we think about your plans for dividend growth? I suspect that buybacks would be lowest priority? And also, is there some RWA mitigation that you could do in order to perhaps speed up that 20 basis points of organic capital generation. Bill Rogers : Yeah, Erika. Thanks. Remember, we're actually at 9.4 today, as we've completed the interest and Truist Insurance Holdings. So if we start with there, I mean the mode we're in right now, I mean, we're comfortable where our capital level is. But we're in a capital build mode right now until we're not. So we want to really understand the landscape, understand the regulatory landscape, be prepared. We've got 20 basis points or so of sort of organic capital accretion that comes into play. That's post our dividend. Our dividend will continue to be important to us, and we'll continue to support our dividend. So I think we've got -- we're at a good place right now with capital. We'll continue to be in a little bit of the capital build mode. So we'll sort of blow through that 9.5 number you mentioned here in several quarters. And then we'll see. We'll just sort of see where the regulatory things line up and the opportunities that we have. And I think we've got the most organic combined with financial and strategic flexibility on capital to respond to sort of anything that might come our way. You did mention though, our focus is going to continue to be on supporting organic growth. We're going to maximize RWA, but we don't need to reduce RWA. So that we don't need to change RWA from a capital standpoint. But we do want to optimize it. We do want to create more velocity around RWA, which I talked about. Dividend being important and then M&A on particularly things like insurance and then capabilities to create sustainable advantages. And then as you mentioned, share repurchase is just not in our short-term window. I mean that's just not our focus right now. Erika Najarian : Got it. And my second question is, sorry to make this another car (ph) analogy, a 24% ROTCE is more like an F1 car rather than a Corvette right. But the conversation on your AFS portfolio that was brewing over the quarter aside, it feels like some of what's holding now in your valuation is the puts and takes the specials that keep coming up. And I wonder, Bill, where are you in terms of the optimization of this franchise because it's pretty clear that the steps that you have been taking and it seems like based on Mike's laundry list that you are accelerating has everything to do with the optimization of this franchise. And I wonder how you're weighing sort of pulling forward that optimization. And I mean, look, there's always a continuous improvement process for every company, right? But is it better to just clean everything up this year and perhaps for the sake of positive operating leverage to think about cleaner '24 and '25 numbers when it comes to the expenses. Because I do think that it's very clear what the potential of this franchise is, but there's always adjustments here and there. And so I feel like your investors are less likely to see that visibility on that expense curve bend that you guys are aiming for? Bill Rogers : Yeah. Let me try to break that up into two components, if I understood the question. So the question is around the strategic parts of our business and optimizing those, you are seeing a little bit of an acceleration around there. That's not sort of a dramatic shift, but you're all seeing a speed up in that, and it's things around the edges. And I talked a little bit about those today. There are some more of those that we're thinking through. Because as you know, I mean, our core franchise is so powerful. And what we want to do is make sure that the resources that we have at this company are devoted towards growing, expanding that incredible franchise. So the things that we talked about, about capital markets and LightStream, I think, are really good examples of those. And you could argue they were probably a little accelerated maybe with a small A of accelerating. If you're going to the balance sheet side, are we going to do anything on the securities portfolio, the answer to that is not at this time. I mean there's just not a really good economic benefit for that, and we want to be long-term protectors of shareholder value. And so I think we'll stay the course there unless something were to change dramatically that would cause us to change our posture. Did that [indiscernible], Erika? Erika Najarian : Yeah. I was just wondering if -- just a follow-up, it seems as if you have optimized and accelerated some of the initiatives and I'm wondering, if you can tell your investors that your goal for '24 is really sort of cleaner quarters on expenses so that they could really see that expense curve in terms of your GAAP EPS power? Bill Rogers : Yeah. I think relative to the first part of that, yes, that would be the goal. And I think they\u2019re getting cleaner every quarter, and they\u2019re going to continue to stay on that flight path. But when we have opportunities that we think are long-term beneficial, we\u2019re not going to miss those. But I think your basic statement of we\u2019ll be \u2013 will we have a cleaner quarter process in \u201824, yes. And I think they get cleaner every quarter along that path. Erika Najarian : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Bill. Good morning, Mike. Bill Rogers : Good morning. Gerard Cassidy : Mike, and maybe this is more directed to Clarke on credit. You guys had very strong credit quality, obviously. But you perked my interest with something that you said in the prepared remarks that charge-offs, again, they're low, went up by 3 basis points. But you cited C&I, which was interesting to me. So the question is, and then you also pointed out that the allowance, of course, was built up for CRE, but you talked about you're reducing your risk appetite in selected areas. So where are those areas, number one? And then in C&I, if you guys could elaborate what -- maybe what happened there in comments also about your leverage loan portfolio that I assume is included in the C&I as well. Clarke Starnes : Great. Hey, Gerard. Bill Rogers : Hey, Clarke. Why don't you start with [indiscernible] there. Clarke Starnes : So as far as what areas are we focused on, first and foremost, what I'd say is that we want to maintain our through-the-cycle lending approach as we always have for our clients. So we're not going to make dramatic shifts in our appetite or how we lend. We just want to be more cautious and prudent where it makes sense. So things like less exceptions, more due diligence and some of the areas we're focused on right now would be the ones you would expect, higher leverage. So leverage finance would be one, things like senior care given the market aspects of CRE, lower-end consumer, things like that, Gerard. So I think it's more around being cautious, but being consistent there for our clients. And to your other question, our leverage book is performing very well right now. So I would just remind you all the portion that you would be focused on is about 3.6% of our total loans. Portfolio is 50% investment grade. We have very modest hold levels. Our leverage multiples have come down over the last couple of years in that book. And right now, it's performing very well. We have NPLs at 0.6%. Our NCOs are at 0.11%. So very good overall performance. And then as far as the C&I losses in Q1, there's nothing episodic there. We're coming off such extremely low levels. If we go back into 2022, we were in just a couple of basis point range, and we were up just more toward a normalized range. So nothing specific there. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you, Clarke. And then following up, Mike, you talked about the investment banking business, how you've built it out with some strategic hires over the last two years. And we know from the market conditions from some of your larger competitors, it's challenging out there. Are you guys comfortable with your revenue to expense area in investment banking now or do you really want to see or need the revenues to kind of really pick up as the market conditions pick up? Mike Maguire : Yeah. I'll start there and maybe Bill may have something to add. But the investment banking business is performing well. It was a bright spot for us. In the first quarter, we have expectations that it will continue to perform well. Pipelines remain solid. And I think that a lot of that is driven by the fact that we've been adding really high caliber sort of franchise type talent to that platform, not just recently but consistently over the years. And so look, I mean, there's no doubt about it. There's market interruptions, transaction markets, deal markets are a little harder. But in sort of the middle market and upper middle market space, where we feel like we've really got a powerful franchise, we continue to get deals done for our clients on the corporate and sponsor side. And so we're still very supportive and optimistic about the investment banking business. And look, we're managing it carefully and revenues will be highly correlated with expenses in that business, but that's always been the case. Bill Rogers : Yeah. And for us, to your margin question, investment banking business always been a good margin business and has had a lot of discipline over a long period of time. And part of that sustainability, I think you saw some of it this quarter is back to the earlier comments and questions were having about the strength of the franchise. So being able to take advantage of this incredible franchise and client base really afford us this opportunity all across high grade, debt and equity, earn revenue being up. So it just creates more consistency and more confidence for us in that revenue base. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you for the insights gentlemen. Ankur Vyas : Allay, we've got time for one more question. Operator : And we'll take our last question from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. John McDonald : Hi. Good morning. I know we're running tight. Maybe we could get a comments from John about the operating environment for insurance this year. And then also if you could add on your thoughts about utilizing the increased optionality that the transaction has gotten you and what the M&A environment looks like for you? Thanks. Bill Rogers : Hey, John. Do you want to\u2026 John Howard : Sure, John. This is John Howard. Thank you very much for the question. When I look at the environment from an insurance standpoint, it continues to be favorable. Pricing continues to be firm, if you think about insured values and you think about insured rates, they are both affected by the inflationary environment that we're experiencing. Those are tailwinds for us. There are some capacity headwinds, particularly around catastrophe exposed property. But net-net, we'll continue to see good organic growth in insurance. And I do expect our organic growth to improve over the course of the year. And to your question about acquisitions, the market response to the Stone Point transaction has been very positive. So we've gotten great feedback from teammates, clients, insurance companies, business partners as well as acquisition candidates. So I think we're very well positioned. John McDonald : Great. Thanks.

Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Mr. Brad Milsaps, Head of Investor Relations, Truist Financial Corporation. Brad Milsaps : Thank you, Tarren, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist's second quarter 2023 earnings call. With us today are our Chairman and CEO, Bill Rogers; and our CFO, Mike Maguire. During this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's second quarter results, share their perspectives on current business conditions and provide an updated outlook for 2023. Clarke Starnes, our Vice Chair and Chief Risk Officer; Beau Cummins, our Vice Chair; and John Howard, Truist Insurance Holdings ' Chairman and CEO are also in attendance and are available to participate in the Q&A portion of our call. The accompanying presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the Truist Investor Relations website ir.truist.com. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on slides two and three of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix for appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. With that, I'll now turn it over to Bill. Bill Rogers : Thanks, Brad, and welcome to the team. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call today. I don't think it's a surprise to anybody on this call that the increasing levels of uncertainty in our economy, the impact of interest rates on funding cost, and a new sort of post-March operating environment for our industry are impacting our results and plans. Truist was specifically built to increase our flexibility to respond to any condition to fulfill our purpose and commitment to all stakeholders. Capital and liquidity have taken on an increased focus and although Truist is currently well-positioned. We're also intensely building future flexibility. This environment also challenges us to move faster with greater intensity to tighten our strategic focus and rightsize our expense chassis to reflect the new realities. We also have flexibility in strengthening our balance sheet to support our focus on our unique core client base and market opportunity. These decisions are less incremental and more time-bound than the ones previously made during our shift from integrating to operating. Mike will highlight some of these decisions in his comments and I'll close with some of the underlying momentum. While these changes will be manifested over time, this is not business as usual and reflects an important and significant pivot for Truist and for our leadership team. We'll provide more details about these topics and our second quarter results throughout the presentation. Before we do that, let me start where I always do on slide four on purpose mission and values. Truist is a purpose-driven company dedicated to inspiring and building better lives and communities. I'd like to share some of the ways we brought that purpose to life last quarter. In May, we announced the launch of Truist Long Game, our mobile app that leverages behavioral economics to reward clients for building financial wellness at a high-level user set goals, save money and earn rewards that are deposited into a Truist account as they make progress towards their savings goals. Based on early data, users tend to play four to five times a week with strong retention and we've seen positive trends towards new client acquisition. This is also the first product from our Truist Foundry, our very own start-up tasked with creating digital solutions to help meet clients where they are. Truist has also highlighting small-business owners through a small-business Community Heroes initiative which is all about focusing on the small-business owners who worked tirelessly to serve our neighbors, create jobs and build our communities and help drive our economy. Our branch teammates are visiting and connecting with tens of thousands of small business clients to say thank you and have a carrying conversation to assist with their unique needs. The response so far has really been excellent and our outreach efforts have helped drive a 31% increase in net new small business checking accounts during the second quarter alone. Lastly, I want to thank our teammates, who dedicated more than 16,000 hours during the second quarter to volunteer in their communities. I'm really proud of the good work our company and our teammates are doing to live out our purpose and to make a difference in the lives of their clients, teammates and communities. So let's turn to the second quarter performance highlights on slide six. Second quarter results were mixed overall. Net income available to common in the second quarter was $1.2 billion or $0.92 a share. EPS decreased 16% relative to the year-ago quarter, primarily due to a higher loan loss provision and noninterest expense partially offset by higher net interest income. EPS decreased 12% sequentially as higher funding costs pressure net interest income. Total revenue decreased 2.9% sequentially, consistent with our revised guidance, and a 6.1% decrease in net interest income was partially offset by 2.6% increase in fee income led by record results at Truist Insurance Holdings. Adjusted expenses were within our existing guidance range although we are actively working to manage cost even more intensely. Loan balances were relatively stable and we're pleased with the initial progress we've made to reposition the balance sheet for higher return core assets, especially in consumer, though there's always additional work to do. Average deposits were down 2% largely due to client activity in March, the overall deposit trends have stabilized significantly since that time frame and our conversations with our clients and our pipelines have improved. We're also prudently increasing our provision and allowance due to increased economic uncertainty. At the same time, our CET1 capital ratio increased 50 basis points driven by organic capital generation and the sale of a 20% stake in our insurance business. These same factors drove a 5% increase in tangible book value per share for March 31st. Our stress capital buffer increased from 250 basis points to 290 basis points higher than we think our steady state business model warrants, but still a good performance as Truist had the fourth lowest loan loss rates among traditional banks that participate in the stress test reflecting again our conservative credit culture and diverse loan portfolio. We also announced plans to maintain our strong quarterly common stock dividend at $0.52 a share subject to Board approval. Strategically, we continue to optimize our franchise and focus our resources on our core clients and businesses, which is why we made the strategic decision to sell a $5 billion non-core student loan portfolio at net carrying value which has no upfront P&L impact. We're also making solid progress toward shifting our loan mix towards higher return core assets. As we adapt to the current environment, we're highly focused on doubling down on our core franchise, simplifying where it makes sense, rationalizing our expenses, and building capital, all of which will address later in the presentation. So moving to the digital and technology update on slide seven. Digital engagement trends remain positive, reinforcing the importance of continued investment in digital due to its close association with relationship primacy client experience and account growth. As a proof point, we recently enhanced our digital on-boarding experience through a series of platform enhancements resulting in higher conversion rates for new applications, faster funding and higher average digital account balances. Our growing mobile app user base is also driving increased transaction volumes. Digital transactions grew 5% sequentially and now account for 61% of total bank transactions. Zelle transactions increased 12% compared to the first quarter and now account for one-third of all-digital transactions at Truist, which underscores the importance our clients place on our payments and money movement capabilities. Retail digital client satisfaction scores have also returned to their pre-merger highs. We are proud of our third-place ranking in the Javelin 2023 Mobile Banking Scorecard. From an overall client experience and technology perspective, we continue to enhance our capability set that includes recent improvements to our cloud-based self-service digital assistant Truist Assist since implementing these enhancements several months ago, Truist Assist has hosted over 500,000 conversations with more than 380,000 clients and is connected clients to live agents to support more than 100,000 complex needs via LiveChat. Over time, increased utilization of Truist Assist should lead to lower volumes in our call centers. We're also delivering on our commitment to T3, through the launch of our Truist Insights to our small business heroes earlier this month. Truist Insights on power small businesses by providing actionable insights about financial activities, including cash flows, income and expense and proactive balanced monitoring. We first piloted Truist Insights in 2021 and this year alone have generated over 200 million financial insights for more than 4.5 million clients, who are now delivering the best valuable tool to small businesses. This is just one more way we're bringing touch and technology together to build trust and to help our small business clients bank with confidence, where and how they want. Overall, I'm highly optimistic that our investments in innovation and digital and technology will enhance performance and further improve the client experience. Let me turn to loans and leases on slide eight. Loan growth continues to be correlated with the solid progress we've made to shift our loan mix towards more profitable portfolios and core clients while intentionally pulling back from lower-yielding and certain single-product relationships. Average loan balances were stable sequentially as growth in our commercial portfolio was largely offset by lower consumer balances. Commercial loan growth was driven by seasonality and mortgage warehouse lending and continued growth in traditional C&I which is a core area for us. The decline in average consumer balances was primarily due to indirect auto where we've intentionally reduced production, home equity, residential mortgage and student loan balances also declined and I'll provide more details about the sale of the student loan portfolio in a few moments. At the same time, we're seeing strong results from our Service Finance and Sheffield businesses where second quarter production grew 34% and 21% respectively from the year ago quarter. Service Finance continues to perform very well and take market share and consistent with our balance sheet optimization we'll increase our loan sale opportunities to help support its growth. As I mentioned, we made the strategic decision to sell our $5 billion non-core student loan portfolio, which had been running off at a pace of approximately $400 million per quarter. We sold the student loan book in late June and net carrying value with no upfront P&L impact. Proceeds from the sale were used to reduce other wholesale funding. The transaction will modestly hurt NII, but boost NIM and balance sheet efficiency, exactly what we should be doing in an environment where cost of capital and funding has increased meaningfully. Moving forward, we'll continue to better focus our balance sheet on Truist clients who have broader relationships while limiting our exposure to single product and indirect clients as well as evaluate ways to increase the velocity overall of our balance sheet. Now let me provide some perspective on overall deposit trends on slide nine. Average deposits decreased $8.7 billion or 2.1% primarily due to seasonal tax payments and outflows that occurred late in the first quarter and were consistent with industry impacts of quantitative tightening. We continue to experience remixing within our deposit portfolio as noninterest-bearing deposits decreased to 31% of total deposits from 32% in the first quarter and 34% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Interest-bearing deposit costs increased 55 basis points sequentially and our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta was 44%, up from 36% in the first quarter due to the continued presence of higher rate alternatives and the ongoing shift from noninterest-bearing accounts to higher-yielding products. We continue to remain a balanced approach in the current environment being attentive to client needs and relationships while also striving to maximize value outside of rate paid. Our continued rollout of Truist One and ongoing investments in treasury and payments are the bullseye of our sharpened strategic focus and will remain critical as we look to acquire new relationships, deepen existing ones and maximize high quality deposit growth. Now let me turn it over to Mike to discuss our financial results in a little more detail. Mike Maguire : Great. Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin with net interest income on slide 10. For the quarter, taxable equivalent net interest income decreased 6.1% sequentially as higher funding costs more than offset the benefits of higher rates on earning assets. Reported net interest margin decreased 26 basis points to 2.91% due primarily to an acceleration of interest-bearing deposit betas and mix-shift out of DDA into other high cost alternatives. The lower net interest margin also reflected our liquidity build late in the first quarter, while liquidity remained elevated throughout April and May, it has normalized by June and will provide some modest boost in NIM going forward. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income is still up 7.1%, and core net interest margin is up 13 basis points. This reflects the cumulative benefit we've seen from the rising rates during the cycle, particularly throughout 2022, but now we are losing some of that benefit in 2023. Moving to fee income on slide 11. Fee income rebounded 2.6% relative to the first quarter. Insurance income increased $122 million sequentially to a record $935 million, demonstrating the strength of Truist Insurance Holdings. Year-over-year organic revenue grew by 9.1%, the highest in four quarters, driven by strong new business growth, improved retention and a favorable pricing backdrop. Other income increased $65 million primarily due to higher income from our non-qualified plan and higher other investment income. In contrast, investment banking and trading income decreased $50 million, reflecting lower bond originations, loan syndications and asset securitizations as well as lower core trading income from derivatives and credit trading. Finally, mortgage banking income increased or may decreased $43 million, with most of the decrease related to prior quarter gain on sale of a servicing portfolio. Turning to non-interest expense on slide 12. Adjusted noninterest expense increased $67 million or 1.9% sequentially. The increase in adjusted expenses reflected a $75 million increase in personnel costs due to higher variable compensation and non-qualified plan expense and a $38 million increase in professional fees associated with enterprise technology and other investments. These increases were partially offset by a $41 million reduction and other expenses due to lower operational losses during the quarter. As a company, we have substantial opportunities to operate more efficiently and are committed to generating expense reductions. On the April earnings call, we discussed a strategic realignment within our fixed-income sales and trading business in which we discontinued certain market making activities and services provided by middle-market fixed-income platforms that had an unattractive ROE. We also identified various expense reduction activities that had already been underway, including realigning our LightStream platform to our broader consumer business and ongoing capacity adjustments to market-sensitive businesses such as mortgage. We're actively working to identify and accelerate additional actions that could be implemented over the course of the next 12 to 18 months to generate cost reductions to reflect efficiency opportunities and changing conditions. These actions include taking a much more aggressive approach towards FTE management, realigning and consolidating businesses to advance our long-term strategy, rationalizing our tech spend to drive more efficient and effective delivery and optimizing our operations and contact centers, which will help us transform Truist into a more effective and efficient company. Taken together, we believe these actions will increase our focus, double down on our core, simplify our business, bend the expense curve, and enhance returns for our shareholders. Moving to slide 13, asset quality metrics reflected continued normalization during the second quarter. Nonperforming loans rose 11 basis points primarily due to increases in our CRE and C&I portfolios, though they remain manageable at 47 basis points. While the increase in CRE, nonperforming loans, include some office, these loans are generally paying as agreed. Our net charge-off ratio was 54 basis points inclusive of a 12 basis point impact from the sale of the student loan portfolio, excluding the student loan sale, net charge-offs were 42 basis points up 5 basis points sequentially. We'd also note that the student loan sale had no impact on our provision expense this quarter as the charge-offs taken in conjunction with the sale was essentially equal to the allowance on the portfolio. During the quarter, we also increased our ALLL ratio 6 basis points to 1.43% due to greater economic uncertainty. Consistent with our commentary last quarter, we have tightened credit and reduced our risk appetite in select areas though we maintain our through-the-cycle approach for high-quality long-term clients. Next, I'll provide more details on our CRE portfolio, which takes us to slide 14. On June 30th, CRE, including commercial construction represented 8.9% of loans held for investment, while the office segment comprised only 1.6%. We maintain a high-quality CRE portfolio through disciplined risk management and prudent client selection. We typically work with developers and sponsors we know well and have observed their performance through multiple cycles. Our larger exposures tend to be associated with sponsors that have strong institutional ownership and we have actively managed less strategic exposures out of the portfolio since the close of the merger. Looking at office in particular, the chart at the lower right provides a breakdown of our office portfolio by tenant and Class. Our office exposure tends to be weighted towards multi-tenant Class A properties that are situated within our footprint. All factors that we believe will drive outperformance. In addition, we have a strong CRE team that is highly proactive in working with clients to get ahead of the problems. During the second quarter, we completed a thorough review of the majority of our CRE office exposure. We considered current conditions and client support in our risk rating approach. As a result, a handful of loans were moved to non-accrual, though the preponderance of the clients in exposure are paying as agreed. We believe our actions are prudent in light of current market dynamics and demonstrate our commitment to proactive and early identification and resolution of credit risk. While problem loans have increased in recent months, we believe overall issues will be manageable in light of our laddered maturity profile, conservative LTVs, and reserves which for office totaled 6.2% of loans held for investment. Turning to capital on slide 15. As you can see from the capital waterfall, Truist is well-capitalized and has significant flexibility to respond to potential changes in the risk and regulatory environment. Beginning on the left, CET1 capital increased 50 basis points to 9.6% at June 30th. This was driven by organic capital generation and the completion of the sale of the 20% stake in Truist Insurance Holdings. I would also point out that at 9.6%, we're well above our new regulatory minimum of 7.4% which takes effect on October 1st. We expect to achieve an approximate 10% CET1 ratio by year-end through a combination of organic capital generation and disciplined management of RWA growth. This view does contemplate the headwind from the pending FDIC assessment. On top of this, Truist has more than 200 basis points of additional flexibility given the residual 80% ownership stake in Truist Insurance Holdings. As we look beyond '23, we do expect regulatory and capital requirements to become more stringent and potentially require us to deduct AOCI from our CET1 ratio, while the final form of any regulatory changes remains to be seen Truist is well-positioned to respond due to our strong organic capital generation and the likely phasing periods of any potential new requirement. Specifically, and as shown on the right-hand side of the slide, based on estimated cash flows and assuming today's forward curve, we would expect Truist AOCI to decline by 36% by the end of 2026. Assuming our current rate of organic capital generation remains constant, Truist should generate sufficient capital to offset the estimated remaining impact of AOCI on CET1 over this time period while maintaining the strategic capital flexibility with Truist Insurance Holdings. And now I will review our updated guidance on slide 16. Looking into the third quarter of 2023, we expect revenues to be down 4% due to seasonally lower insurance revenue and slightly lower loan balances, which will lead to continued pressure on net interest income, albeit at a slower pace relative to the decline we experienced in the second quarter. Adjusted expenses are anticipated to decline zero to 1% as seasonally lower insurance commissions and our efforts to bend the expense curve will offset several seasonal headwinds like marketing and employee benefits that should change the tailwinds in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2023, we now expect revenues to increase 1% to 2% compared to 2022. The decline from our previous outlook for 3% growth is primarily driven by lower net interest income due to higher deposit betas, slower loan growth and lower investment banking revenue. Adjusted expenses are expected to increase 7%, which is at the upper end of our previously guided range due to continued investments in enterprise technology and other areas. This excludes the anticipated FDIC surcharge. This is a number that is higher than where we've been targeting, but as we've discussed, we are pursuing a number of actions to reduce costs. In terms of asset quality, our expectation is for the net charge-off ratio to be between 40 and 50 basis points, which includes the impact of the student loan sale. Finally, we expect an effective tax rate of 19% or 21% on a taxable equivalent basis. Now Bill, I'll hand it back to you for some final remarks. Bill Rogers : Great. Thanks, Mike. So let's conclude on slide 17. We're on the right path and I'm highly optimistic about our ability to realize our significant post-integration potential as summarized in our investment thesis. Our goal financially is to provide strong growth and profitability and to do so with less volatility than our peers. Our strategic pivot from integrating to operating is well underway. And while the financial benefits of our pivot have been masked by the rapid increase in funding costs and related revenue pressure, we've made significant strategic progress over the past year and showing up in a number of operating metrics across our business. In our Consumer Banking and Wealth segments, Retail and Small Business Banking net new checking production has been positive during four last five quarters, reflecting the success of Truist One and improved retention associated with our increasing client service metrics. Truist One also has many features that appeal to millennials and Gen Z represent 70% of the new client applications. Our Wealth Trust and Brokerage business continues to build momentum as net organic asset flows, which exclude the impact of market value changes have been positive eight of the last nine quarters. We've also steadily improved client satisfaction through the distinctive service provided by our branches and care agents as well as improvements to our digital processes and procedures that originated in our client journey rooms. As a result, our client satisfaction scores were stable to improving across most of our channels during the second quarter, but have been consistently rising over the past year since the integration. In Corporate and Commercial, we continue to focus on left lead loan transactions and the synergies between our CIB and CCB businesses. During the first half of the year, 25% of the left lead transactions closed by Truist were with our CCB clients. We're also making inroads with new CCB clients as 65% of the CCB left leads I just mentioned were new relationships. In equity capital markets, transaction economics have improved approximately 300 basis points on average since the merger. And in wholesale payments, our pipeline is the highest it's been since the merger. Each of these data points reflects our increasing strategic relevance with our clients. In addition, our IRM program, integrated relationship management is off to a great start this year as we've already delivered nearly 50% more IRM solutions year-to-date than during the same period a year ago. Our strong progress demonstrates what is possible post-integration when our teammates can focus their undivided attention on caring for their clients and deepening those relationships. However, just as we're shifting our focus from integrate to operate, the economic landscape shifted from favorable to more challenging. As a result, we too much shift and make tough decisions to fit the realities of today's economic environment and tomorrow's regulatory requirements. This means being more disciplined about where we choose to compete and deploy our capital, whether businesses, clients or products and looking deeper and more -- more structural cost opportunities that exist at Truist. These opportunities exist, but not the primary focus during the integration period where the focus was on creating the best transition possible for clients and teammates. Mike highlighted many of the specifics earlier while the details are critically important, what will ultimately matter to stakeholders is our absolute expense base and growth, and our teams are aligned internally on changing that trajectory. I'm really truly optimistic about the future of Truist as our unwavering foundation of purpose, our talented teammates, leadership in growth markets and diverse business model will continue to drive our momentum and fulfill our potential. So Brad, let me turn it back over to you for Q&A. Brad Milsaps : Thank you, Bill. Tarren, at this time, will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session, as you do that, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourselves to one primary question and one follow-up in order that we may accommodate as many of you as possible today. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So I just wanted to follow-up, of course, it makes sense that the funding cost and slower loan growth is part of the change in the revenue outlook. I'm just wondering as you look forward and you think about that deposit mix and deposit cost trajectory as far as funding cost looking past the second quarter, how do you see that affecting the NII trajectory within that new revenue guide for the third and fourth? Thanks, guys. Mike Maguire : Hey, good morning, Ken. It's Mike. I'd say as we think about the rest of the year, the same factors that have been driving, I'd say just Average Balance QT primarily in the second quarter, we had a little bit more of an impact from tax payments will continue. The mixing has been pretty consistent too from a noninterest-bearing demand perspective into higher-cost alternatives. We saw a little bit of an acceleration in the first quarter as you'll recall, but this quarter that stabilized a bit. We were down about 5.5% on those balances and remix from I guess 32% to 31%. We would expect that trend to continue as well. I think really the factor as we think about NII trajectory for the third and the fourth quarter has much more to do with sort of the Fed policy track, right, where we had about call it close to 50 basis points average increase in the Fed funds rate in the second quarter which really did have an impact on our betas, in our funding costs, we would expect that to be about half that in the third quarter and further moderating from there. Ken Usdin : And just on the follow-up, what do you think that means for kind of the view of where you think terminal interest-bearing beta might land? Mike Maguire : It's tough. We're at 44% today, that's higher than where we expect it to be. I think we -- as recently as a month or so ago expressed an expectation that maybe mid-to-high 40s would be the case. I think certainly piercing 50%, but really hard to pick a number at this point, Ken, to be honest with you, a lot of it I think has to do with how long we're higher for longer. Ken Usdin : Yeah. That makes sense. Okay, thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning. I guess maybe the first question, Mike, just following up on what -- your response to Ken around just the change in deposit beta expectations even relative to last month. Are they -- like when we think about what you said on deposit beta outlook, are there any real signs that are suggesting that deposit trends are in fact slowing down and the likelihood of the beta -- deposit beta update you provided today is more likely to play-out versus having to change this again next month. I'm just wondering are you seeing any tangible signs on the ground that suggest things are getting better? Mike Maguire : You know it's -- we look at it on a weekly, monthly basis, Ebrahim. And so, I think, yeah. I mean I think history would say that as we approach and reach this terminal policy rate, we should start to see some moderation in the beta creep. We're starting to see that a little bit, but a month or a few weeks the trend does not make, and so, just being very cautious on the outlook there. I mean at 5.25 going to 5.50, the degree of rate awareness across our client set is very, very high across the industry is very, very high. And so, look I -- and I think that's probably as much as anything driven the miss on betas for the sector so far. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And I guess, a separate question, you've talked a lot -- both you and Bill, throughout the call around wanting to bend the cost curve and the expense focus. I know you're not giving '24 guidance today, but as we think about the opportunity there, I'm just wondering if you can put some framework around what we should expect around what this entails with regards to just quantifying it. Bill Rogers : Yeah. I'll take that. And without again trying to sort of provide specific guidance because we have a lot of things that we're working on. If you think about sort of the buildup, so the buildup was related to things that are investing to build a large financial institution, and then we had some unique onetime things to us, that are things like pension accounting and then we had acquisitions and part of that. So to say a couple of things, I mean, we're clearly at an inflection point in the growth rate. So the growth rate is going to change materially and you can sort of see that by our guidance for the year relative to where we are right now. So that will give you an impression of where we think the third and fourth quarter will be from a growth perspective. And I think similarly sort of on an absolute basis for the balance of this year, we'd expect to see some of that absolute level of expenses coming down, but the real change comes in the structural opportunities that Mike talked about, the things that we're working on. So we can bend the curve in lots of ways that are incremental, but I think the big opportunity for us is sort of the fundamental components in terms of how our company is structured, how it runs, what the chassis looks like, what are the businesses that we're in. And that's the work that we're doing, and that's the big work of post-integration to running the company in a way that reflects the current environment. So, what I would say, maybe I'll use the word appreciably. So expenses will be down appreciably. And as we get into this latter part of this year, we'll provide a lot more guidance and thought about 2024. Ebrahim Poonawala : Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Operator : For our next question we'll turn to Erika Najarian with UBS. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. And I apologize in advance if it feels like everyone's asking the same question, but I think it's important for investors to have clarity. Mike, just on the net interest income trajectory, I apologize that we're asking you to spoon-feed it to us, and for everybody could model it later, but investors are really thinking about what the exit rate for the fourth quarter will be -- and potentially overlay your net interest income sensitivity that you disclosed in your Q which at down 100 basis points, just down 70 basis points would imply pretty good stability from fourth quarter levels. So I guess I'm wondering from the 3, 6, 7, and 9, what is the range of NII outcomes that you expect for the fourth quarter and do you agree with -- that notion that if the Fed does cut 100 basis points, which a lot of investors are putting in their models, there is going to be relative stability in terms of your net interest income power next year? Mike Maguire : Yeah. No, Erika, don't mind at all -- the follow-up question here. So a couple of things, yes. I mean, look, we are according to our NII sensitivity disclosure, relatively neutral and I'd say based on where we are in the cycle and how in particular betas are performing, we're probably even a little bit more liability sensitive to that then that and you see that in our results. We're not currently contemplating a cut this year, and when we talked about our expectations in the middle of June, we were thinking about a cut as early as this year, we've updated our rate view to a -- up 25 at the next meeting and then holding until probably mid '24. So that probably is what's influencing our revenue guide for the rest of this year and especially the NII component, but yeah, I mean, just to get to your question, if we saw it down 100, that would absolutely be a stabilizing force and would be a nice tailwind for our NII based on how we're positioned. Erika Najarian : And within guide -- go ahead, Bill. Bill Rogers : Hey, Erika. No, let me just add a couple of things, because we're really talking about sort of betas and NII and we also need to shift talk about client and client activity, which is also an important part of it. So the tailwind that we're creating about net, net deposit growth expansion, IRM, primacy with relationships and then on the pricing side, I mean we're starting to see some of that pricing flexibility, particularly on the commercial side. So spread over SOFR probably 20 some plus basis points quarter-to-quarter. So the ability to be more relevant to our clients reposition our portfolio to reflect that be in higher returning, quite frankly taking some market share, where others are backing off, we're leaning into some opportunities that have a greater return for. So in addition to all the betas and the other components, there's just a lot of really good underlying client activity that's tailwind. Erika Najarian : Got it. And just a follow-up question and then I'll step aside. Mike, I guess, let me ask this a different way within the down or up one to two in terms of adjusted revenue, what is the NII outlook there -- embedded there? Mike Maguire : Yeah. No problem. So, our expectation is that in the third quarter with a single rate hike -- our -- it will continue on a downward trajectory but at a much more moderate pace, call it half of what we saw in the second quarter. And I think you would expect the pressure to decline even further in the fourth quarter. Erika Najarian : Perfect. Thank you. Mike Maguire : Talking about NII, yeah. You got it. Operator : Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Thanks so much. Just one quick follow-on to this discussion regarding the noninterest-bearing component. I know you mentioned earlier that you expect the noninterest-bearing to remix just to stabilize here and I'm just wondering in your NII outlook where are you expecting noninterest-bearing to trend and where do you feel that, that will stabilize? Thanks. Mike Maguire : It's been remixing at about 1% a quarter for us that was about $7 billion in average balance, and 5.5% in the quarter. I would expect that trend to continue at that rate. We spent a lot of time last quarter talking about where that might ultimately land. I think there's a chance that that rate of a percent or whatever 5% to 6% a quarter does begin to moderate some here. Bill and I both talked about sort of maybe it's a mid-20s terminal mix of DDA, but even now I think is in many respects and estimate and trying to rely on pre-pandemic and even pre -- back to the pre-GFC proxy. So, Betsy, I don't know that helps or not, but we are assuming that DDA will continue to decline in the third and the fourth quarter, again, the second quarter is a little tougher because of the tax payments and the likes. Betsy Graseck : Right. Got it. Okay. Thanks. And then just shifting the conversation a little bit towards the capital. I see -- your slide 15 on the significant capital momentum and flexibility that you've got, maybe you could just frame for us how you're thinking about what's the right level for you as we're thinking through what regulation could come through here next week supposedly, we're going to have some new proposals come out and then give us a sense as to buyback capacity and where you're thinking about that at this stage? Thanks. Bill Rogers : Yeah, Betsey. This is Bill. So I think the position right now as we continue to build. And so, the targets are developing, more information is coming, and we'll know more over the next 90 days in terms of different proposals and impact on us. And really what this slide was meant to do rather than show sort of an absolute level or a target was really to show the flexibility and the organic creation of capital that we have. So we start from a good position of 9.6 will be organically at 10 end of this year without sort of doing anything dramatic related to risk-weighted assets sort of staying on the process that we're on. And then we just have a lot of flexibility that the AOCI sort of runs off, and then we have -- and we just have other flexibility. So we'll know more as it develops. But I think we're in left lane of capital accretion and we'll stay in that mode until we're not. And that same thing applies to any buybacks or whatnot. We sort of have to understand where the stopping point is before we make any comment about buybacks. And today, that would be short-term, not on the table as we're building capital. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks and appreciate that AOCI burn down. Very helpful. Thanks. Bill Rogers : Yeah. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. The floor is yours. Mike Mayo : Hi. I want to recognize that accelerated capital pass CET1 10% by year-end. So certainly progress with capital. But otherwise, Bill, I need help in understanding how you can say you're on the right path. One, you had a merger, an end-market merger, an end-market merger predicated on cost synergies, and here we are over three years later and your efficiency ratio in the second quarter is 63% worse than peer. Second, your new guide is for '23 operating leverage -- negative operating leverage of 500 basis points to 600 basis points and to build the revenue guide was lowered by 500 basis points in your expense guide, what's the high-end of your prior range, your personnel expenses are up 3% quarter-over-quarter and 7% year-over-year. And then three, you talked about bending the cost curve, but over the past three years, you've mentioned when I hood was open, you said let's invest more than it was investing more for growth. Now I hear you say you're investing more in enterprise tech. So, from the merger is predicated on cost synergies, the guide is for big negative operating leverage, you are still spending more. So I understand the employee should be happy. They are being paid more. The customers are happy. You have strong relationships. The communities are happy. You're immersed in them. But the shareholders, I think, I can safely say are not happy, I mean, not happy about the expense growth, and they're not happy about the negative operating leverage. And it just seems like -- I love you personally, but I just wonder if you've just been a little too soft and not taking the tougher actions like some of your peers have. So correct my logic or thinking or my observations, if you would. Bill Rogers : Thanks, Mike, and appreciate the love, but right back at you. So I think -- so a couple of things. One is maybe a challenge a little bit the merger was predicated on cost saves alone. Remember the merger was predicated on opportunity as well, an opportunity in our markets, and we want to make sure that we're well positioned to take advantage of those. So when I talk about sort of being on track, I don't want you to think that, that satisfaction about where we are from an expense side. Building the infrastructure for a large company in this environment was more expensive than we anticipated, so there's just no doubt about that. And, but to that point, I think we're at a really good inflection point. And that inflection point is a pivot. The intensity I can assure you hear around expenses, but not just expenses, but just redesigning the chassis. I mean, there are lots of easy things you can do. You can do hiring freezes and those type of things and we're underway on all that, and you'll start to see some of that in the next couple of quarters, but our commitment is to really underchange the fundamental structure and the business model that results of this. So there are certain businesses. We talked about student loan would be an example that we're we've been supporting from an expense standpoint that just doesn't fit into our strategy and doesn't make sense, so we'll evaluate other parts of our business and other parts of our support structure that are part of that. You could argue we should have been doing that faster. I think that's a legitimate push, and I accept that, but I don't want to think that it's not happening. And that focus is intense, but it is about trying to create more permanent change than structural. I mean let's make the next quarter lower. Let's really change the fundamental structure of the company from an expense standpoint. You've seen me do it before, and you know we can do it again. So my confidence comes from the fact that we've got a team that's committed to this, and the plans that I see and the focus that we have. This is an inflection point from that standpoint in this quarter. Mike Mayo : So you mentioned you'll come back with some plan for 12 to 18 months. And I know, look, I know you wanted to have positive operating leverage in the environment worked against you partly and you acknowledge there are some other things internally. But it looks like it's going be tough to get positive operating leverage in 2024. Is that something you're going to shoot for? And when do we hear about these new expense plans over the next 12 to 18 months? You gave us a laundry list earlier and what sort of magnitude might that be? Bill Rogers : Yes. We'll start talking about that in the next couple of quarters, Mike, and how they fit into the overall structure. As I've said to you before, I mean we have -- every business unit has a positive operating leverage plan. I mean that's what we've asked them to do is to create plans that are unique to their businesses, but what we need to do in addition is that sort of the enterprise positive operating leverage focus. 2024, we'll just have to see how it plays out. I mean there's a lot of economic factors that will determine that. So I'd say, not throwing in the towel, so to speak, but we just have to see where some of the economics layout as it relates to that. So if we're in a different rate environment, we're in a different investment banking environment, we're in a different -- then I'll have a different view on that. But as we sit here today, that's -- it's a tough climb, but what we want to do is build that capacity for the long-term. Mike Mayo : And then last short follow-up. I asked this with everybody, the NII guide is much lower for you and for others. Do you think you've captured it all here? I mean do you lead the year at that kind of fourth quarter level and that say? Or do you see more downside after that? Mike Maguire : As far as the year is concerned, look, we've flipped to this higher for longer. The new guide reflects how betas are performing. So I think we feel like we've got it for the year. As far as trajectory and trough and '24, it's just -- I think it really is going to be rate path and policy dependent, so long as we're at these rates and for longer betas are going to keep creeping. Now the good news is we are seeing -- and Bill mentioned there's some improvement on things like credit spreads and repricing assets, et cetera. But I think so long as we stay at whatever 5.25%, 5.5% or there's risk, if there's a second hike for sure, Mike, to our outlook. But no, I think we've got Q3 and Q4 pretty well pegged. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. John McDonald : Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask a little bit about credit. Could you talk a little bit about the asset quality trends you saw this quarter? What drove the increase in nonperformers, particularly around C&I and CRE? Bill Rogers : John, I'll turn it over to Clarke, but just -- there's not a trend. So a lot of idiosyncratic things, but let me turn it over to Clarke to do a little more detail. Clarke Starnes : Yes. Thanks, Bill, and thanks, John. So I would just say we had a number of moving pieces this quarter from a credit perspective and a lot of that was an intentionality around actively managing the portfolio. So the takeaways I would give you are. First, we had really solid consumer performance overall with lower NPLs and losses versus our forecast, so the consumer is holding up really well. So where we did see some of the impact, to your point, is in the C&I and CRE books. From a C&I standpoint, we did see some uptick in NPLs and losses, but what I'd tell you is it's more episodic. There's no particular trend or segment issue, as Bill said, and we're coming off really low historical numbers, and so even where we are today would be lower than our long-term numbers. But as far as the NPL increase, most of that was driven by an intentional focus on CRE office. So what we did is we did an intense loan-by-loan review of our -- almost our entire book. So I would just give you some color on Q1 and our community bank, we looked at every -- we looked at all office loans greater than $2 million and in Q2, we looked at everything over $25 million, so we've done a loan-by-loan review with the vast majority of all of our CRE office. That included updated risk assessments and view evaluation. So we work really, really hard to make sure we're not kicking the can down the road and we understand where we are. So as a result of that, we put a few loans on nonaccrual. I would tell you that the predominance of those loans are actually current . They're swapped to maturity from a rate standpoint, and they've got good economic risk. But we're trying to stay focused on their ability to exit at maturity, and so we're looking and making sure we fully understand that, so that drove the increase in NPLs. And then we did recognize that with six bp increase in our allowance. And so our office allocation is up six point overall, so we feel really good about that. So again, I would say the takeaway is worked really hard to make sure we have good visibility in the portfolio. And the good news is our overall guidance for losses really didn't change. We included our student loan impact for Q2, but we maintain otherwise, our loss guidance for the year. John McDonald : Got it. And maybe just as a follow-up, Clarke. What should we think about in terms of maybe the charge-off trajectory in the back half of the year that's embedded in the guidance relative to the 42, I guess, jumping off point here. Clarke Starnes : Yes. Again, we're very confident we'll be within the range of 40 to 50 for the entire year. And I would just remind you all that the second half of the year is always seasonally high in our Consumer businesses, particularly in our subprime auto, and so that's why you see the range stay in the 40 to 50 range, so it will be higher than Q2, but within the guidance we've given you. John McDonald : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll move to our next question from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. John Pancari : Good morning. On the efficiency side of things, I know I heard you around the efficiency program that you're working on and looking to bend the cost curve. How should we think about long-term efficiency for the company? As you're looking at this program, as you're looking at this quarter being the inflection and the -- you're apparently clearly looking at across businesses. How should we think about what the prudent, what the appropriate efficiency ratio is from a long-term perspective that you're likely to target here? Thanks. Bill Rogers : Hey, John, this is Bill. I'll take that. What I said was, obviously, is that the expense growth is going to decrease materially, so that's what we're going to see. And then the absolute expense base related to our businesses. I think the way to think about it, and this was very similar sort of how we came out of the merger is we should be sort of top quartile efficiency ratio. So the efficiency ratio is kind of be a bit determined by a little bit of the market conditions where rates are. But our business model, our construct, things that we're engaged in, I think rather than sort of honing in on a specific number because I think that's sort of boxes you in, so to speak, in terms of business mix and those type of things. I think really hone in on the expectation from shareholders ought to be that we ought to be sort of top quartile from an efficiency ratio given the opportunities that we have, both on the revenue side, and then the diversity and construct of our business mix. John Pancari : Okay. Thanks, Bill. That's helpful. And then on the credit side, I appreciate the color you just gave around the non-accruals. Can you give us your thoughts around additional reserve additions here? Is it likely that you still see some incremental build there? And then what -- where does the commercial real estate reserves stand right now, the ratio and the same for the office commercial real estate reserve? Thanks. Clarke Starnes : Hey, John. This is Clarke. While we're comfortable with our reserve levels right now based on what we know today, obviously, CECL's life of loan, given what you know today, obviously, if the economic outlook deteriorates any further or we do see additional deterioration beyond what we believe we've seen and forecasted today around the portfolio performance or risk attributes. You could see some additional incremental build, but I would not expect to see any sort of large build or hockey stick type. So I think it would be more incremental if we see some. And then as far as did say the CRE office reserve is 6.2% overall, I would remind you all, we have about 40% of our portfolio with our small loans and our wealth and CCB segments, which carries higher reserves. So we've got -- but I think are really strong reserves against where I think the fundamental risk is in the office side and then our total CRE allocation right now is 240. John Pancari : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning, Bill. Good morning, Mike. Bill Rogers : Good morning. Gerard Cassidy : Clarke, you were talking about what's going on here in commercial real estate. And can you give us some further color on when you look at the nonaccrual increase in commercial real estate? Is it because the owners of these properties are losing tenants? Is it more the value of the properties have fallen and therefore the loan to values are out of sync? And then as part of the answer, how are you guys working to resolve working with your customers to resolve these issues? Clarke Starnes : Great question, Gerard. I would say for us, we take a very strict view of accrual status when we think about whether a loan needs to be on nonaccrual or not. And I would just remind you what I said but majority of the loans that we placed on nonaccrual this quarter in the CRE office segment and C&I, but in the CRE office segment are actually currently -- current from a contractual basis right now because they still have good economic rents. They're hedged on the rate side, and so they're performing on their payments. But we're looking at what might happen at the end of term as the rate impact fully hit after the swaps go off and whether there's any risk in leasing activity and then what it costs to, for example, reposition the property from an operating standpoint or structurally to be sure the loan could be resized at maturity. And so that's what's driving our view of accrual status, so a lot of it is the valuation side unless the sponsor of principle can address these risks. The good news is we're working with our sponsors. We don't see our clients in any way just walking away from the loans. We have long-term relationships there. And so we're looking at things like asking them to refit, bring in more equity, give us an LC, bring us some interest reserves. We may do some AB note splits while as they attempt to sell the property. So we've got a lot of tools in the tool chest and we're working all of those. Our goal is to be early on this and work with as many borrowers as we can. And hopefully, the market will improve and will have good success. Bill Rogers : And then not to minimize the focus because, I mean, it's acute, but just also remember, 75% of this portfolio is sitting in our markets, so we're sort of a net in migration market. So while they're dealing with current tenants, people are consolidating their office space, all that's happening, we're experiencing that with all of our bars. We also have markets in which there's a lot of in migration, so there's also more new tenants and more opportunities. And it's idiosyncratic, you've got to be in the right building, the Class A, the opportunities and our portfolio arcs to Class A and end market migration market. So again, not to minimize it, but we got -- we have some better opportunities from that side. Mike Maguire : Very good, Bill. Gerard Cassidy : One more question, Bill. Yes. Just as a quick follow-up. Mike, when you look at the AOCI burn down, what would accelerate that in terms from an interest rate standpoint, the forward curve is looking for some short-term interest rate cuts early next year. What would bring that number down even faster from an interest rate environment standpoint, what would you have to see? Mike Maguire : Well, a couple of. I think the positive catalyst even away from rates would be, I guess, in connection with rates would be speeds increasing in terms of the actual cash flow profile. But if you're looking at the rates, we would need to see the long end rally and we'd actually need to see a parallel benefit from mortgage spreads as well. So some of the, for example, rate rally you saw even from the end of the quarter to this to where we are 20, 30 basis points on the 10-year. If mortgage spreads don't come with it, it can lag a bit. But that would be the -- and Gerard thanks for the question because what we tried to lay out on the right-hand part of that slide, frankly, was a pretty conservative burn-down analysis based on today's speeds, which are quite slow and with no benefit from yield curve normalization. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Operator : We have time for one more question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matthew O'Connor: Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just one more on costs here. I guess how are you thinking about organizing the effort in terms of who's kind of taking responsibility for running it? Are you thinking about bringing in any outside consultants to get kind of a fresh perspective? Or talk about the organization of it. Thank you. Bill Rogers : Matt, maybe at its simplest form, it's me in terms of sort of who's responsible, but our executive leadership team, and we've got a really good focus on this. We've got -- and by the way, we have different third parties helping us with different elements, so they're not an Uber approach because I actually think we need to own it. It needs to be part of the work that we do as a leadership team. But we have a variety of consultants looking on specific areas, so they may be focused on or consolidation of a specific technology or an outsourcing of a particular thing, so they exist as part of the process. But this is an overall leadership team, sleeves rolled up, everybody is in it. Not only line of business up, but most importantly, enterprise across where I think the real efficiencies are achieved and are more permanent as we think about the company. Matthew O'Connor: And in terms of how you think about the timing, is this going to be like a one year effort or several year effort, a continuous improvement effort. How are you thinking about that so far? Thanks. Bill Rogers : Yes. I mean it's already underway, and it's a continuous improvement. I mean, I think the mentality of structuring the company around our strategic focus and creating a chassis that attaches to it is not a onetime thing. I think that's something that we're constantly doing, constantly looking at again, back to that commitment to sort of be top quartile in terms of how we run the company from an efficient standpoint, so that's both the revenue and the expense part that comes along with that. So it's not a onetime big bang thing because I actually don't think those are permanent. I don't think they stick. This is a philosophy of how we run the company and the approach that we take long-term. Matthew O'Connor: Okay. Thank you. Operator : That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'll turn the floor back over for any closing remarks. Brad Milsaps : Okay. That completes our earnings call today. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team. Thank you for your interest in Truist, and we hope you have a great day. Tarren, you may now disconnect the call. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you again for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Brad Milsaps. Brad Milsaps : Thank you, Anthony, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist third quarter 2023 earnings call. With us today are our Chairman and CEO, Bill Rogers; and our CFO, Mike Maguire. During this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's third quarter results, share their perspectives on current business conditions and provide an updated outlook for 2023. Clarke Starnes, our Vice Chair and Chief Risk Officer; Beau Cummins, our Vice Chair; and John Howard, Truist Insurance Holdings' Chairman and CEO, are also in attendance and available to participate in the Q&A portion of our call. The accompanying presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the Truist Investor Relations website ir.truist.com. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on slides 2 and 3 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix for appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. With that, I'll turn it over to Bill. Bill Rogers : Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. Now, before we get into the third quarter results, let's begin as always with our purpose on Slide 4. As we all know, Truist is a purpose-driven company committed to inspiring and building better lives and communities. I'd like to take a few minutes just to highlight some of the ways we demonstrated our purpose last quarter. Truist is driving positive change by supporting organizations that promote the growth and vibrancy of our communities. In August, we invested $17 million to support affordable housing in Charlotte and career development and economic mobility programs across the state of North Carolina. And just last week, we announced our allocation of $65 million in new market tax credits from the U.S. Treasury's Community Development Financial Institution Fund. This is the 12th time Truist has received an award, which has allowed us to invest $750 million in underserved communities by providing loans with reduced rates of interest and/or non-traditional terms. Over the years, these loans have helped spark economic development and job growth and communities across the regions we serve. I'm really proud of the meaningful work we're doing as a company to have a positive effect on the lives of our clients, our teammates and our communities and, of course, our shareholders as we work to realize our purpose. Now, let's turn to some of the key takeaways on Slide 6. Truist reported solid third quarter earnings that met our guidance despite certain discrete non-interest income and expense items that negatively impacted our results. Mike is going to cover those later in the call. As you can see on the slide, our solid performance was defined by several underlying key themes. On our July earnings call, we discussed our intent to significantly reduce the rate of expense growth at our company, which was followed up with the introduction of our simplification efforts and $750 million cost saves program in September. We're fully committed to delivering on this work. And the reduction in third quarter expenses is evidence of the hard work that's been ongoing throughout the year. We're also managing our balance sheet more efficiently. During the past few earnings calls, I've described how we're focusing on core clients, reducing lower-yielding portfolios and paying down higher cost borrowings, all of which occurred during the third quarter and helped drive our NIM higher by four basis points during the quarter. Moreover, these efforts have increased our CET1 ratio to nearly 10%, which is a level that we believe we can maintain throughout the proposed phase-in period under pending Basel III rules based on our current rate of organic capital growth. Although asset quality is normalizing off historically low levels, we are encouraged that our metrics remained relatively stable during the quarter, while we continue to build our loan loss reserve, considering the uncertain economic environment. Lastly, we're making strong progress on our cost saves program and organizational simplification, which we'll discuss in more detail later the call. I'm pleased with our direction, the intensity, and focus and I'm confident in our ability to emerge as a stronger company. While the quarter was solid, we acknowledge there's more work to do as strive to produce better and more consistent results in the future. We view this third quarter performance as a step forward in that direction. So, let's do some more specific work on Slide 7. Net income available to common shareholders was $1.1 billion or $0.80 per share. Merger-related and restructuring charges primarily related to severance associated with our cost saves program hurt EPS by $0.04. Total revenue decreased as expected and was essentially in line with our guidance despite an $87 million discrete impact to service charges on deposits revenue. We're also encouraged that our net interest margin improved four basis points, driven by our ongoing balance sheet optimization efforts, including a reduction in FHLB borrowings, a decline in lower-yielding loan balances, and improving new and renewed loan spreads. Adjusted expenses were down 50 basis points and within our guidance range and would have decreased 250 basis points excluding $70 million of higher-than-normal other expense. Average loans decreased 2.5%, primarily due to the sale of the student loan portfolio in the second quarter and our continued repositioning towards higher-return core assets. Average deposits increased modestly as we continue to experience a remixing towards higher-yielding alternatives. We added 29 basis points of CET1 capital in the quarter and increased our ALLL ratio by six basis points in light of ongoing economic uncertainty. Lastly, we maintained our strong quarterly common stock dividend at $0.52 per share paid on September 1st. So, let's move to our digital update on Slide 8. Digital engagement trends at Truist remain positive, as you can see on the left side of the slide. Mobile app users have grown steadily over the past year, and we're currently focused on driving additional growth through our MobileFirst engagement initiative. From an activity standpoint, digital transactions increased 9% relative to the fourth quarter last year, driven primarily by Zelle transactions, which were up 32% over the same period. Due to the rapid growth we've experienced, Digital has quickly become a preferred channel for interacting with Truist. In fact, digital transactions now account for more than 60% of total bank transactions. And while that's certainly positive, Truist has a meaningful opportunity to shift the transaction mix even more towards digital, specifically by leveraging what we call T3, which is this concept that touch and technology work together to create trust, and that further enhances the client experience and drives greater digital adoption and efficiency. As a proof point, recent enhancements to the digital onboarding have helped drive a 19% increase in Truist One funding rates year-to-date, which may in turn lead to additional balances and transaction activity with those new clients. In sum, Truist has solid momentum in digital and I'm highly optimistic about the potential we have to leverage T3 to further expand our digital user base and drive transaction volume. Next, I'm going to cover loans and leases on Slide 9. Average loans decreased 2.5% sequentially, reflecting our ongoing balance sheet optimization efforts, including the sale of our student loan portfolio last quarter and further reductions in lower return portfolios. Excluding the student loan sale, average loans were down 1.1%. Average commercial loans decreased 1.1% primarily due to a 1.5% decrease in C&I balances driven by lower revolver utilization and production. Lower C&I production in our corporate and commercial banking segment reflected a combination of moderately lower demand due to economic uncertainty and greater pricing discipline which contributed to wider spreads on new production and commercial community bank. In our consumer and credit card portfolios, average loans decreased 4.6%, primarily due to the sale of our student loan portfolio and further reductions in indirect auto production. Consumer and card balances were down 1%, excluding the student loan sale. Residential mortgage was essentially flat relative to the prior quarter. We do continue to experience growth in higher yielding portfolios, especially Sheffield in Service Finance. Loan production increased 21% year-over-year at Sheffield and 17% at Service Finance. Overall, we expect average commercial and consumer balances to decline modestly in the fourth quarter, driven by our ongoing mixed shift towards deeper client penetrations, deeper relationships, the emphasis of lower return portfolios and the effects of continued economic uncertainty. Let's move to the deposit trends on Slide 10. Average deposits were flat sequentially, although we continued to experience remixing within the portfolio, as clients saw higher rate alternatives. Noninterest bearing deposits decreased 3.9% and currently represent 30% of total deposits compared to 31% in the second quarter and 34% in the fourth quarter of last year. Within our segments, average deposits were down 1% in corporate and commercial banking and relatively flat in consumer banking and wealth due to the effects of quantitative tightening and availability of higher rate alternatives. We continue to deepen our relationships with Consumer Banking and Wealth Clients, especially in payments. Net new checking account production has been positive for three quarters in a row. We're also seeing solid adoption of our flagship Truist One checking product. In addition, small business deposits were up sequentially, and August was the strongest month for net new small business checking account production in the last three years. Deposit costs continue to rise during the third quarter, though at a slower pace. Interest-bearing deposit cost increased 38 basis points sequentially, down from a 55 basis point increase in the prior quarter. Our interest-bearing cumulative deposit beta was 49%, up from 44% in the second quarter due to the presence of higher rate alternatives and ongoing mixed shift from noninterest-bearing accounts into higher yielding products. Going forward, we'll continue to maintain our balanced approach, being attentive to our client needs and relationships while also striving to maximize value for them outside of rate paid. Now, let me turn it over to Mike to discuss the financial results in a little more detail. Mike? Mike Maguire : Great. Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to begin with net interest income on Slide 11. For the quarter, taxable equivalent, net interest income decreased 1.6% linked quarter primarily due to lower average earning assets and higher deposit costs. Although net interest income was down linked quarter, we are encouraged that the decline was slower than the 6.1% decrease observed in the second quarter as deposit betas increased at a more moderate pace. Reported net interest margin increased 4 basis points after declining for two consecutive quarters. NIM stabilization reflected our ongoing balance sheet optimization initiatives, including: focusing on our core clients, improving spreads on new and renewed loans, reducing lower-yielding loan portfolios and paying down higher cost wholesale borrowings, including FHLB advances, which were down about $20 billion on average compared to the second quarter. Turning to non-interest income on Slide 12. Fee income decreased $185 million or 8.1% relative to the second quarter. The decline was primarily attributable to lower insurance income, which decreased $142 million sequentially due to seasonality. Insurance production is typically lowest in the third quarter and highest in the second. Insurance fundamentals remain strong, driven by new business growth, improved retention and favorable pricing, all of which contributed to 6.3% organic revenue growth on a like-quarter basis. Service charges on deposits were down $88 million in the third quarter due primarily to $87 million of client refund accruals that were driven by changes we made to our deposit fee protocols. Investment banking and trading income was lower by $26 million, while other income increased $38 million primarily due to higher income from other investments. Fee income was flat on a like-quarter basis as higher insurance income and higher other income were offset by lower service charges and lower investment banking and trading income. Next, I'll cover non-interest expense on Slide 13. Reported non-interest expense was flat sequentially as lower adjusted expense was offset by a $21 million increase in merger-related and restructuring expense, driven mostly by severance and facilities rationalization. Adjusted non-interest expense decreased 50 basis points sequentially, in line with our July guidance range of flat to down 1%. The decrease in adjusted expenses was driven by lower personnel expense and reduced professional fees and outside processing expense, partially offset by higher other expense. The increase in other expense included $70 million of costs arising from the previously mentioned client deposit service charge refund accruals as well the settlement of certain litigation matters, including a settlement and patent licensing agreement, which resolved the USAA patent infringement lawsuit. If you excluded these items, adjusted expenses declined by 2.5% linked quarter. The work associated with our gross cost saves program is well underway as we will discuss on Slide 14. In September, we announced a $750 million gross cost saves plan that will be achieved over the next 12 to 18 months. The cost saves will include $300 million from reductions in force, $250 million from organizational realignment and simplification and $200 million from technology expense reductions. Since these initiatives were announced in mid-September, we have already realigned significant elements of our organizational and operational structure to improve efficiency and to drive revenue opportunities. The work we're doing includes optimizing spans and layers to improve organizational design health, consolidating redundant functions, restructuring select businesses and geographic simplification, all of which will result in reductions force over the next couple of quarters. In addition, we are aggressively managing third-party spend, reducing our corporate real estate footprint and rationalizing technology spend. Based on the latest information available, we still expect one-time costs associated with the cost saves program to range from 25% to 30% of gross cost saves. We also continue to project the cost saves program will help us manage adjusted expense growth to 0% to 1% in 2024, which is net of natural expense growth driven by inflation and other factors. Moving to asset quality on Slide 15. Asset quality metrics continued to normalize in the third quarter, but overall remain manageable. Non-performing assets were unchanged linked-quarter, while early-stage delinquencies increased four basis points sequentially as increases in our consumer portfolios were partially offset by declines in commercial. Included in our appendix is updated data on our office portfolio, which represents 1.7% of total loans. We're pleased that non-performing and criticized and classified office loans increased only modestly linked-quarter, while we increased the reserve on this portfolio from 6.2% at June 30, up to 8.3% at September 30. Our net charge-off ratio decreased 3 basis points to 51 basis points, reflecting the prior quarter impact of the student loan sale, partially offset by increases in our CRE and consumer lending portfolios. [Total] reserves as provision expense exceeded net charge-offs by $92 million. Our ALLL ratio increased to 1.49%, up 6 basis points sequentially and 15 basis points year-over-year due to ongoing credit normalization and greater economic uncertainty. Consistent with our commentary last quarter, we have tightened our risk appetite in select areas, though we maintain our through-the-cycle supportive approach for high-quality, long-term clients. Turning to capital now on Slide 16. Based on our assessment of the proposed capital rules, we feel confident in our ability to meet the requirements under the proposed phase-in periods. Truist added 29 basis points of CET1 capital in the third quarter through a combination of organic capital generation and disciplined RWA management. With a CET1 ratio of 9.9%, Truist remains well capitalized relative to our new minimum regulatory requirement of 7.4%, which took place on October 1. As a company, we are strongly committed to building capital and achieving a CET1 ratio of approximately 10% by the end the year. The projected trajectory for our CET1 ratio does incorporate headwinds from the pending FDIC assessment, which is now expected to be recognized in the fourth quarter. Our primary capital priorities are supporting the organic growth needs of new and existing core clients and the payment of our $0.52 per share common dividend. We have no plans to repurchase shares over the near-term and we will continue to allow previous acquisitions to mature. RWA management continues to be disciplined as we allocate less capital to certain businesses, though we have been very clear that our balance sheet is open to core clients. In addition, we continue to believe that Truist's capital flexibility with Truist Insurance Holdings is a distinctive advantage. We estimate that our residual 80% ownership stake provides greater than 200 basis points of additional capital flexibility. The table in the center of the slide provides an updated analysis of our AOCI. Based on estimated cash flows in today's forward curve, we would expect the component of AOCI attributable to securities decline from $13.5 billion at the end of the third quarter to $9.7 billion by the end of 2026 or a decline of 28%. Finally, as it relates to the proposed rules for a long-term debt requirement, we estimate that Truist's binding constraint is at the bank level and that the shortfall is approximately $13 billion. We are confident that we will meet the proposed requirements at both the bank and holding company level through normal debt issuance during the phase-in period. Now, I will review our updated guidance on Slide 17. Looking into the fourth quarter of 2023, we expect revenues to be flat or to decline 1% from 3Q 2023 GAAP revenue of $5.7 billion. We expect linked-quarter improvement in non-interest income due to higher insurance, service charges on deposit income, and investment banking and trading income, partially offset by lower mortgage and other income. Net interest income is likely to remain under some pressure due to our smaller balance sheet and modest NIM compression. Adjusted expenses of $3.5 billion are expected to decline 3.5% due to lower personnel and other expenses. In April, we stated that our 2023 expense guidance excluded expenses associated with TIH independence readiness. Previously, we've not called out these costs because they totaled only $20 million through the first nine months of 2023, including $9 million in the second quarter and $11 million in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we expect these expenses to approximate $35 million, which are excluded from our 4Q 2023 expense guidance. For the full year 2023, we expect revenues to increase by approximately 1.5%, which is at the midpoint of our previous revenue guidance of up 1% to 2%. Our guidance includes the $87 million client refund accrual that negatively impacted fees in the third quarter. Full year 2023 adjusted expenses are still on track to increase 7%. This includes $70 million related to the legal settlements and client deposit service charge refunds, but excludes the $55 million of TIH Independence readiness costs for 2023. In terms of asset quality, we have tightened our guidance from a range of 40 to 50 basis points to approximately 50 basis points for the full year, which includes the impact of the student loan sale. Finally, we expect our tax rate tax rate - effective to approximate 18% or 20% on a taxable equivalent basis compared to 19% and 21% previously. Now, I'll hand it back to Bill for some final remarks. Bill Rogers : Great. Thanks Mike. And I'll conclude on Slide 18. So looking beyond the third quarter, our transformation into a simpler, more profitable company is underway. We're driving swift and meaningful actions to simplify our organization, which include key organizational changes. So, for example, in the recent weeks we've streamlined our commercial and community banking regions from 21 to 14, realigned several overlapping units into a unified commercial real estate business. We merged our consumer payments and wholesale payments businesses into a single Enterprise Payments organization, which will help us to accelerate payments activity more effectively across Truist. There have been a number of team consolidations within our consumer and small business banking lines of businesses. We've also realigned nine teams under our enterprise operational services to drive efficiencies across our support team serving the whole organization. All of these changes are part of our $750 million cost saves program, which is well underway and designed to drive better service for our clients and limit adjusted expense growth to flat up 1% in 2024. Although we're focused on reducing the rate of expense growth, we will continue to invest in our risk management organization and ability to maintain strong asset quality metrics. While there are many changes happening inside Truist, we've not lost focus on our core consumer and commercial businesses, which is an area that will continue to see significant investment. Net new checking account production has been positive for the first three quarters of this year, and we're on track to continue positive net news for the whole year. During the quarter, we acquired more than 39,000 households through our digital channel. We're also maintaining momentum in wealth, where net organic asset flows have been positive in nine of the past 10 quarters. Client satisfaction scores were stable or increased across most RSPB channels during the third quarter. In the corporate and commercial, new left lead transactions were up 45% year-over-year. Lastly, our wholesale payments pipeline is up 10% year-over-year. We're also seeing strong improvement in client sentiment amongst commercial clients, reflecting product and digital investments that we've already made. As a company, we're also operating our balance sheet more efficiently, thanks to our focus on core clients, deemphasizing lower-return portfolios and paying down higher cost debt. We're building capital, and we feel confident in our ability to satisfy the requirements proposed in the Basel III Endgame rules with the proposed phase-in periods, while preserving our strategic flexibility with TIH. In conclusion, we're making progress and we're doing what's necessary to improve our financial performance to meet your high expectations and, of course, ours. I am truly optimistic about Truist, and I know we're well-positioned for the future. Our teammates are really performing at a high level, and they are committed to serving our clients, caring for each other and capitalizing on our great growth markets, I am really proud of our teammates. Before we move to Q&A, I also want to publicly thank the eight members of our Board of Directors who plan to retire at the end of this year. I'm deeply grateful for their years of service and meaningful contributions to our company. Truist literally exists due to their leadership and confidence. Following these retirements, our Board will consist of 13 members, including 12 Independent Directors who are well-positioned to oversee and advance our strategic plans during this period of rapid industry transformation. So with that, Brad, let me turn it back over to you, and we look forward to the Q&A. Brad Milsaps : Thank you, Bill. Anthony, at this time, will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session As you do that, I\u2019d like to ask participants to please limit yourselves to one primary question and one follow-up in order that we may accommodate as many of you as possible in the call today. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. You may now go ahead. Ken Usdin : Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for the color and update. I just \u2013 Bill, just coming back to the independence preparation for TIH and articles that were in the paper, I know you're still, I'm talking about the optionality. Can you just give us an updated sense of just how you're looking at the value of the business financially versus strategically? And what would change here to make you guys move forward with some type of transaction to move it forward? Bill Rogers : Yes, Ken, good morning and thanks for that. As you can imagine, I don't want to comment on any rumor or speculation. But to your question, think about the reason we did the opportunity with standpoint. I mean what we wanted to do is exactly what you highlighted in your question is to create this financial and strategic flexibility for both Truist for TIH. We wanted to establish value in the business, and the business is growing. I mean, we've been able to hire and retain talent. So we feel really good about what's happening in the core insurance business. We wanted to make sure that the insurance business had flexibility to continue to grow and then that Truist has an opportunity to respond so whatever may happen. I mean, we're obviously in a market that's got lot of uncertainty to it, and we just want to retain that strategic and financial flexibility. So there's not one thing. There's not like a queue. If something happens, we do this, But we want to just continue to reserve this flexibility and continue to apply it to both the bank and the insurance business. Ken Usdin : Yes. And I guess just a follow-up on it as well. Like at what point does financial benefit become strategic? Because a lot of the questions we get are the trade-off between the two. An obvious ability to improve capital versus a delta in terms of like fee contribution, ROE, et cetera. So it's hard for the investor community to kind of just understand what that incremental switch is. I guess, maybe, how do you think about that notion of like when financial becomes strategic? Bill Rogers : Yes. As I said, there isn't a particular trigger point. We just want to make sure that we retain that flexibility and we're constantly looking at everything that you just talked about and factoring that into the decision-making. This is something that we sort of continually keep in front of ourselves, we keep in front of the Board. But I think the intentionality - I mean, reason we did this is we're allowed to have this conversation around flexibility. Ken Usdin : Right. Okay. Thank you, Bill. Bill Rogers : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. You may now go ahead. John McDonald : Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask you about net interest income. A number of banks have said that they see NII dollars potentially bottoming in the fourth quarter. Mike mentioned you see a little bit of slippage into the fourth quarter. But do you have any visibility on whether that could stabilize fourth quarter? And what factors should we think about for you as we think about the NII path heading into next year? Mike Maguire : Yes, good morning, John. We obviously did see some pressure this quarter, actually probably a little bit better than we expected and that we talked about during the second quarter. We do expect to continue to see some pressure in the fourth, and frankly, even into the first half of 2024. And I think that just has to do with the rate path. We have an expectation that we think we've seen our last hike, and we don't have a cut in forecast until July of next year. We have two cuts in the second half. And so as betas - sort of, again, the good news is, are slowing down, and we feel like grinding a bit lower, we should still feel a little bit of pressure there. We're trying to combat some of that pressure. We've been very intentional around how we're managing rate paid across our client base. We're beginning to see some nice progress as it relates to new and renewed credit spreads. We're repricing some of the fixed rate loans. So the good news is, is while there's pressure, it's moderating, but we still do see that pressure into early next year. John McDonald : Got you. Thank, Mike. And in terms of the expenses, when you talk about the goal for next year to be flat to up 1%, can you remind us how much of the $750 million gross are you expecting it next year and whether you might also have TIH readiness costs go into next year, too. Mike Maguire : Yes. I can start there, John. I think Bill may want to weigh in, too. Hard to say. I mean, we said on the 750. It's kind of 12 to 18 months. I mean, I think if you think about two-thirds plus or minus being recognized next year, maybe it's a little more than that. That's how we're thinking about the math there. And that would again, John, give us the confidence that we have to make sure we manage expense growth to less than 1%. You asked about TIH readiness costs as well. We're not ready to talk about 2024 yet there. We will give you more visibility to that when we guide for the full year in January. John McDonald : Okay. Fair enough. Thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. You may now go ahead. Ebrahim Poonawala : Thank you. Good morning. Mike Maguire : Good morning. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess maybe Mike, just following up on the expense savings, one, just like to think through when we look at the 0% to 1% growth next year, when do these get realized and should we assume that the expense run rate through 2024 continues to decline? So when we are thinking about exit 2024, second half 2024, expenses will be lower than first half 2024, is that just from a construct standpoint the right way to think about how these flows through relative to your offsetting investments? Mike Maguire : Yes. Ebrahim, I think the way I'd answer that question is, a lot of the action we're taking, actually right now and in the rest of the fourth quarter and early next year around, for example, some of the organizational design and health and some of the reductions in force, you'll see that come into the run rate relatively quickly. Same goes for some of the realignment of businesses. Those have different flavors. In certain cases, if we significantly restructure a business, like as a good example, we discontinued our middle market agency trading business earlier this year. That was a pretty quick adjustment to run rate. Other adjustments we're making maybe take place throughout the course of next year. And then technology spend, which as you recall is a pretty significant component of our cost savings plan. That has a variety of flavors as well. So I'd say for the most part, you're going to see pretty good progress on run rate adjustment sort of as we exit 2023 and enter 2024. And you'll see, I think, just sort of continuous improvement throughout the course of the year. Ebrahim Poonawala : That's helpful. Thanks, Mike. And I guess this is a separate question. So, you talked about exiting certain businesses, a student loan portfolio, another one. How much more is there as you think about just making the balance sheet more efficient, optimizing capital? Is there a lot more to go on the asset side that you could look to exit or sale? And if there's any way to quantify that? Mike Maguire : I think we got after the lowest hanging fruit pretty quickly. Ebrahim, the student portfolio was not a strategic asset for us. It was less profitable. There have been other businesses within even our C&I business, for example, that we didn't feel like we're as highly as strategic. We've talked a lot about correspondent mortgage and some of our national indirect lending businesses. So, I think that we have a pretty good line of sight to it. I think going forward, it's just much more around optimization, right? And being more disciplined in how we select opportunities, how we price opportunities. We're seeing that come through in our results as well. But there's not, I don't think a significant shoe to drop on portfolio sales and those types of things. Bill Rogers : Maybe the only thing to add to that, Mike, is just particularly in the areas that we've seen really good growth like Sheffield and Service Finance, we'll do more securitization. So, we'll create more velocity around those things on our balance sheet, which I think are great. So, continue the production, continue to acquire new clients but increase velocity. And we'll look at that with other parts of our portfolio. So, I think Mike said it right, I mean it's not a major power shift. But this optimization strategy, our team has really embraced, and I think we just continue to have more opportunities, I'm going to say, around the edges but maybe more significant that as we move forward. And you saw that reflected in the NIM this quarter. Ebrahim Poonawala : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you both. Operator : Our next question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS. You may now go ahead. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Bill Rogers : Good morning. Erika Najarian : This first question is for you, Bill. I think just taking a step back and thinking about Slide 16, I think a handful of your investors did think that once you struck the deal with Stone Point, that it was a sort of one-way exit. That being said, that deal was struck in February, right? The world didn't change in until March. And so my question for you is that you have this monetization opportunity for Truist Insurance Holdings. And as you think about the proceeds, again, clearly, the world has changed. So, how do you balance essentially the push that some investors are calling for in terms of restructuring your portfolio very meaningfully? And I can see in that in that middle chart Slide 16 that portfolio is a very, very slow lead versus if you do that, you're essentially making the same call you did in 4Q 2020, which is assume that rates are going to stay where they are versus maybe doing more on the RWA mitigation side, which will cost you more in NII over the near-term, but won't trap you into making a rate bet. Bill Rogers : Erika, I think you've been in all our meetings. These are all the things that we're evaluating. Everything is in a bucket to discuss. And as you noted, I mean, the world changed pretty substantially from March. But it just reaffirmed our desire to have this flexibility. And going back a little bit to the independents question, remember, we sort of got this large capital benefit. But we always have this - part of getting that benefit was the expense of creating the independents over the long term, as you just highlighted that. So, that - to us, that was always a really good trade-off in terms of creating that flexibility. So, I don't want to speculate today as to we're going to go left or we're going to go right, other than to say, I think you've encapsulated almost perfectly in your question all the alternatives we would consider and their trade-offs to every single one. There's not one perfect path, there are trade-offs to all of them. And we're going to make the decisions that are in best long-term interest of our shareholders. That's going to be our North Star and the guiding post as we think through this and factor in all the environment that we exist today, and that will exist tomorrow with everything that you put into your question. Erika Najarian : Thank you. And my second question is far more boring. On the service charges, Mike, it went down to 150 from like a 240 handle and 249 in the previous quarter - previous March quarter. Was that a onetime reversal? Or is this a new run rate? I know that there was some offset in other income, but just trying to think about the moving pieces for fees from here? Mike Maguire : Yes. During the quarter, the accrual that we referenced was $87 million, and that's not something that we would expect to continue. Erika Najarian : Thank you. Mike Maguire : Yes. Operator : Our next question will come from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. You may now go ahead. John Pancari : Morning. Mike Maguire : Morning, John. John Pancari : On the commentary you gave to John McDonald's question regarding some incremental pressure and margin in NII in fourth quarter and into the first half, can you maybe help quantify that magnitude of the pressure that you would expect based upon your rate outlook and the balance sheet dynamics? And then secondly, could you possibly unpack the deposit growth assumption and deposit beta assumption that's baked into that? Thanks. Mike Maguire : John, I'll just maybe give you a sense for the outlook on NIM for the fourth quarter. I think we're - again, as I mentioned, with the deposit betas, creeping, we're at 49%. As you know, as of the third quarter, we were at 44 in the second. We would expect that to continue to worsen a bit. Just as customers continue to reprice a bit, that's obviously slowing. And for the most part, across three or four of our segments is sort of all the way where we think terminal betas might be, but we're still seeing some movement on the consumer side of things. So, I think a little bit of pressure from the betas, again, offset perhaps a bit by some of the credit spread widening that we're seeing. So from a NIM perspective, maybe it's a few basis points. As far as our revenue outlook for the quarter, we have a sense that it's probably worse, 1%, perhaps flat. NII is going to be down a touch and fees will be up a touch. So I'd just sort of maybe leave it at that. As far as the balance sheet sizing, we had a much more significant decline in earning assets during the third quarter, around $18 billion, we would expect that to be much, much smaller in the fourth quarter, so maybe closer to the tune of $5 billion or so. You've got the securities portfolio that's cash flowing at about $3 billion and maybe just a little bit of pressure on loans. So, I think that's probably the math you need. John Pancari : Okay. Great. Thank you. That's helpful. And then secondly, you had a pretty solid remix of the funding base that you discussed a bit on Slide 11, in third quarter, given the, some of the pay down or reduction in the club advances, et cetera. How much more do you think of rationalization of the funding mix do you think there is, in coming quarters as you look at the setup now? Thanks. Mike Maguire : Yes. I think the third quarter was unique in the amount of remixing that was accomplished. I mean, you saw the student loan portfolio was a big component of that. And that's a pretty low net interest margin contributor. Same thing, the investment portfolio at $3 billion. We took cash down by close to $5 billion. So if you think about that stuff as sort of right at SOFR, really, really thin spreads, and then at the same time taking off the FHLB advances. That was really the driver, that mixing that saw some of the benefit on the NIM and that sort of aided the NII in the quarter. I think in the fourth quarter you're going to see a more sort of traditional March of again I've hit it deposit costs creeping up a little bit higher. Hopefully, again will continue to be successful as we have been around. Thinking about rate paid, I mean, I'm really pleased by how the businesses has been performing. I mean, we've been testing different rate strategies. We've been looking at promo rates. We've looked at exception-based pricing and structure and so that will continue. And so we're going to try to do the best we can to manage that. But I think the mix driver that we saw in Q3 is really a Q3-only opportunity. John Pancari : Got it. All right. thanks Mike. Operator : Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Fargo Securities. You may now go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. I hear you about the expense guide for next year is 0% to 1%. So, that would be better, and I hear you about taking the tough actions. But then I look at the core efficiency ratio of around 60%, and it's not what investors signed up for when you announced the merger, even recognizing the rate headwinds and other things. I don't think it's where you wanted to be. So, as you embark on what maybe you could call Truist 2.0 as compared to Truist 1.0, how is management changing in terms of the time to make decisions? Truist 1.0 was like selecting best of breed, it seemed to take a long time. Maybe that was slowed down by such a large board, which now is getting reduced. How is Truist 2.0 better on intensity? How is Truist 2.0 better in terms of moving shareholders up the pecking order? And I guess, generally, with all your optimism, Bill, that certainly is not reflected in the share price, and there's a lot of frustrated and disgruntled shareholders out there. So, how can Truist is 2.0 with the $750 million of savings, maybe strategic actions with insurance, intensity and the way you manage, help shareholders more? Bill Rogers : Yes. Mike, thanks. The intensity is - I don't know what superlative to use other than high. So, the intensity is really good. And what's happened with the cost save program, and we talk about the $750 million in cost saves, but I don't want to diminish the simplification of our business. So, creating these consumer and wholesale towers and creating the simplification of our business, that really has allowed us to move a lot faster. So, I've been really pleased with how the team has embraced this whole process. I mean, leaders are stepping up in really demonstrable ways, getting in front of it and they're making decisions at a much, much faster pace. So, I outlined a bunch of the different consolidation and those type of things. Those would have been more sequential in the past. You sort of do one, you another one, you sort of go through the process. And today, they're all on these great parallel paths. And I think that's going to have a faster, longer-term impact. And look, I mean, to your point, I mean, we're not happy with where the efficiency is now. One of them stated that as publicly possible and we have demonstrable plans. We talked about the overall play on the cost saves. But long-term, that also has to result in better revenue growth. And all the things that we do together of bringing these businesses together, optimizing the balance sheet, creating capacity, creating product and capability, training our teammates, having them lean in, demonstrated net new, all the things that are building in terms of the momentum, those are key. And I can assure you, for our Board, we have presented an improvement plan on the efficiency ratio, long-term improvement plan. And we'll be on that track. I mean, we share your frustration, trust me. But I think we've got now the structure in place, the leadership in place, the commitment, the intensity, support and we're moving fast. And our team can feel it and they've embraced it. Mike Mayo : Just as a follow-up, since you did present a plan to the Board for the efficiency ratio, I don't think consensus expects much improvement next year. I guess next year is going to be tough to have positive operating leverage. But if you could comment on that. And maybe just a little bit more meat on the bones. You gave a lot, one-third less bank region, one payment business. Any other color you can give on the efficiency. And when you say simplification, I mean, you guys aren't Citigroup, right? It's not like you're in 100 countries. You're in adjacent regional markets where you should be able to be a lot more simple than what happened after the merger. So positive optimal leverage, improvement in efficiency next year, is this really, as you say, a long-term plan? Bill Rogers : Yes. On the - they're just as with efficiency, there is a positive operating leverage long-term plan in all of our businesses. And part of the simplification allows them to control that destiny and make decisions about that on a faster basis. It will be harder in the first part of next year. I mean, as you know, I mean, you're sort of running off an NII comparison. So that's just the tougher hurdle. But as we get into the latter part of next year, I mean, we're going to see continuous improvement and commitment to that on a long-term basis. So I can't - without sort of a rate forecast and all that, particularly, I can't comment exactly. But I can comment that during the second half of that, of next year, you're going to start seeing a lot of improvement on the operating leverage and going into 2025, we'll be firmly committed and be a really good flight path. And then as you - and then to the simplification things, we'll continue to - it's a really good question. We'll continue to outline some of those. I mean just think about, for example, care centers. I mean, we have a lot of care centers serving a lot of different businesses. In the merger. We needed to bring those all over the transom and have them perform well. We've invested in a lot of technology and we can consolidate care centers. Just think about that as one of dozens and dozens of examples of this component of simplification. So while I agree with you, we're not sort globally in 100 countries or whatever that parallel may have been, but we still have a lot of opportunity to make this company simpler, faster, leaner and more responsive to clients and as you noted, more responsive to shareholders. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. You may now go ahead. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. Can you guys elaborate on the service charge issue? Was that that something was kind of self-identified? Was it driven by the CFPB? Or - we haven't seen that at peers, least not yet. Can you elaborate what happened there, please? Bill Rogers : Yes, Matt. This is Bill. Yes. We did that on our own volition. I mean, we've looked at all of our products and offerings. We've listened to a lot of client feedback. We reviewed and changed our protocols with respect to deposit-related fees. And that resulted in refunds that did impact revenue and other expense. I think we're taking just a more contemporary view of sort of where the world is, where the puck is going and making sure that we get ahead that, we're staying in front and creating this clearer path as possible for next year and the continuous improvement we want to make in our business. Matt O'Connor: And then how do we think about the run rate of the service charges given these changes? Obviously, we're not going to run rate to $152 million. But I guess would assume it's lower than previous quarters if you implemented changes going forward? Mike Maguire : Yes. Look, I mean, I think there's been pressure on this item in general, just given the evolution of the service charges on deposits. But I think you can safely assume that the $87 million that we've noted here during the third quarter was a quarter event. So, again, I think you should expect there to be the same style of pressure you've seen on this line item sort of trending in the industry and for Truist, but this particular event wasn't sort of a step functional driver. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then just to summarize, I guess, at this point, with the changes that you made and the refunds like how would you frame your approach to service charges? Are you kind of in in the middle terms of being conservative or more on the conservative side? How would you frame the overdraft and the fees overall, approach? Bill Rogers : Yes, I think we've got a great product in Truist One and that really reflects where we're going. And so we're adding almost all of our new clients to Truist One. I highlighted some of the benefits, some of the things we're doing that. And then migrating some of our back book to Truist One. So, I don't know how to characterize conservative work, but I do know this is purposeful. And I think we've got an incredibly competitive product that has all the right mixes and that it's really, really client responsive, but it's also contributed to our growth. So, while service charges as an overall, as Mike talked, will continue to click down, we're balancing that with growth, adding new clients, expanding relationships. And I think that's sort of the right mix as we think going forward. Those things won't align perfectly quarter-to-quarter. But long-term, I think we're on a really, really good long-term shareholder value building path. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you. Bill Rogers : Thanks Matt. Operator : Our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. You may now go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning Bill. Good morning Mike. Bill Rogers : Hi Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Bill, can you share with us - when you think about the game plan that you and your peers have had to use post financial crisis in this low interest rate environment, of 0 to 25 basis points, there was a blip in 2018, of course. But now we're in this new rate environment that was really pre-financial crisis, what changes are you - if you are having some changes, what changes are you implementing to win new business in this new rate environment since it's quite a bit different than it was three or four years ago with both commercial and consumer customers, loans, deposits, et cetera? Bill Rogers : Yes, Gerard. I'm unfortunately maybe of the age to have operated in this environment in the past. Gerard Cassidy : Same here. Bill Rogers : Yes, exactly. So, I have some familiarity. This is not unprecedented or new territory. And I think sort of a couple of things. It first starts with - and you highlighted, I mean, the cost of funding is not free. So, the first part starts with all the things we've been talking about, about optimization and demanding more full relationships from our clients and all the things that go along with that. But you have to offer competitive products and capabilities and be leading. And so for us, I highlighted a lot of the metrics, things like net new on consumer side. So we've got a product like Truist One that's really responsive. We're winning the battle with the competitive environment that clients want more than rate paid. You've got - your paid is not the only option. You got to offer more product and more capabilities. So I think we're winning on that front. And then on the commercial and corporate side same thing. We're in the advice business. And if we start that we're in the advice business versus we're in the rate business, we start with a really good framework. So this whole concept of business life cycle, advisory where we are. I highlighted the fact that we're winning on left lead relationships, so we're becoming more important to our clients. We're becoming the go-to with our clients. We're in the first call perspective where you want to be. So I think the changes are just this relevance is so much more important to start with the market share that we enjoy in our core markets, 20%, all the ubiquity and efficiency that comes with that. So this is not new work, but it's a double down on you have to be really good at the job. You have to be really good at advice. You have to really be good in product and capability and the - which, by the way, I think that's going to really work well for Truist. The new definition of winning, I think, fits perfectly into our strategy going forward. Gerard Cassidy : I appreciate those insights, Bill. And then on credit, maybe this is best answered by Clarke. You guys talked about tightening up, I think, the credit standards a bit. But I'm more interested - we're not worried about you folks. You guys have a good track record of credit underwriting. But can you make any comments about what others might have been doing over the last two or three years, whether it's non-depositories or depositories in lending, and those may be aggressive actions, if there were any? How that could impact your customers? Who - again, you've underwritten fine but maybe they've done something crazy with somebody else, which then the second derivative, you guys get impacted. But Clarke, any color on that, especially compared to prior cycles? Clarke Starnes : Yes. Gerard, it's a great question. I know we've - my peers and I have talked about this. But I'd say, in general, particularly since the Great Recession, I think the discipline in the industry overall has been really good. And I think the fundamental credit approach despite the low rate environment, I think the industry in general is in a much better place than we were pre-financial crisis, and even the non-bank players generally have done a good job there. So I don't think there's - we don't necessarily see a big shoe to drop. I think the biggest impact we're trying to evaluate through as you shift from a long secular low rate environment to where we are now is, how economic some of those deals were even if you thought your underwriting well, how sustainable will all that be. And we feel really good about where we are. And I'd say generally, the industry as well. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Operator : We will now take our final question from Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley. You may now go ahead. Ryan Kenny : Hi. Good morning. So I just want to clarify something on the earlier questions on the NII path. So we heard the comment around not expecting any significant loan portfolio sales from here. But can you give us an update on your current approach to managing the securities portfolio? And specifically, what are your views on potentially repositioning parts of the securities portfolio, especially if more capital is freed up from potential future exits or optionality? Mike Maguire : Yes. Good morning, Ryan, on the security side, we've - on average, we see $2.5 billion to $3 billion of just cash flow and maturities from the portfolio. I think you should expect that to continue in terms of sort of just some of the drag on the earning asset base. As far as the repositioning, I don't think there's any new news here. I mean, obviously, long rates of sort of been on the rise here. And so we've been tracking the unrealized losses, and we have some incremental disclosure kind of on our current position and the burn down on our capital slide. I think we're constantly evaluating potential strategies and the likes as it relates to the bond portfolio, but nothing new. We did - I'd just say, as we think about this new world we're living in, where these unrealized losses, at least the securities AOCI is a factor in terms of capital, in an effort to manage that potential volatility in the future, we did add some pay-fixed hedges during the third quarter, which we'll see some benefit from to the extent that kind of rates hang where they are or worsen a bit. So we've got about one-third - a little less than one-third of the AFS securities hedged. Ryan Kenny : Thanks. And then just as a follow-up, on the credit side. Just give a little bit more color on what you're seeing in terms of credit quality. And I'm asking because it does look like you've increased your 2023 NCO guide slightly to the higher end of the prior range. Just wondering if you can share what you're seeing under the surface. Mike Maguire : Yes, Ryan, it's a good question. First, I'd say we haven't established our 2024 guidance yet, but I believe the things that will drive where we go forward are the same considerations we are seeing now coming out of Q3 and going into Q4. And so I would say for us, we are seeing normalization in our consumer area, particularly in the low-end consumer. So think of our regional acceptance, subprime auto. And then you've also got some defined seasonality in the second half of the year that's impacting Q4 outlook. The other piece would be on what Bill spoke of earlier and Mike, we're remixing our balance sheet to be more optimal. And so you're seeing more growth in our higher-margin businesses like Sheffield and Service Finance, but they carry higher normal losses. And then I think most importantly, something that we control is our efforts to get ahead of the CRE office risk. So in Q3, we were very intentional about working through moving from just identifying the risk there to actually resolving several of the problem credits. And we took some losses there to do that. And we're anticipating maybe opportunities to do more in Q4. So I think those are the three factors that will impact where losses go. Ryan Kenny : Great. Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Brad Milsaps for any closing remarks. Brad Milsaps : Okay. Thanks, Anthony. That completes our earnings call. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team. Thank you for your interest in Truist, and we hope you have a great day. Anthony, you can now disconnect the call. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Currently, all participants are in listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Mr. Brad Milsaps. Brad Milsaps : Thank you, Rocco, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist's fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. With us today are our Chairman and CEO Bill Rogers and our CFO Mike Maguire. During this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's fourth quarter results, share their perspectives on current business conditions, and provide an updated outlook for 2024. Clarke Starnes, our Vice Chair and Chief Risk Officer; Beau Cummins, our Vice Chair and Chief Operating Officer; Donta Wilson, Chief Consumer and Small Business Banking Officer; and John Howard, Truist Insurance Holdings Chairman and CEO are also in attendance and available to participate in the Q&A portion of our call. The accompanying presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information, are available on the Truist Investor Relations website ir.truist.com. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review these disclosures on slides two and three of the presentation regarding these statements and measures, as well as the appendix for appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. With that, I'll turn it over to Bill. Bill Rogers : Thanks, Brad and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call today. Before we discuss our fourth quarter results, let's begin with our purpose on slide four. As you know, Truist is a purpose-driven company committed to inspiring and building better lives in communities. I'd like to take just a few moments to highlight some of the ways we demonstrated our purpose during 2023. Through Truist Community Capital, we committed nearly $2.1 billion to support more than 15,000 units of affordable housing. This helped create more than 15,000 jobs and serve more than 130,000 people in low and modern income communities this year. Also, our teammates impacted 5,300 organizations and causes through their charitable giving and more than 62,000 hours of volunteer service. In addition, we started a small business community heroes initiative, which empowers our branch teammates alongside our virtual small business specialist leveraging our digital solutions to proactively connect via caring conversations with small business owners, who tirelessly work to serve our neighbors, create jobs, build our communities, and help drive our economy. So those are just a few examples of the meaningful work we're doing as a company to have a positive impact on the lives of our clients, our teammates, our communities, and our shareholders as we work to realize our purpose. All right, so let's turn to some of the key takeaways on slide six. Truist reported solid fourth quarter results, adjusted earnings after excluding several discrete items that impacted our results. The largest of these items, of course is a $6.1 billion goodwill impairment charge. Mike's going to provide more details later in our call, but this is the result of our annual impairment test, which we conduct each year as of October 1. So importantly, this is -- charge is non-cash, it has no impact on our liquidity, regulatory capital ratios, the payment of our common dividend, or our ability to do business and serve our clients. On an adjusted basis, we reported net income of $1.1 billion or $0.81 a share, which excludes the impact of the impairment charge, the industry-wide FDIC special assessment, and a discrete tax benefit. In addition, pre-tax merger related and restructuring charges of $183 million negatively impacted adjusted EPS by $0.10 per share. Most of these charges were related to our cost saving plan. Despite these discrete items in the quarter, we're pleased with our underlying results. As you can see on the slide, our solid performance was defined by several key themes. First, we made strong progress on our organization simplification plan during this quarter. Since these initiatives were announced in mid-September, we've reduced headcount, relined significant elements of our organizational structure to improve efficiency and to drive revenue opportunities in 2024 and beyond. As a result of these efforts and others through 2023, the fourth quarter marks the second consecutive quarter we've seen our expenses decline. Although the first quarter will experience typical seasonal expense headwinds, we're on track and fully committed to delivering on the cost initiatives that we outlined in September, which will limit adjusted expense growth to flat to up to 1% in 2024, while also continuing to invest in initiatives for our core clients, technology, and risk management. Although asset quality is normalizing off historically low levels, we're encouraged that non-performing loans decline during the quarter, while we continue to build our loan loss reserve considering the uncertain economic environment. Consistent with our capital planning strategy, our CET1 ratio increased 20 basis points sequentially to 10.1. Although we're committed to building capital, our balance sheet also remains open to core clients as our primary capital priorities are supporting the financial needs of new and existing clients and the payment of our common dividend. So before I hand the call over to Mike to discuss our financial performance in more detail, let me provide a quick update on our progress we're making on improving the experiences for our clients, we'll do that on slide seven. Truist continues to see improved digital engagement trends with strong transaction growth over the last year. Mobile app users grew 9% versus the fourth quarter of 2022, which is contributing to increased transaction volumes, which now account for 62% of total bank transactions. As shown in the chart on the left, growth in digital transactions is primarily reflected by increased Zelle usage as clients continue to value efficient payment and money movement capabilities. While this is certainly positive, Truist still has a meaningful opportunity to shift the transaction mix even more towards digital, specifically by leveraging our T3 strategy, which is the concept that touch and technology work together to create trust. That further enhances the client experience and drives greater digital adoption and efficiency. Our goal is to create seamless experiences for our clients by offering more self-service capabilities to enhance the overall client experience. Truist Assist is a perfect example of this concept. Since launching in 2022, we've seen increased client adoption with one-third of the total interactions represented in the fourth quarter of 2023 alone. Additionally, 85% of the conversations were completed using the automated assistant this quarter. As we look into 2024 we expect accelerated adoption of Truist Assist, which should lead to additional operational efficiencies for Truist. Overall, I'm pleased with the digital progress we've made in 2023 and excited about the opportunity to further leverage T3 in 2024 and beyond that. So let me turn it over to Mike to discuss our financial results in a little more detail. Mike? Mike Maguire : Great, thank you Bill and good morning everyone. For the quarter we reported a GAAP net loss of $5.2 billion or $3.85 per share. As Bill noted reported earnings per share were impacted by several items detailed at the top of slide eight. Those include a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $6.1 billion, a special FDIC assessment of $507 million, and a discrete tax benefit of $204 million. Excluding these three items, adjusted net income was $1.1 billion or $0.81 per share. In addition, merger-related and restructuring charges, primarily related to severance and branch consolidation associated with our call-saves initiatives, negatively impacted EPS by another $0.10. Before providing further details on this quarter's underlying financial performance, I do want to provide some additional background on the goodwill impairment charge that occurred during the quarter. We test our goodwill for impairment annually on October 1. This year's test resulted in an impairment of $6.1 billion. The impairment was primarily driven by the continued impact of higher interest rates and higher discount rates and a sustained decline in banking industry share prices, including Truist share price. Importantly, as Bill noted in his opening remarks, this is a non-cash charge and has no impact on our liquidity, no impact on our regulatory capital ratios, our ability to pay our common stock dividend or to serve the needs of our clients. Moving on to the results for the quarter. Total revenue increased 50 basis points sequentially due to a more modest decline in net interest income than expected. Adjusted expenses declined 4.5% or 5.2%, if excluding the impact of TIH Independence Readiness Costs. Our net interest margin improved 3 basis points to 2.98% during the quarter. We added 20 basis points to CET1 capital in the quarter and increased our ALLL ratio by 5 basis points in light of ongoing economic uncertainty. Finally, our tangible book value per share increased 13% on a linked quarter basis, due primarily to the impact of lower interest rates on the value of our available for sale investment portfolio. Next, we'll turn to page nine to cover loans and leases. Average loans decreased 1.7% sequentially, reflecting our ongoing balance sheet optimization efforts and overall weaker client demand. Average commercial loans decreased 1.8%, primarily due to a 2.3% decrease in CNI balances, primarily due to lower client demand. In our consumer portfolio, average loans decreased 1.8%, primarily due to further reductions in indirect auto and mortgage. Overall, we expect average commercial and consumer balances decline modestly in the first quarter driven by our ongoing mix shift toward deeper client relationships, deemphasizing lower return portfolios, and the effects of continued economic uncertainty. Moving now to deposit trends on slide 10. Average deposits decreased 1.4% sequentially as growth in time deposits and interest checking was more than offset by declines in non-interest-bearing and money market balances. Non-interest-bearing deposits decreased 3.7% and represented 29% of total deposits, compared to 30% in the third quarter and 34% in the fourth quarter of 2022. During the quarter, consumers continued to seek higher rate alternatives, which drove an increase in deposit costs, albeit at a slower pace relative to recent periods. Typically, total deposit costs increased 9 basis points sequentially to 1.90%, down from a 30 basis point increase in the prior quarter, which resulted in just a 100 basis point increase to our cumulative total deposit beta to 36%. Similarly, interest bearing deposit costs increased 10 basis points, sequentially to 2.67%, down from a 38 basis point increase in the prior quarter, which also resulted in a 100 basis point increase to our cumulative total interest bearing deposit beta to 50%. Going forward, we will continue to maintain a balanced approach, focusing on core relationships, staying attentive to client needs, and striving to maximize the value we can add to relationships outside of rate paid. Moving the net interest income and net interest margin on slide 11. For the quarter, taxable equivalent net interest income decreased by 0.6% linked quarter due to lower average earning assets and higher rate paid on deposits partially offset by favorable hedge income. Reported net interest margin improved 3 basis points on a linked basis quarter. While net interest margin expanded in each of the last two quarters, we expected to contract in the first quarter due to an increase in rate paid on deposits partially offset by continued improvement and spreads on new and renewed loans. Turning the non-interest income on slide 12. Fee income increased $47 million or 2.2% relative to the third quarter. The linked quarter increase was primarily attributable to higher service charges on deposits, which were up $76 million in the fourth quarter, due primarily to the third quarter being impacted by $87 million of client refunds. Lending-related fees increased $51 million linked quarter, due to higher leasing related gains. And other fees declined $66 million due to lower equity income. Fee income was down 3.2% on a like quarter basis as lower investment banking and trading, deposit service charges, mortgage banking and other income were partially offset with higher insurance income and higher lending related fees. Next I'll cover non-interest expense on slide 13, GAAP expenses of $10.3 billion increased 6$.5 billion linked quarter due primarily to the previously mentioned $6.1 billion goodwill impairment charge, the $507 million FDIC special assessment, and a $108 million increase in merger-related restructuring expense, partially offset by a $183 million decline in personnel costs. Excluding these items and the impact of intangible amortization, adjusted non-interest expense declined 4.5% sequentially or 5.2%, excluding the impact of $33 million of TIH independence readiness costs. The decrease in adjusted expense was driven by lower personnel expense due to the execution of our cost savings program, resulting in headcount reductions, as well as lower incentive compensation to reflect our performance in 2023. These improvements were partially offset with higher professional and outside processing expenses. Adjusted non-interest expenses were essentially flat on a light-quarter basis. As Bill mentioned, we are pleased with the progress that we've made on the cost savings initiative that we announced in September. Our original goal was to eliminate or avoid expenses of approximately $750 million over a 12 to 18 month period, which would help us manage our expense growth in 2024 to flat to up 1%. The largest category of savings targeted in our plan was a reduction in force driven by a company-wide assessment of spans and layers of management, the elimination of redundant functions, and the restructuring of certain business lines. We've made significant progress here. FTEs are down 4% from June 30 to December 31 with the final set of reductions underway in the first quarter. The second category we highlighted included cost savings opportunities that would be driven by organizational simplification. Examples include reimagining our go-to-market strategy and CRE, simplifying our benefits programs, and right sizing our branch network and related staffing. As part of these efforts, we anticipate reducing the size of our branch footprint by nearly 4% during the first-half of 2024. In addition to lowering headcount and simplifying our organization, we also reexamined our technology investment spend. Through this process, we have rationalized, rescoped, or delayed the start of a number of projects primarily in non-core areas. We estimated restructuring costs related to this initiative to be approximately $225 million or 30% of our initial $750 million goal. So far, we have incurred around $200 million of charges related to the program, mostly driven by reductions in force in the facilities-related decisions. We would expect to recognize the bulk of the remaining costs in the first quarter. It's clear to state here that the work is never done and we continue to assertively manage costs. But we feel confident that we will achieve our flat to up 1% expense target for 2024. Okay, moving on to asset quality on slide 14. Asset quality metrics continue to normalize in the fourth quarter, but overall remain manageable. Non-performing loans declined 6% linked quarter, while early stage delinquencies increased 11 basis points sequentially due to an increase in 30 to 89 day past due consumer and C&I loans. Included in our appendix is an updated data on our office portfolio represents 1.7% of total loans. We are pleased that non-performing and criticizing classified office loans decreased modestly linked quarter, while we increased the reserve on this portfolio from 8.3% at September 30 to 8.5% at year end. During the quarter our net charge off ratio increased 6 basis points to 57 basis points. The increase in net charge offs for the quarter reflects increases on our other consumer, indirect auto and C&I lending portfolios partially offset by lower CRE losses. We continued to build reserves as provision expense exceeded net charge-offs by $119 million. Our ALLL ratio increased to 1.54%, up 5 basis points sequentially, and 20 basis points year-over-year, due to ongoing credit normalization and greater economic uncertainty. Consistent with our commentary last quarter, we've tightened our risk appetite in select areas, though we remain -- maintain our through-the-cycle supportive approach for high-quality long-term clients. Turning now to capital on slide 15. Truist added 20 basis points of CET1 capital in the fourth quarter through a combination of organic capital generation, disciplined RWA management, and this quarter's tax benefit, partially offset by the FDIC special assessment. With a CET1 ratio of 10.1%, Truist remains well-capitalized relative to our minimum regulatory requirement of 7.4% that became effective on October 1. We remain committed to building capital and do not have plans to repurchase shares over the near-term. We continue to be disciplined with our RWA management strategy as we allocate less capital to certain businesses, though we have been clear that our balance sheet remains open to core clients. Our primary capital priorities are supporting the financial needs of new and existing core clients, as well as the payment of our $0.52 per share quarterly dividend. In addition, we continue to believe that Truist\u2019s capital flexibility with Truist Insurance Holdings is a distinctive advantage. We estimate that our residual 80% ownership stake provides greater than 200 basis points of additional capital flexibility and we continue to evaluate our strategic options with respect to TIH. The table in the center of the slide provides an updated analysis of our AOCI at year-end. During the fourth quarter, the component of AOCI attributable to securities declined from $13.5 billion to $11.1 billion or by $2.4 billion due to the decline in long-term interest rates during the quarter and finished 2023 essentially flat when compared to year-end 2022. AOCI related to our pension plan improved from $1.5 billion to $1.1 billion, which is a level that will remain static throughout 2024. Based on estimated cash flows in today's forward curve, we would expect the component of AOCI attributable to securities to decline from $11.1 billion at the end of the fourth quarter to $8 billion by the end of 2026 or by approximately 28%. We continue to feel confident in our ability to meet the requirements and build capital under the proposed phase and periods based on our assessment of the proposed capital rules. We have refined our estimate for the impact to risk-weighted assets under Basel III and now expect a mid-single-digit increase in risk-weighted assets, compared to our previous estimate of a high-single-digit increase. Finally, as it relates to the proposed rules for a long-term debt requirement, we estimate the Truist binding constraint is at the bank level and that the shortfall is approximately $12 billion. We remain confident that we will be able to meet the proposed requirement at both the bank and the holding company level through normal debt issuance during the phase-in period. As part of our regular way funding plan, we issued $1.75 billion of long-term debt during the fourth quarter of 2023. All right, I'll now turn to page 16 to review our updated guidance. Looking into the first quarter of 2024, we expect revenues to remain flat or decline by 1% from 4Q 2023 GAAP revenue of $5.8 billion. Net interest income is likely to be down 3% to 4% in the first quarter, which is more than we experienced in the fourth quarter due primarily to one less day, a smaller balance sheet, and some pressure on our net interest margin driven by rate paid. We expect linked quarter improvement in non-interest income due to higher insurance and investment banking and trading income partially offset by lower other and lending related fee income. Adjusted expenses of $3.4 billion are expected to increase by 4%, due to normal seasonal increases related to payroll taxes and higher incentive accruals. For the full-year 2024, we expect revenues to decrease by 1% to 3%. Our balance sheet and interest rate sensitivity continue to be positioned as relatively neutral, which is in line with our long-term goal. Our forecast assumes that net interest income troughs in the first-half of 2024, and then remains relatively stable, assuming five reductions in the Fed funds rate with the first reduction coming in May 2024. In addition, we assume that insurance continues to grow at high-single-digit rate, while investment banking and trading should benefit from a recovery in capital markets. Although we anticipate adjusted expenses rising 4% in the first quarter due to seasonal factors, full-year 2024 adjusted expenses are still expected to remain flat or to increase 1% over 2023 adjusted expenses of $14 billion, which includes TIH Independence Readiness Costs. Our 2024 expense guidance of flat to up 1% also includes $85 million of TIH independence readiness costs. In terms of asset quality, we expect net charge-offs of about 65 basis points, reflecting a continued normalization of loss rates across our consumer and wholesale loan portfolios, a lower denominator from declining loan balances, and our strategy to be proactive in resolving higher-risk portfolios. Finally, we expect our effective tax rate to approximate 17% or 20% on a taxable equivalent basis. I'll now turn it back to Bill for some final remarks. Bill Rogers : Thanks, Mike. So looking back at 2023, I'm really proud of the work our teammates accomplished, which helped accelerate our transformation into a simpler, more profitable company. As I discussed in September, our transformation is centered on improving efficiency and realigning certain aspects of our leadership and operating model within our three current operating segments, wholesale, consumer, and insurance, to increase our efficiency and drive revenue opportunities. In the third quarter, we've realigned and consolidated several lines of business within consumer and wholesale, including creating a single enterprise-wide payments group, consolidating three commercial real estate units into one, and consolidating four consumer lending platforms to leverage technology and capital resources. During the fourth quarter, we announced significant leadership appointments within consumer and wholesale, and we formed a new operating council composed of key business leaders from across the organization. These leaders will help improve accountability, efficiency, and ultimately drive better growth across our platform while controlling risk, all of which are primary benefits of the simplification plan. These strategic organizational changes designed to improve long-term revenue growth are complete, and we're beginning to see the impacts from our cost savings initiative. To that end, and as Mike discussed, our cost saving efforts are going well and reflect the planning and execution that was ongoing throughout 2023. These cost saving efforts are funding important investments in our risk management infrastructure and core businesses, while also helping to offset natural expense growth in other parts of our organization. We accomplished all of this while growing net new deposit accounts, strengthening our balance sheet through organic capital growth, and strategically allocating our capital to core businesses. Looking beyond the fourth quarter, our top priorities for 2024 include growing and deepening relationships with our core clients, leveraging our more efficient platform to gain market share, achieving our expense target, and enhancing Truist\u2019s digital experience through T3, all while building capital and maintaining strong risk controls and asset quality metrics. We believe there's a significant potential to help our clients achieve their financial success by delivering our commercial consumer payments, investment banking, wealth, and insurance capabilities throughout our existing footprint. In investment banking, we've increased our market share across virtually all of our capital markets products. We've seen a significant increase in the number of lead roles across several products, including investment grade, equity capital markets, leverage finance, and asset securitization. In addition, our mind share with clients and our key industry verticals has never been stronger as we continue to expand in new verticals that are primed for growth as capital market activity recovers. For all of our wholesale businesses, recent changes in client coverage strategies should allow us to focus more intently on opportunities in the middle market where we can bring unique perspective given the breadth and depth of our platform, especially in areas like investment banking and payments. We're seeing solid year-over-year growth in CID referral revenue from commercial banking as we continue to deliver value-added advice and capabilities to our clients. Truist Wealth, which beginning in 2024, will be part of our wholesale business segment, has seen positive asset flows in 10 of the last 11 quarters. By bringing the Wealth business over to wholesale, we'll go to market as one team to deliver business transition advisory solutions to commercial and corporate clients. In consumer, I'm encouraged that customer satisfaction scores have returned to pre-merger levels. In addition, net new checking account production was positive in 2023 as we added 59,000 new consumer and 53,000 new business accounts. And during the fourth quarter, we acquired more than 114,000 accounts through our digital channel, including 33,000 new to Truist. While the branch network presents opportunity for further efficiency in certain markets, we're seeing improvements in productivity due to excellent teammate execution and investments in technology as evidenced by the increase in net new deposit accounts. We're encouraged by this increased productivity, and we'll look to make investments in branches and select key growth markets in 2025 and beyond. So in conclusion, the fourth quarter was solid, but we acknowledge there's more work to do as we strive to produce better and more consistent results in the future. We view our fourth quarter performance as another step forward in that direction. We're making strong progress on areas on our control including managing our expenses, building capital, and realigning our business, so that it is well positioned to serve new and existing clients as markets recover. We're firmly committed to achieving our expense target in 2024, while we will continue to build and allocate capital towards core clients in our home markets, which we view as a distinctive competitive advantage. This heightened focus will lead to increased franchise and shareholder value over time. Let me close by just thanking our teammates for their incredible purposeful leadership in 2023. Teammates, your focus and commitment fuels our confidence in 2024 and beyond. Thank you. So with that, Brad, let me turn it back over to you for Q&A. A - Brad Milsaps : Rocco, at this time, will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session? As you do that, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourselves to one primary question and one follow-up, in order that we may accommodate as many of you as on the call as possible today. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. John McDonald : Hi, good morning. Mike, I was wondering if you could unpack the outlook for the net interest income in 2024 a little bit, including, you know, the assumptions around deposits and whether taking out some Fed cut assumptions would change the outlook and how sensitive they are? Thanks. Mike Maguire : Yes. Good morning, John. No problem, so I guess if you think about \u201824 NII, I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we've got five cuts in our base plan, the first in May, and then really another 25 at each meeting with the exception of November. On balances, you know, we mentioned I think, you know, loans probably a touch of pressure in the first quarter, maybe down less than 1%. And then relatively stable on the C&I side, we see a nice, a more stable outlook for the year on the consumer side, a bit of pressure. Deposits, sort of, picking up where we left off in the fourth quarter, so down call it a 1.5% or so in the first, and then declining, but I think albeit it may be a declining rate over the year. So that's, I think, the primary piece. You know, John, we think about repricing. And I think you've heard from peers as well on this. I mean, probably a bit of caution warranted around the betas. So we think that some of the faster stuff that moved on the way up probably moves fast on the way down, but there's still going to be a considerable amount of repriced lag. And so I guess those are the fundamentals. And then I guess you asked about cuts and whether there were fewer. I think we mentioned we're relatively neutral versus our base case on the five cuts. So whether there are three or four, maybe six or seven cuts, I think we have less sensitivity there. That being said, I think it's an area where there are no cuts, you know, that would be, or significantly delayed cuts, that would be a headwind for us. John McDonald : Okay, and then just a quick one on expenses, the guide for adjusted expenses, you know, in the 14 area. What expenses should we keep in mind for a modeling that are outside that adjusted so that you have some amortization that's usually, I guess, around $500 million and then some merger restructuring expected this year? Mike Maguire : Yes, and you're right on the amortization that would be excluded. On the Mercs, you know, we mentioned, you know, we've got 25 left on our cost savings initiatives based on estimates in the first quarter. You know, they'll be down versus last year. You know, so, you know, should not be as much noise in \u201824 as we saw in \u201823. John McDonald : Okay. And I guess just other Mercs or incremental operating costs, like any of that throughout the year that we should keep in mind or placeholder for some of that to occur beyond the first quarter? Mike Maguire : You know, maybe just to touch, John, but I don't expect that to be a significant factor in our \u201824. John McDonald : Okay, great, thank you. Operator : Thank you, and our next question today comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Scott Siefers : Thank you. Good morning everybody. Mike, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about sort of how you might see loan demand projecting through the years? Certainly understand and appreciate the comments about a little more pressure on loan balances in the early part of the year? And then more stability, but just curious how you're thinking about whether demand can come back if we begin to get some rate cuts, more macroeconomic clarity, et cetera? Mike Maguire : Yes, Scott, I think you're right. I think in our base case, we're assuming a couple of things. The five cuts we think will benefit demand a touch, but to the extent that that's underestimated, that would be welcome news. And I think we mentioned from a C&I perspective, we do expect modest growth in that portfolio, at least in the second quarter, third quarter, and beyond. I think most of the pressure that we're seeing for the year is still on the consumer side. Others may weigh in on other factors, Bill? Bill Rogers : Yes, and it's not just part of the pressure on the consumer side is we're creating, you know, as we're really reducing some of our focus on, you know, indirect as an example. And that's somewhat offset by the growth in Sheffield and Service Finance, but that doesn\u2019t sort of isn't a perfect balance in there. So the consumer reflects probably a little more of our own action and capital allocation than where we are from a market perspective. And then I think as Mike said, I mean, on the C&I side, you know, we're open for business, you know, so, you know, we're going to serve our markets. And I think we've got really, really strong markets. And when I think recovery comes, it will come disproportionately faster in our markets. And if that happens sooner, we'll see the benefit of that. And we'll be a recipient of that, because we are, I think, gaining share in most of those capabilities. And then the other part I just mentioned is that like and when we're winning, we're winning more disproportionately, so on the C&I side particularly, you know, just you know 15% to 20% more of the deals are in left leads as an example. So, you know, if we look at some of our portfolio last year, we're winning more on the left side. So that's got more profitability and more tailwind in terms of an ability to expand those relationships. So I don't know if we're being conservative, to use that word, but I think we've got to sort of see what's in front of us. And hopefully by the end of the year, you know, if the rates turn out as we all forecast, we'll see a little spur in the economy and I think we'll be direct beneficiaries of that. Scott Siefers : Perfect. Thank you. And then, Mike, just a more minutia-oriented one. Obviously great to see the nearly $3 billion improvement in AOC. I'm curious if you have an estimate for what your adjusted or sort of fully loaded common equity Tier 1 ratio is relative to the stated 10.1%? Mike Maguire : Yes, Scott, I can give that to you. So, you know, on a stated basis, you know, we finished the quarter at 10.1%. You know, if you look at our -- the new balance from an OCI perspective, and this would include the AFS security, as well as the pension, that's about a 2.9% impact. So that would take you down to, you know, call it, I guess 7.2%. And then, you know, the other factors like the thresholds and the RWA inflation we mentioned, you know, earlier in the call that we have done more work around an estimate for what the RWA impact might be under Basel and also a little more work on the thresholds, call those another percent. So that walks you down to low-6s. Scott Siefers : Okay. Perfect. All right. Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question today comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hey, Bill, I'm wondering if the optimization, maybe you could call it Truist 2.0 is going fast and deep enough, and I do recognize two items. One, you\u2019ve mentioned headwinds in the past from rates, regulation, and retooling. And second, your new efforts, the $750 million savings program, 4% less headcount, 4% less branches ahead. But then I look at the core efficiency numbers, I'm like, oh, this is not what we signed up for, right? I mean, slide eight, nine, I think lists your core efficiency at 59% in 2023, and now you're guiding worse for 2024, and your pre-emerger target was 51%. So are you guys doing enough and doing it fast enough to optimize? Bill Rogers : Yes, Mike, I think an appropriate challenge is always, we've done a lot. So I think I'm really encouraged by the momentum and you can see it really in the third and fourth quarter. And you see that significantly and particularly the expense declines. And we're committed to what we, you know, what we talked about in September. I think our $750 million plan, I'm really proud of our teammates. I'm proud of our leadership. You know, they really got the sleeves rolled up and got after it. So the intensity that's in this company right now about being more efficient, I feel is demonstrably better. And being able to apply that over this more simplified organizational structures where we see the benefits. So if you think about, as I've made in my comments, I mean sort of that process is complete. So now this intensity, these efforts, these initiatives, we apply that over a much more simplified business model. And the decisions that leaders are making, I think are just better, stronger decisions, which lead us to a more efficient company long-term. Mike Mayo : My follow-up on optimization, I'll give to my colleague, insurance analyst, Elyse Greenspan. Elyse? Elyse Greenspan : Yes, thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. On the insurance side, I know there's been press reports on the potential monetization and sales process of that asset. So I was just hoping that you can provide, you know, an update to us and just, you know, where you stand with that process? Bill Rogers : Yes, so I think we've said pretty clearly that, the insurance business creates a capital opportunity for us and then like outlined that in a lot of specificity. We've said clearly that we're always evaluating alternatives and we're going to do the best thing for the insurance business and the best thing for Truist going forward. And I don't think as it relates to any specific timing and those type of things, I don't think I really should comment beyond that. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, thank you. Bill Rogers : Great, thanks. Operator : And our next question today comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Hey, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask you to expand a little bit on your outlook for credit. Noticing the NPA decline this quarter and you have an expected charge off normalization path. I'm just wondering what you're seeing in terms of what areas of the portfolio you're expecting to see that loss trend higher in the most and just your general sense of just how the customer set feels in terms of, you know, that certainly implies a good ramp from here, but one that's controllable. So just kind of juxtaposing that NPA decline with your expected ramp and losses? Thanks. Clarke Starnes : And this is Clarke. Thanks for the question, our \u201824 NCO guidance, as Mike said, it assumes we're going to continue to see normalization occur, both in consumer and wholesale. We've already seen a lot of it in the consumer side. We have a higher mix, as Bill said, of higher margin consumer finance businesses and less relative mortgage and prime auto, that's a factor on the loss assumption. But I think the biggest one that you\u2019ve pointed out, we're working really hard to get ahead of any potential areas of stress, think CRE office and so our guidance also reflects opportunities to be opportunistic to work through if we see more challenges in that space as that structural risk unfolds. So we hope to do better, but we're assuming we're going to work hard to make sure of that we get ahead of any risk. Ken Usdin : Thanks, Clarke. And just one follow-up, I'm just wondering, I know you said that you're expecting a hopeful bounce in the investment banking business. Just wondering where those level of conversations are and just given your mix of business, where we might expect to see that either come back sooner or have a lag relative to the environment? Thanks. Bill Rogers : Yes, great question. And the good news is we've got a really good balanced investment banking business. So, and, you know, seeing some positive things on, you know, a lot of the different buckets. So if you think about equity capital markets, I mean they're starting to come back. I think we're starting to see some IPO components of that. Our pipeline there is probably the strongest it's been in a long time. And pipeline as active book runner. When and if all that comes to bear, I think that's we'll just have to, that'll be a little bit market dependent. On the debt side, sort of the high yield investment grade, I mean, you've got a lot of maturity sort of running off in \u201824, so there's sort of a natural refinance opportunity. I think, again, sort of that'll be where clients are projecting where they think rates are going to come. So they've got a lot of natural things they have to do and they'll have to pick that point of demarcation where they want to start the refinancing side. And then the M&A pipeline is really strong. We spent a lot of time in energy with our verticals and being really relevant. So the size and scope of some of the things that we're doing are proportionally higher, but we've also built this really great pipeline with our transition advisory business, with our commercial clients. And we've got more in the pipeline there than we closed all of last year, just as an example. So that's sort of that core bread and butter kind of work. And then we have things that were like public finance, which was sort of a nascent business for us 12, 18 months ago, and now starting to build up some momentum and as we see public finance opportunities starting to grow. So we have a lot of cylinders that are working that I think can offset each other and would be a good reason that we would be confident in a pretty nice recovery on the investment banking side. It will be like everything else, a little bit quarter-to-quarter dependent, but hopefully a little less volatility for us given that we've got a lot of cylinders running. Ken Usdin : Great. Thanks, Michael. Mike Maguire : Yes. Operator : And our next question today comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. The first question is for Bill. Bill, Mike is not saying anything too different about loan growth from the rest of your peers for 2024. That being said, I think obviously one of the genesis of the merger of equals is this combined franchise in this footprint that was better than everybody else's? So I guess my question here is, you know, how much of your current adjusted capital, state right now is sort of impacting still how you're thinking about growth and going to market? And you know, clearly there's going to be a lot of questions on use of proceeds, you know, if you do sell the rest of Truist Insurance Holdings. But how much different is your approach going to be to market, if at all, if you do monetize TIAs? Bill Rogers : Yes, let me answer the first part of that as well. So, you know, I think that's a great question. And, you know, if you look at sort of the barometer, I was trying to say this earlier on sort of where we go, I think we will reflect our economy and our opportunities. So, and we'll just have to see sort of how that gets unleashed going forward. And I think the correlation will probably be more directly seen in the C&I side, because we're -- as I mentioned before, not just a capital preservation, but or optimization, but really more around optimization around return and sort of looking at our core and non-core. So we've pulled the throttle back on some of the consumer side that we consider to be less capital efficient. So that's got a little bit of an overhang in terms of where we look at this. I think if we go into 2024 and trying to answer your question, I think the barometer for us ought to be on the parts of consumer where we're investing and C&I overall. And as I said earlier, I think when we see the recovery, we'll see it more disproportionately in our markets and we should reflect that. So I think that's exactly right. But the net of your whole question, we're not capital constrained in terms of the opportunity for growth in the business, in poor business, in the places where we're investing. Erika Najarian : Got it, And just a follow-up question for Mike. One of your peers had framed it this way, so I think the investors found it helpful. But you did mention earlier that you had caution on the betas to the downside, and your first cut is presumed to be May. Considering a lag could you give us a sense of what your range of assumptions is in terms of downside betas for the first 100 basis points of cuts that's embedded in your guide? Mike Maguire : Yes, Erika, you know, I'm not -- it's a great question, and one we're spending a lot of time on. Look, I mean, I think initially out of the gates, and if these come, call it, you know, \u201825, you know, at a time and you think about the first 100s so the first four for us, I think the first-half of that, it's going to be really pressured by guys still repricing up across the retail business and certain products and segments. So I guess my use of the word cautionary is thinking about kind of where we're ending up right now on a cumulative beta perspective and just acknowledging that we're going to be lower than that out of the gates for certain. But I don't think, if you think about our NII outlook, I think you've got a pretty good sense for how we're thinking about the reprice trend. And we mentioned we think in the first quarter in sort of a static rate environment, we're going to be down 3% to 4% on balances and day count and a touch worse on rate paid. And you know, from there, as we start to see the cuts, in our case, we think we flatten out and are pretty stable. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hey, good morning. I guess, I just wanted to follow-up maybe Bill and Mike on the goodwill charge. I'm assuming it's more than a mathematical exercise and it's hard for me to imagine that higher rates are structurally bad for banking organizations with good deposit base, which is the case for Truist. So to some extent I guess the read-through is some of the deal synergies tied to the SunTrust BB&T merger no longer look as appealing as they did at the time of the deal announcement. One, is am I missing something there? And secondly, Bill, just so you've talked about a bunch of strategic actions, is it fair for us to expect that if we look a year from now, we will see very clearly some of the synergies, be it in terms of market share gains, efficiency tied to the deal where investors can start getting on board with the franchise? Mike Maguire : Yeah, I'll go on the first one. Ebrahim, thanks for the question. You know, you sort of said, hey, I assume it's sort of not just math, or maybe you said it is mathematical, and that's right. I mean, at the end of the day, we do an annual test for impairment. There are I mean thousands and thousands of factors that go into this work. There are customary evaluation approaches. You know, you evaluate each reporting unit. You know, if you think about it the factors that are significant that we cited in our prepared remarks is that you do have a very you know you've had degradation in operating conditions for the industry you had a significant decline in broadly speaking bank stock valuations, Truist market valuation at the time and we do this test as of a certain day each year. In our case, it's October 1. So all those factors are considered and influence the outcome. But at the end of the day, the estimated fair value is below the carrying value, and that's the output. But again, just to reiterate this, absolutely zero impact to our financial condition or how we think about our opportunity or our strategy or what we're doing. Bill Rogers : And it's just done by segment too, Mike. Mike Maguire : Yes, that's right. You look at the various reporting segments, the reporting units for us, which are the consumer and wealth business, at least in \u201823, corporate and commercial, and then insurance. Bill Rogers : And then on your second question, hopefully, what I was indicating is that process has started. So if you look at the net new account gains we're seeing, the growth in primacy accounts, the growth in market share and investment banking. So those things are actually underway and happening. I think they'll continue to accelerate, they'll continue to build, they'll continue to manifest, as you said, both on the revenue and both on the efficiency side. I think you actually pointed out, you know, you'll see both sides of that. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. Thanks for that. And just one quick follow-up. When we look at the commercial real estate multifamily book, there are a bunch of like Southeast markets that are probably seeing a fair amount of supply coming through. Any concerns, I mean, what are you seeing in the multifamily CRE today, and any markets where you are particularly focused on in terms of oversupply over the next year or two? Bill Rogers : Yes, I'll give Clarke to comment as well. But yes, there are, you know, part of the great part of our markets is we have a lot of in-migration. So we've had a lot of building in anticipation of that. So if you think about some of our larger markets, Austin, Orlando, I mean, some of the suspects where you've seen a little bit of that. I'll get Clarke to comment on the quality of the portfolio. So that you know the multifamily, large developers that were in and long-term the migration positive continues. So I was looking at some data interesting enough just to make a comment broadly on that. Within our markets last year, we added a metropolitan Charlotte. So just think about that in context. So we added about 2.2 net in-migration into our market. So the overall demographics are good, but I think in fairness to your question, we probably have a little bit of a shorter term watch item versus worry item. Maybe Clarke, you can\u2026 Clarke Starnes : I agree with you, Bill. Overall, we still think multifamily long-term is a very favorite asset class and some of the current challenges from our perspective relate more to a margin or current debt service coverage risk issue, given rate increases, higher operating cost, and to your point the new pipeline supply that's coming on. And we just view that very differently than the structural risk we see in office as an example. So we're working with our borrowers to address their specific situations as we look out and how they're going to address this impact. Again, so what we would expect more temporary increase in watch lists, some non-accruals, but nowhere near the same loss risk exposure you see in office. And I would remind you that there's very active secondary placement sources, a lot of equity sources willing to come in. And the clients that we have, to Bills point, they want these assets and they're supporting those. So we think it's a manageable risk, even though there's some short-term pressure. Ebrahim Poonawala : Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O'Connor: Hi, good morning. Sorry I missed it, but have you guys talked about what your targeted capital level is? You know, obviously you said going from here with no buybacks in the near-term and again, with the impact on the RWAs from the Basel III and getting proposals, but how are you thinking about targeted capital levels over the medium and long-term? Thanks. Bill Rogers : Yes, Matt, for right now, we're at 10.1 in building. And so I think until we get more information, until we sort of understand the dynamics a little bit more and think about our company construct, I think the best thing for us right now is to be in an organic capital building mode. So we haven't set a specific target, but I think 10 plus for the short-term, the medium term seems a good place for us to be landing right now. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And as you think about kind of the 10 plus medium term, is that including AOCI? Because obviously you're already 10 plus now and you're going to create capital fairly quickly this year with things given earnings and not much balance in growth? Mike Maguire : Yes, no, Matt, I think we're just, you know, in the moment we're in, you know, we're looking at spot capital, we're thinking about transitioned, you know, capital measurements if we phase into new rules and we're looking at fully phased in. I think the whole industry is thinking about it that way. So I think when Bill thinks about 10, I mean I think about it on a transitional basis, staying at or above 10 is probably what Bill is implying. But I think shorter term is like we're building capital, we're going to continue to do that through organic earnings and hopefully we'll have a little more visibility on this rule and can give you a little better sense for kind of a medium term target. Matt O'Connor: Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Bill. Good morning, Mike. Bill, when we go back to the original merger, I think if I recall correctly, there was a targeted 20% return on tangible common equity and you've just discussed about the capital levels, you know, Basel III being higher than what I presumed to be lower numbers back and when the deal was announced? Can you share with us, are you still thinking 20% return on tangible common equity is a reasonable goal or you can attain it even with these higher capital levels that you and the industry has to carry? Bill Rogers : Yeah, I mean, I think, Gerard, if we go back to 2019, that was a different world and a different environment, both in terms of, you know, where we were from a rate standpoint and where we were from a capital standpoint, regulatory standpoint. Now we've got Basel III in front of us. So I think in fairness 20, certainly short and medium term is not necessarily in the windshield. But I think we can continue to perform at a high level in terms of ROTCE. And so all the efficiency opportunities and things we're building, revenue growing, those are things that are continuing to build on that. So I think to think about us being a top performer in that category versus setting a specific target that was constructed in 2019 in a different environment is maybe a different way to think about it. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then coming back on -- obviously, you guys talked about credit quality. You referenced, Mike, about commercial real estate in your opening remarks and you just talked about multifamily again. And Truist has always been good on its credit. So my question on commercial real estate in the office area, and maybe this is for Clarke, can you kind of draw a line for us from early \u201822 when there wasn't really any problems before rates started to go higher in downtown office, really, or maybe just emerging? And incrementally, it's clearly deteriorated. Clarke, can you share with us, is the deterioration accelerating on a sequential basis in the office market? Or have we seen the rapid acceleration of down values, real workouts taken charge-offs? And going forward, yes, you're still going to see higher charge-offs probably, but the actual incremental deterioration is lessening or worsening, can you share with us from that standpoint? Clarke Starnes : Great question we talk a lot about, Gerard. And so I would say as I mentioned, as opposed to multifamily, we view the risk in the CRE sector as more structural, and it still will take some time to play out over the next couple of years. And the way we think about it, everyone with credit in the sector is exposed to the risk. And so the big challenge will be for those that have large concentrations, which we don't. So we feel good about that. And our strategy has been to try to identify the risk early and work through with those borrowers to address all options. And you see that in how we approached risk rating, accrual status and reserves. So that's kind of where we are right now. We feel good about our efforts. But to your point, we still think about the fact there are very few real trades today. So it's hard to know what real price discovery and whether we've hit the bottom of the cycle or not. I think everyone's trying to recognize that and so you've seen that acceleration. What I think is still left to come incrementally, as we are still seeing, as leases fully mature, companies, lessees resizing their space needs. And so you can have performing loans today and a good outlook, but you really don't know until you see the leases mature. The other thing I would say is we are seeing some interest, some early interest on long-term investors coming in and that may help. So I would say still more to come. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you. Operator : We have room for one final question and that comes from Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Manan Gosalia : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to come back to the NII guide, and I appreciate all the detail on loan growth and deposit betas. Can you talk about how we should think about the impact of securities repricing and the impact of swaps as we think through that 2024 NII? Mike Maguire : Yes, no problem. On the securities repricing side, not a huge factor. As you know, our speeds, we mature, call it, $2 billion to $3 billion per quarter, and so probably not as big of an impact on -- in terms of upside for '24. But as you think about the swap book, I think, I mentioned in the fourth quarter, we had a little bit of a tailwind to the tune of, call it, $20 million to $25 million relative to Q3. Our outlook for '24, really interesting enough, the first half, it's a tailwind with some of the payers in our portfolio. But we do have some received fixed swaps that will become effective throughout the course of the year, which will later in the, call it, first-half begin to mute the benefit and then by the second half, create a headwind. But for the full year impact, it's actually negligible at least based on the current curve. But that's all factored into our NII outlook. Manan Gosalia : Got it. And just as we think through the sensitivity to the different rate environment, I think you mentioned some forward starting swaps. Is there any more color, any quantification there? Or anything else we need to think through in terms of the impact on NII from any swings in the forward rate assumptions? Mike Maguire : Look, I mean, like we disclosed this. I mean if you look at our swap portfolio, we've got about $30 billion of receivers on today. About $10 billion of those will be effective sort of day one this year, and by the end of the year, most will be effective. But again, that's incorporated into our outlook. Manan Gosalia : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Brad Milsaps for closing remarks. Brad Milsaps : Okay. That completes our earnings call. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team. Thank you for your interest in Truist, and we hope you have a great day. Rocco, you may now disconnect the call. Operator : Thank you, sir. This concludes the conference call. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a wonderful day.",

Currently all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, today's event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Brad Milsaps. Brad Milsaps : Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist's first quarter 2024 earnings call. With us today are our Chairman and CEO, Bill Rogers; our CFO, Mike Maguire; and our Vice Chair and Chief Risk Officer, Clarke Starnes, as well as other members of Truist's Senior Management team. During this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's first-quarter results, share their perspective on current business conditions, and provide an updated outlook for 2024. The accompanying presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the Truist Investor Relations website, ir.truist.com. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on slides two and three of the presentation regarding these statements and measures, as well as the appendix for appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. With that, I will turn it over to Bill. Bill Rogers : Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. So before we discuss our first quarter results, let's begin as always with purpose. We see that on slide four. Truist is a purpose-driven company dedicated to inspire and building better lives and communities. And I'd like to share some of the ways we brought purpose to life last quarter. Our focus on small-business heroes is a great example of purpose-driving performance This strategy helps community heroes achieve their financial dreams and elevates their ability to support our neighbors and build strong communities. We're seeing great success with small business, evidenced by the addition of nearly 8,600 small business accounts during the quarter and $700 million worth of deposits. Our Truist Community capital team committed more than $252 million to support over 1,600 units of affordable housing, over 3,000 new jobs, and projects that will help empower almost 400,000 people in underserved communities over the next three years. Additionally, we announced the initial recipients of grants from the Truist Community Catalyst Initiative, which is a three-year Community Reinvestment Act program aimed at four key focus areas : Affordable housing, small business access to capital, workforce development, and essential community services. There are 17 community organizations receiving grants that will be used to support efforts in 54 communities across 13 states and allow local non-profit organizations to better respond to critical community needs within their states. Lastly, we published our 2023 Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability report this month, which I encourage you to read and learn more about our progress in building better lives and communities. In all of these examples, our core belief is evident. We're leaders in banking and we are unwavering in care. All right, so let's turn to some of our key takeaways on slide six. First, I need to state and remind everyone that our first quarter and for the previous periods have been restated to reflect the pending sale of Truist Insurance Holdings. This change has no impact on our net income available to common shareholders. The restatement does remove TIH's revenue and expense from our financial statements as net income from TIH has now been reported as net income from discontinued operation. Mike is going to provide a lot more details around that later in the call. On an adjusted basis, we reported net income available to common shareholders of $1.2 billion or $0.90 a share, which excludes a $0.04 per share impact from the industry-wide FDIC special assessment, and a $0.05 per share impact from the acceleration of incentive compensation at TIH due to the pending sale. Pre-tax restructuring charges of $70 million negatively impacted adjusted EPS by $0.04 per share. So despite a few discrete items in the quarter, we're pleased with our underlying results. As you can see on the slide, our solid performance was defined by several key themes. First, we saw a significant increase in investment banking and trading revenue, driven by strong performance across much of our capital markets platform with particular strength in M&A and equity capital markets. Loan demand continues to remain relatively muted, but we did see some improvement in our commercial lending pipelines during the quarter. On the consumer side, we recalibrated several of the capital-conserving strategies we deployed last year, prior to announcing the sale of TIH. This resulted in an increase in loan applications and in March, we saw the first increase in balance since October of 2022. Second, our results show our expense discipline and continued focus on managing cost. As a result of these efforts, adjusted expenses increased by less than 1% linked quarter and decreased by 4% on a year-over-year basis. Although, the linked-quarter rate of expense growth will increase in the second quarter relative to the first, we are fully committed to delivering our expense objectives in 2024, which excluding TIH should now result in adjusted expenses remaining approximately flat in 2024 versus 2023. Our asset quality continues to normalize of historically low levels, but we're pleased that non-performing loans remained relatively stable and the net charge-offs were within our expectations. Finally, during the quarter, we also announced that we'll be sell -- we'll sell our remaining stake in Truist Insurance Holdings, which is on track to close in the second quarter. The sale of TIH will significantly strengthen our relative capital position, which will create substantial capacity for growth in our core banking businesses. In addition, as we discussed in February, our stronger capital position affords us an opportunity to evaluate a variety of capital deployment opportunities post-closing, including a potential balance sheet repositioning designed to at least replace TIH earnings. The sale of TIH also positions us to resume share repurchases. The timing and size of repurchase activity will be -- will depend on our ongoing capital planning, market conditions, clarity around final capital rules, and other factors. But our goal is to resume a program that's both meaningful and durable. Before I hand the call over to Mike to discuss our financial performance in more detail, I want to provide a quick update on the progress we're making and improving experiences for our clients, which we see on slide seven. We continue to show strong and steady growth in our digital capabilities. In the first quarter of 2024, mobile app users grew 8% and digital transactions increased 13%, compared to the first quarter of last year. Though activating teammates -- through activating teammates to educate clients on our capabilities, transactions continue to shift towards self-service capabilities with 77% of the deposits occurring through these channels, primarily driven by strong growth in Zelle transactions. Recently, we rolled out Zelle QR code widget, where users can quickly access their QR codes from their home screens to seamlessly assist with bank transfers. At Truist, we aim to make banking simple and easy for our clients through thoughtful enhancements to their experience. Enhanced offerings coupled with strong growth in digital have resulted in higher retail digital client satisfaction scores. These scores surpassed pre-merger highs as we continue to focus on accelerated adoption and efficiency using our T3 strategy. Overall, I'm proud of the continued momentum Truist is making in digital and optimistic about the opportunity to expand our digital user base and drive self-service transaction volume. So with Mike -- with that Mike, let me turn it over to you to discuss our financial results in a little more detail. Mike Maguire : Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, our financial statements for the first quarter and for previous periods have been restated due to the pending sale of Truist Insurance Holdings. This restatement has no impact on our net income or earnings per share for historical or current reporting periods. However, and as you can see on our financial tables, revenue and expense associated with TIH is no longer shown on our financial statements. TIH's contribution to Truist net income and earnings per share is now captured in net income from discontinued operations. My comments today will focus on revenue and expense from continuing operations, although I will also provide some detail on revenue and expense for the quarter inclusive of TIH for comparative purposes. We reported net income available from continuing operations of $1 billion or $0.76 per share, which includes a $75 million pre-tax or $0.04 per share after-tax expense related to the industry-wide FDIC special assessment. We reported net income available from discontinued operations, which represents earnings from TIH of $64 million or $0.05 per share, which includes an $89 million pre-tax or $0.05 per share negative impact from the acceleration of incentive compensation at TIH due to the pending sale. So on an adjusted basis, we reported net income available to common shareholders of $1.2 billion or $0.90 per share, which includes adjusted net income from continuing operations of $0.80 and adjusted net income from discontinued operations of $0.10. In addition to the items I just noted, we also had pre-tax restructuring charges totaling $70 million in the quarter, which negatively impacted adjusted EPS to common shareholders by $0.04 per share. The bulk of these charges were related to severance and real-estate rationalization. Total revenue, which excludes revenue associated with TIH, decreased by 1.4% linked-quarter due to a decline in net interest income, partially offset by stronger non-interest income led by investment banking and trading. Revenue before the impact of discontinued operations accounting increased 0.2% on a linked quarter basis. Adjusted expenses, which excludes adjusted expense associated with TIH, increased by 0.7%. Adjusted expenses before the impact of discontinued operations accounting increased 1% on a linked quarter basis. Next, I'll cover loans and leases on slide nine. Average loans decreased 1.3% sequentially, reflecting overall weaker client demand and our decision to deemphasize certain lending activities during 2023, which impacted growth during the first quarter. Average commercial loans decreased to 0.9%, primarily due to a 1.2% decrease in C&I balances due mostly to lower client demand. In our consumer portfolio, average loans decreased 2%, primarily due to further reductions in indirect auto and mortgage. During the quarter, we did increase our appetite for high-quality indirect auto loans, which as Bill mentioned, resulted in consumer loan balances showing positive growth for the month of March. Overall, we expect average loan balances to decline modestly in the second quarter, albeit at a slower pace than the first quarter. Moving to deposit trends on slide 10. Average deposits decreased 1.6% sequentially as growth in client time deposits and interest checking was more than offset by declines in non-interest-bearing brokered and money market balances. Approximately $1.9 billion of the $6.3 billion linked quarter decline in average deposits was due to lower brokered deposits. Adjusting for broker deposits, our average deposits declined approximately 1%. Non-interest bearing deposits decreased 4.9% and represented 28% of total deposits, compared to 29% in the fourth quarter of 2023. During the quarter, consumers continued to seek higher-rate alternatives, which drove an increase in deposit costs. Specifically, total deposit costs increased 11 basis points sequentially to 2.03%, which resulted in a 2% increase in our cumulative total deposit beta to 38%. Similarly, interest-bearing deposit costs increased 11 basis points sequentially to 2.82%, which also resulted in a 2% increase in our cumulative total interest-bearing deposit beta of 53%. Moving to net interest income and net interest margin on slide 11. For the quarter, taxable equivalent net interest income decreased by 4.2% linked quarter, primarily due to higher rate paid on deposits, lower day count in the quarter, and lower average earning assets. Reported net interest margin declined 7 basis points on a linked quarter basis, due primarily to higher rate paid on deposits. Turning to non-interest income on slide 12. Non-interest income increased $83 million or 6.1% relative to the fourth quarter. The linked quarter increase was primarily attributable to higher investment banking and trading income, which was up $158 million linked quarter, due to strong results across much of our entire capital markets platform with specific strength in M&A and equity capital markets. Lending-related fees decreased $57 million linked-quarter due to lower leasing-related gains. Non-interest income increased 1.8% on a like-quarter basis, as higher investment banking and trading, wealth, and other income were partially offset by lower service charges on deposit and mortgage banking income. Next, I'll cover non-interest expense on slide 13. GAAP expenses of $3 billion decreased $6.6 billion linked quarter, as fourth quarter 2023 expenses were negatively impacted by a $6.1 billion goodwill impairment charge, a $507 million FDIC special assessment, and $155 million of restructuring charges primarily related to our cost-savings initiatives. Excluding these items and the impact of intangible amortization, adjusted non-interest expense increased 0.7% sequentially. The increase in adjusted expense was driven by higher personnel expense of $156 million due to normal seasonal factors and higher variable incentive compensation, partially offsetting the increase in personnel expense were lower other expenses, which declined $82 million, reflecting lower operating charge-offs and lower pension expense. Adjusted non-interest expenses before the impact of discontinued operations, accounting -- discontinued operations accounting increased 1% on a linked quarter basis. On a like quarter basis, adjusted expenses declined $120 million or 4.2%, reflecting lower headcount and continued expense discipline. Moving to asset quality on slide 14. Asset quality metrics continue to normalize in the first quarter, but overall remained manageable. Non-performing loans remained relatively stable to linked-quarter, while total delinquencies were down 6 basis points sequentially, driven by a 7 basis point decline in loans 30 to 89 days past due. Included in our appendix is updated data on our office portfolio, which is virtually unchanged at 1.7% of total loans. However, we did increase our reserve on this portfolio from 8.5% to 9.3% during the quarter to reflect continued stress in this sector. We expect stress to remain in the office sector, but believe that the size of our office portfolio is manageable and well reserved. Approximately 5.5% of our office portfolio is currently classified as non-performing, but 89% of these loan balances are paying in accordance with the original terms of the loan. During the quarter, our net charge-offs increased 7 basis points to 64 basis points. The increase in net charge-offs for the quarter reflects increases in our CRE and consumer portfolios, offset by lower C&I and CRE construction losses. Our ALLL ratio increased to 1.56%, up 2 basis points sequentially, and 19 basis points on a year-over-year basis due to ongoing credit normalization and stress in the office sector. Consistent with our commentary last quarter, we've tightened our risk appetite in select areas that we maintain our through-the-cycle supportive approach for high-quality long-term clients. Turning now to capital on slide 15. Truist's CET1 ratio remained relatively stable on a linked-quarter basis at 10.1%, as organic capital generation and the impact of lower risk-weighted assets were mostly offset by the impact of the CECL phase-in that occurred during the quarter. We still anticipate the sale of TIH will generate approximately 230 basis points of CET1 under current rules and 255 basis points of CET1 capital under proposed Basel III endgame rules. It will also increase our tangible book value per share by 33% through a combination of a $4.8 billion after-tax gain and the deconsolidation of $4.7 billion of goodwill and intangibles from our balance sheet. The divestiture of TIH has a 255 basis point positive impact under the fully proposed phase-in Basel III endgame rules, which is 25 basis points higher than under current rules. The larger impact on our CET1 ratio under the proposed rules is due to the reduction in certain threshold deductions due to the overall higher level of capital from selling TIH. The sale of TIH accelerates our ability to meet increasing standards for capital and liquidity in the industry. And importantly, creates capacity for Truist to evaluate a wide variety of capital deployment alternatives, including growing our core banking franchise during a time when much of the industry is conserving capital, repositioning our balance sheet, and resuming share repurchases. As it relates to a possible repositioning, recognizing securities losses under proposed Basel III rules would have no impact on our fully phased-in CET1 ratio since current proposed rules include AOCI in the calculation. Moreover, any decision to sell market value securities has no impact on our tangible book value per share. I will now review our updated guidance on slide 16. First, all of my comments today related to second quarter and full-year 2024 guidance exclude any benefit from interest income that Truist will earn on the $10.1 billion of after-tax cash proceeds that we expect to receive from the pending sale of TIH. Our guidance also excludes any impact from a potential balance sheet repositioning that we plan to evaluate post-closing. In addition, revenue and expense guidance for the second quarter and full year 2024 is based on revenue and expense from continuing operations and does not include any contribution from TIH in previous or in future periods. Looking into the second quarter of 2024, we expect revenue to decline about 2% from 1Q '24 GAAP revenue of $4.9 billion. Net interest income is likely to be down 2% to 3% in the second quarter due to continued pressure on rate paid and a smaller balance sheet. We expect non-interest income to remain relatively stable on a linked-quarter basis. Adjusted expenses of $2.7 billion in the first quarter are expected to increase 4% in Q2, due to higher professional fees, some timing of projects delayed from Q1, higher marketing costs, and annual merit increases. For the full-year 2024, we previously expected revenues to be down 1% to 3%, which would have included revenue from Truist Insurance Holdings. If we had excluded revenue from Truist Insurance Holdings from our outlook, our expectation would have been closer to down 3% to down 5% in 2024. Today, we are tightening our previous revenue guidance adjusted for TIH of down approximately 3% to down 5% to now down approximately 4% to 5% to reflect the latest interest-rate outlook and continued pressure on the deposit mix, partially offset by our improved outlook for non-interest income. Our outlook assumes three reductions in the Fed Funds rate with the first reduction coming in June 2024. Previously, we assumed five reductions in the Fed Funds rate with the first reduction occurring in May 2024. We still assume that net interest income will trough in the second quarter of 2024 and modestly improve in the second-half of the year. Fewer than three rate reductions would add pressure to our NII outlook and result in our annual revenue coming in at the lower end of our range for revenue to be down 4% to 5%. As a reminder, our second quarter and full-year revenue outlook excludes any benefit from interest income earned on the cash proceeds from the sale of TIH or the benefit of potential balance sheet repositioning. As Bill mentioned, we still expect the sale of TIH to be completed during the second quarter. We previously expected our expenses to remain flat or to increase by 1% in 2024, which included expenses associated with Truist Insurance Holdings. If we had excluded expected expenses from Truist Insurance Holdings from our outlook, our expectation would equate to expenses remaining approximately flat in 2024. Consistent with our previous expense outlook adjusted for TIH, we expect full-year \u201824 adjusted expenses to remain approximately flat over 2023 adjusted expenses of $11.4 billion. In terms of asset quality, we continue to expect net charge-offs of about 65 basis points in 2024. Finally, we expect our effective tax rate to approximate 16% or 19% on a taxable equivalent basis. Our estimated tax rate excludes any impact from the gain on the sale of TIH or a potential balance sheet repositioning that we might consider following the sale. So now I'll turn it back to Bill for some final remarks. Bill Rogers : Great. Thanks, Mike. I am proud of the results our teammates delivered during the first quarter, which included solid underlying earnings, improved momentum, and the announced sale of Truist Insurance Holdings. As Mike mentioned, TIH will enter its partnership with its new investors with strong momentum as evidenced by its first quarter results. Providing risk advice to our clients is core to our purpose, we look forward to maintaining a strong partnership with that team into the future. We have great confidence in our capability to grow our core banking business and help our clients achieve financial success by delivering our commercial, consumer, payments, investment banking, and wealth platform throughout existing footprint, and specialty areas. Our top priorities for 2024 are unchanged and include growing and deepening relationships with core clients, maintaining our expense discipline, evaluating various capital deployment options following the sale of TIH, and enhancing Truist's digital experience through T3, all while maintaining and strengthening strong risk controls and asset quality metrics. Our expense discipline is showing up in our results, which gives us confidence that we'll meet our expense objectives this year. I'm also encouraged by the improvement in our wholesale banking business, which includes investment banking and trading as it was a key driver of our quarterly results. In investment banking, we've increased our market share across several capital market products due to significant investment in talent and industry verticals. These investments have resulted in significant increase in the number of lead roles across several products, including equity capital markets, leveraged finance, asset securitization, and M&A. In addition, our mind share with clients in our key industry verticals has never been stronger and we continue to expand into new verticals that are primed for growth as capital markets activities recover. We are seeing solid year-over-year growth in referral revenue from commercial banking as we continue to deliver value-added advice and capabilities to our clients. Our commercial teammates have responded to new expectations and we continue to add great talent to our comprehensive platform. And finally, we made new key leadership hires within our payments business during the quarter as this is an area where we see significant opportunity for growth over time. In consumer, I'm encouraged that our internal consumer satisfaction scores have returned to pre-merger levels. In addition, net new checking account production was positive in the first quarter as we added 30,000 new consumer and business accounts. Importantly, we're also seeing year-over-year improvement in account attrition rates. Also during the first quarter, our digital channel, we acquired 172,000 accounts, including 63,000 new to Truist, while also seeing a 14% increase in deposit balances over the fourth quarter of 2023. While the branch network represents opportunity for further efficiency in certain markets, we continue to see improvements in productivity due to teammate execution and investments in technology. We're encouraged by this increased productivity, we'll look to make investments in branches and select key growth markets in 2025. Overall, loan demand does remain muted, but I'm encouraged by the improvement in our commercial loan pipelines and the growth we witnessed in consumer balances late in the first quarter. By selling TIH, we'll have capital capacity to play more offense in our consumer and wholesale businesses, which includes seeking ways to accelerate loan growth in our core franchise. In addition, our significantly stronger balance sheet will be positioned to weather an even wider range of economic environments, while also giving us the unique ability to evaluate a variety of capital deployment opportunities post-closing, including a potential balance sheet repositioning and resuming meaningful share repurchases later in the year. Although we have a plan to replace TIH earnings in the near-term, we recognize that our increased level of capital will result in near-term dilution to our return on average tangible common equity ratio. Our starting point for ROTCE following the sale of TIH will be exactly that, a starting point. The strength of our markets, our core banking franchise, our capital deployment options we can consider after the sale will result in improved returns over time. We'll move with pace, but we'll not be in a rush to deploy capital to meet short-term expectations that don't have a long-term positive impact on our company, our clients, our shareholders, especially since Basel III capital rules have not been firmly established for the industry. So in conclusion, we're off to a solid start in 2024, but we acknowledge, as always, there's more work to do as we strive to produce better results in the future. We view our first quarter performance as another step forward in that direction. I'm optimistic about our future, I look forward to operating our company from this increased position of financial strength in some of the best markets in the country. And finally, I'd like to thank all of our teammates and our leaders for their incredible purposeful focus and productivity, particularly over the last few months during this important time for both TIH and for Truist. So with that Brad, let me hand it back over to you for Q&A. Brad Milsaps : Thank you, Bill. Jamie, at this time will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session. As you do that, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourselves to one primary question and one follow-up, in order that we may accommodate as many of you as possible today on the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from John McDonald from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead with your question. John McDonald : Great. Thank you. Good morning. How the rate environment changes at all -- if at all, the ability and willingness to deploy through the restructuring of the securities book. Mike, maybe you could just comment higher rates, presumably achieving that neutral impact gets a little bit easier. Does that affect how much you might do? And maybe Bill could just make some broader comments about the options you'll have to deploy organically and buybacks and other things? Thank you. Mike Maguire : Yes. Thanks, John, for the question. Look, I mean -- we're certainly taking a look at the market rate environment and I'd say just the framework that we shared back in February, we remain committed to, right? And, so we laid out a set of objectives that spanned maintaining a relative capital position, at least replacing the earnings from TIH, we also have ambitions around advancing our liquidity and ALM position. So the rate environment and we talked about that in February is a touch different than what we're looking at today, but we think still, you know, actionable and so we -- our plans to evaluate repositioning after we complete the sale are still intact. I mean, if you look at the short-end of the curve, certainly, we see probably a little bit of benefit relative to what we talked about from a cash reinvestment perspective, and the same goes if you think about reinvestment rates on the bonds, but on the other hand, you do have the trade-off of a slightly higher realized loss in that instance. Bill Rogers : I'll go into the others, and as you said, John, I mean, we're in a different rate environment, so we'll evaluate all the other alternatives that exist with that, and there's some things that have some shorter paybacks that I think should be evaluated in that alternative. And then also we have some tax efficiency as it relates to this. So we have some unique components of doing this in line with the TIH sale. And then you mentioned sort of what are the other capital deployment options? You know obviously, the first and foremost for us is growth in our business. I mean sort of investing in our business. You saw in this quarter some of the things we did on the consumer side where we leaned in a little bit. Quite frankly, we think some of the margins are still strong in those businesses. So that, what we're adding is a little more accretive than it would have been in the past. The risk profile has been strong. So we have the capacity to dial some of that up on the consumer side. And then on the wholesale side, just our relevance is more important. So what we're -- we don't want to give up all the discipline. We created a lot of discipline around pricing and around structure and again, what we're adding today is much more accretive. So we'll continue to pursue opportunities in our markets and through our industry verticals and we've got good momentum in that front. And then lastly, on the share repurchase side, we're going to--we'll be back in the share repurchase business, that will be part of the portfolio. As I mentioned before, we're going to do all this with pace. So I think it would be -- you know, reasonable to assume we'll have some type of meaningful share repurchase sort of -- sort of short, medium-term, and then longer-term, and just a more durable consistent share repurchase plan. So it's a combination of all those things factored into the equation, which give us, as I said before a lot of optimism about being able to improve those returns short-term, importantly, but most importantly over the long-term. John McDonald : That's really helpful, thanks. And maybe as a quick follow-up, we saw a really strong investment banking results this quarter. How much of that is good environment versus payback on some of the investments you've made in that business, and maybe just comment on what's packed in your outlook for the second quarter there, Mike? Thanks. Mike Maguire : Yes. I mean, a lot of it obviously is from market improvement, but as you noted, I mean, we've been investing in this business for quite some time, particularly over the last several years. You know, our existing team has really set horizon to the challenge. They're working really great with the commercial team. So we're seeing all the pull-through from our franchise, we've brought 30 plus new MDs into our -- into our business. So these are teammates with great expertise and great access. So I think it's a combination of all those things and we're really confident. I mean, we're confident heading into the second quarter and the rest of the year about the momentum in this business. John McDonald : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Mike Maguire : Hi. Bill Rogers : Betsy, good morning, and welcome back. Betsy Graseck : Thanks so much. Bill Rogers : Great. Great to hear your voice. Betsy Graseck : Thanks so much, Bill. I really appreciate it. So I did just want to lean in on the loan side, a couple of comments in the prepared remarks that you made. One was on commercial lending pipelines building and I wanted to understand, is this a change? And I mean, we often hear about pipelines in the investment banking side, not as much on the commercial lending side. And I wanted to understand your thoughts around what execution on that requires, is it lower rates, is it customers building more inventory, or just some color on that would be really helpful? Thank you. Bill Rogers : Yeah. And I did note it because it's a little bit different. So in the fourth quarter, we started seeing pipelines decrease a little bit. And here in the first quarter, we've seen pipelines improve, particularly on the commercial side. You know, how they get to execution and how they get to finalization will depend on a lot of market conditions. But the good news is clients are -- they're having the discussions, they're having the debate about the new warehouse or the new fleet of trucks the things that they want to do to continue to expand their businesses. But most importantly, we're just more relevant. I mean, we're just more relevant in those discussions. I mean, the activity that we've been able to create in terms of new relationships, I mean, almost 60% of the activity that we added in the quarter were new relationships. So new to Truist. So I think a lot of it's at pitch activity is up, all the things we're doing, new left leads are up. So I think it's some combination of a little bit of the markets that we operate, probably a little more optimistic than the rest of the country. Our investments that we've made, products, capabilities, and our overall relevance with our clients. So we're talking to them about things they want to listen to, they want to talk about, and I think we're just better-positioned than we've ever been. Betsy Graseck : And is that -- okay, so then the follow-up is on the auto side, you mentioned that you're leaning into indirect and high quality. So I just wanted to understand, you know, what does high-quality indirect autos mean to you? And then the relevance to corporate clients increasing, is that a function of balance sheet size or product mix or maybe you just -- I know I squeezed in two, but it was a follow-up plus a follow-up? Thanks. Bill Rogers : Betsy, you get extra permission. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thank you. Bill Rogers : Yes, exactly. Yes, so on the auto side, maybe to compare and contrast, it's not rack for us, it's sort of our core prime auto business in terms of growth. And again, just being able to be a little more relevant to our dealers, and creating a little more capacity, you\u2019ve seen lots of changes from people in and out of the auto side. We like the consistency of it. And again, we have a deep strong relationships with lots of dealers and this just adds to that portfolio. And then on the corporate side, same thing on the -- if the question was related to the risk profile, similar kind of risk profile, I mean, we're -- we created, as I said, a lot of discipline over the last year in terms of we were optimizing capital and we want to continue to do that. So the same expectations that we have for full relationships, the same expectations we have for our risk profile. So I think everything we're adding is just more accretive than what we were adding before based on our capabilities. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thank you so much, Bill. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead with your question. Scott Siefers : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Let's see, Mike, I wanted to just ask a little on the guide and the nuance. So if I understood it correctly, on an apples-to-apples basis, the full-year guide is the same for expenses, but tightened up to the low-end of a prior range as better fees are offset by slightly weaker NII outlook. So hopefully, I got that right. But within there, just curious for expanded thoughts on what has changed within the NII expectations. I imagine the preponderance of it is just fewer rate cut expectations with the 3% versus 6% previously, but maybe you could speak to other factors such as deposit mix or pricing nuance that might have impacted as well? Bill Rogers : Yes. Scott, you made it easy for me. Those are the answers. So for us, we had five cuts back in January. I think the market had six. We're looking now at 3%. I think the market has 2% or fewer, frankly. And so I think maybe one nuance to our outlook is that we believe that sort of 4% to 5% manages three cuts or even fewer cuts than 3%. So perhaps worth noting there. And then beyond just the curve , we have just -- and I think our expectation in January, we were six months from the last hike and here we now sit at nine months, and we probably had an expectation that there'd be a touch less churn and pressure on pricing and mix on the liabilities portfolio side. So those are the two factors. And then, of course, we're seeing some strength on the fee side. So put that in the blender and 4% to 5% feels right. Mike Maguire : Yes. It's Mike, as you know that does not include TIH repositioning. So we still have to say all this in the same setup [Multiple Speakers] Scott Siefers : Yes, I totally understand. Thank you. And then, Mike, maybe just on sort of the competitive environment for funding. On the one hand, it's a general question, but also curious to hear your thoughts in so far as there are a lot of out of market competitors encroaching on your pretty attractive demographic markets. Just curious to hear -- just your thoughts on sort of rationality of funding pricing. Are they having a visible impact or is the market pretty rational as to what you would expect in a higher for longer environment? How are those things all projecting? Mike Maguire : Yes. I mean, look, we -- one of the benefits of operating in such attractive high-growth markets is they're attractive to others as well. And so it's always been a competitive marketplace for us. But I don't think we're seeing -- I would -- what I would describe as irrational behavior in the market. I think we're at a little unusual moment in the cycle being as high as we are for as long as we've been here. And so you're seeing a variety of strategies, but by and large, I think people are all trying to solve the same problem we are, which is when will we perhaps see some relief on the rate side. Meanwhile, we're really just focused on supporting our clients, right? So we've got the right products we think, and the right client experiences. And we're going to pay a competitive rate to defend the relationships that you would expect us to defend. Bill Rogers : It's also, Scott, why we focus on net new. So in addition to, sort of, the pricing within our existing portfolio, we want to make sure we're adding net new accounts. So our rate of acquisition has been really strong, and our rate of attrition has been improved. So those are important barometers for us to sort of look at the overall health of the franchise and our relative competitive positioning. Scott Siefers : Perfect. Okay, good. Thank you all for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question. Ken Usdin : Hey, thanks, guys. Just wondering -- just in terms of sequencing and how we'll understand how the rest of the potential benefits look like following the close of the transaction. I guess just wondering, are you still anticipating a June 1 close? And then do you anticipate like just next earnings season, we'll kind of get the understanding of the full impacts of both cash reinvestment and whatever you may decide to do on restructuring? Mike Maguire : Hey, good morning, Ken. It's Mike. We don't have a date certain on closing, but we have an increasing confidence that Q2, we will be able to complete the transaction. I think once we complete the transaction, we think there'll be an opportunity for us to communicate during the quarter, sort of, what things look like from there? Ken Usdin : Okay, got it. And then just underneath the surface, I guess it's hard because by 3Q, you'll probably have done some of these things, but you mentioned NII down a little bit in the second quarter. Ex the deal, do you have a view of kind of where that core NII would be heading as we look into the second-half of the year and kind of when that gets to a stability point? Mike Maguire : Yes, that's right. In the guide we gave for Q2 is sort of ex any cash or ex any potential benefit from a repositioning. So that's down 2% to 3% is I think what you're asking for at least in the quarter. And we do believe that the second quarter will be a trough for us. So if you think about the third quarter, a, I think we'll get a touch of benefit just on the, a, our baseline has us getting a cut in June. And if you think about the third quarter, maybe a cut and a half if you get September -- early September also. So you got to cut in a half, you've got one extra day in the third quarter and maybe a touch of a larger balance sheet if we start to see a little bit of loan growth come through. So we see some modest improvement in Q3 and the same -- and the same in Q4 sort of a baseline path. I think fewer cuts puts a little bit of pressure on that, but I think we still expect 2Q to be a trough from an NII perspective regardless. Ken Usdin : Okay, great. Yes, it was a second-half point that I was looking for that incremental color on. Mike Maguire : Yes. Ken Usdin : Thank you on kind of how it improves. Okay, and then just one more follow-up on IB. You mentioned the investments you've been making at the quarter was outstandingly good. Are you kind of implying that flat fees in the second quarter that this is a new run-rate for IB and trading? Some other banks have talked about pull-forward in DCM, but I just want to kind of understand the color of where you think the puts and takes are for fee income growth from here? Thanks. Bill Rogers : Yes. I don't think there's been any particular pull forward. This was a particularly strong M&A quarter. M&A is a little less predictable on a quarter-on-quarter basis. But I think as we look sort of, if we're thinking short-term like next quarter, next couple of quarters, I mean, this seems to be a pace that we're operating at right now in terms of our momentum in pipelines. Ken Usdin : Thanks very much, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead with your question. Mike Mayo : Hi, if I can just get one simple question and one more complex question. The simple question is, so you're guiding for a trough in NII in second quarter and that does not include any deployment of the $10 billion. So if you just put the $10 billion, say you get a 5% yield on that, then you get $500 million, that would add 2% to your year-over-year revenue growth. And also, how much would the sale of insurance improve your tangible book value? Mike Maguire : The first question, that's right, Mike. The guidance really for the year-end, and specifically, you asked for the quarter does not include the benefit of the cash. We do expect the cash proceeds after tax to be about $10.1 billion. You know you can pick your forward curve deployment rate, but I think you're in the ballpark. And then your second question was what would be the tangible book value per share improvement from the sale, I think was the question and that would be by roughly, roughly a third. Mike Mayo : Okay. And then, Bill, for you, I know I brought this up before, but we're -- after five years, the announcement of this merger and at least five years ago, as of today, your stock is down one-fourth, the BTX is flat, the S&P is up two-thirds. And I'm looking -- I guess your annual meeting is tomorrow and you talk about leaning into your purpose, inspiring to build better lives. And I just don't see the word shareholder there or on that side. By the way, love purpose purpose-driven capitalism and I love how you bring that up. But I think if you don't bring shareholders along on that slide, you say happiness. I don't think the shareholders are too happy if they've been around for the last five years. So can you just pull the lens back the day before your Annual Shareholders meeting and say what you're doing to help make shareholders happy, assuming that your clients, employees, and communities are happy, how do you bring the shareholders along a little bit more? Thanks. Bill Rogers : Thanks, Mike. So just to be clear in our mission statement, our shareholders are a key component of our stakeholders. So they've never been excluded in terms of -- in terms of -- in terms of our purpose. And I just fundamentally believe that purpose and performance are inextricably linked. So there's just no doubt about that. Do we lean in a lot to clients and teammates and communities during the first part of our merger and during COVID? Absolutely. Are we leaning in equally now with shareholders as a component of all that? Absolutely. And you see some of the actions we're taking, some of the momentum that we're creating. I highlighted in the beginning of this call sort of small business as an example of how purpose and performance are linked. So focus on our small business community heroes, which is great. That's very purposeful, help them build their businesses and help them build their communities, but also meant we added 8,600 of them and we created $700 million of deposits. So I do think they're linked, I think if you sat at our company and listened, you would understand that people make the connection very, very clearly and I'm not confused about that. And I think the actions that we've taken in the fall, the actions that we're taking now, the momentum we've created are solid evidence of our focus on our shareholders as well. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning. I guess... Bill Rogers : Good morning. Ebrahim Poonawala : Maybe just Bill, following up on from a shareholder focus, I think there's a lot of focus around what this company can earn on a go-forward basis as we think about the turn-on tangible equity. Maybe you want to wait for a few months, I appreciate that till the deal closes. But give us a sense, when you look at sort of consensus numbers, 12% return on tangible equity, I'm assuming that's not kind of what you're aspiring for. So give us a framework when we think about your peer set, whether you think you can get there? And then just how quickly given maybe there's still some more tech spend to be undertaken over the next few years? Yeah, if you could start there. Thank you. Bill Rogers : Yes, Ebrahim, I think I hopefully said very clearly that, that'd be a starting point. So that would not be an acceptable return for us long-term. It is a component of a reset. If you think about it, there are -- let me put it into a couple of buckets. So short and medium term, we have a chance to actually move that more demonstrably. So think about the share -- the securities repositioning sort of as a step one and share repurchase a little more meaningful to start with and more durable over time. So we have a short and medium-term unique capacity to increase that. And then long-term has to come from the growth of our business. And we're in the best markets, we are creating momentum in all those segments of our market. We're creating a lot of efficiency. So the -- every dollar of revenue is going to be more efficient in terms of how it produces income for our shareholders over time, and our ability to continue to invest. So you mentioned technology, but all those will be components. So the expenses are related to also our capacity to save money and invest in our company long-term. So short and medium-term, we get -- increase the slope a little bit and then long-term increase the slope over-time. It's a little too early for a sort of a specific target. You know, the target right now is to grow and again grow meaningfully. And as we understand the capital rules a little bit better, get through some of the capital planning, you know, we'll be in a better position to talk about more longer-term targets. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And Mike, just a quick one for you. So it sounds like few rate cuts is negative, but at the same time, the cash will make the balance sheet assets sensitive. With the cash, I mean, I'm just wondering if we have to -- if were to assume there are no rate cuts this year, is that really negative or more a neutral scenario given the cash will be sort of earning higher for longer in that backdrop? If you could clarify that, thank you. Mike Maguire : Yes. Well, Ebrahim, what I was talking about was sort of a continuing ops guide, so ex the incremental cash. So we feel like there'd be downside, right? So our 4% to 5% contemplates three cuts baseline, but fewer cuts as well to the low side. I think if you added the cash, you're right, that would add asset sensitivity and that would just sort of transform our NII trajectory broadly. Obviously, when that asset sensitivity comes onto the balance sheet, we'll manage that consistent with how we've managed rate risk in the past, which is we will probably add some receivers to manage against lower rates longer. I think I answered your question, which is the guide is continuing ops ex-cash. We think the 4% to 5% has that in the cash and any repositioning benefit would be on top of that. Ebrahim Poonawala : That's good. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. What do you think is a good capital level to be running at kind of looking out medium-term, including AOCI? Mike Maguire : Hey, Matt, it's Mike. I'll take a swing at that one. This is -- it's one that tough to get on the record on as you know, I think others are probably in the same boat. I think the good news for Truist is we find ourselves at least once we get our TIH transaction completed in a really strong I think on a relative and absolute basis capital position. You know, with the rules still in a proposal stage, I think it's really hard for us to determine exactly what a target might be. I think we do find ourselves in a position right now of some amount of excess capital. It's impossible to understand exactly what that level would be. But the good news again is, we do have the confidence in our current level such that we can shift from sort of a phase where we've been conserving capital to a phase where we're deploying capital and optimizing that capital and putting it to work and whether that's in the core balance sheet, which would be our first priority is to grow client relationships and balances and make money the old-fashioned way. You know, we obviously been clear that we think there's -- we have the capacity to evaluate a repositioning of the balance sheet. And of course, Bill has been pretty direct about our ambitions around buying back stock. So don't have a target for you, but our sort of tone and mindset and planning is oriented around growth. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then just -- I didn't see any disclosures, but remind me what the adjusted CET1 is right now? And again, obviously, you're picking up a lot in the deal, but what's the starting point right now? Bill Rogers : We're at 10.1% as of the end of the quarter, which is flat to last quarter. You know, we've -- obviously the CECL phase-in impacted the linked quarter advancement. And if you fully phased-in the proposed rules, our AOCI would I think worsen that by a little over 3%, the thresholds a little less than 1%, and then RWA inflation maybe a couple, call it, 20 basis points, 30 basis points. So I think we're around 5.9%, maybe 6% on a fully phased-in basis today. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then obviously, off that 6%, we would add the 2.5% or 2.6% you said, so... Bill Rogers : That's right. Mike Maguire : Yes. Matt O'Connor: Yes. Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Bill. Good morning, Mike. Bill Rogers : Good morning. Gerard Cassidy : Mike, to follow-up on the bond potential restructuring. A technical question, are you guys permitted? I know you can restructure the AFS available-for-sale portfolio. But can you touch the held-to-maturity portfolio as well? And then second, if this Basel III, as we know appears to be delayed because of a big change coming, if Basel III doesn't get solidified and finalized until first or second quarter of next year, how does that impact your guys' decision-making on when to possibly do this restructuring? Bill Rogers : Sure, Gerard. The first question, no, the HTM portfolio wouldn't be eligible for repositioning. We wouldn't be in a position to sell those securities or the consequences that we would have to mark the rest of the HTM securities. In terms of Basel, obviously, we've been engaged in the advocacy there as well. We've been monitoring the evolution of the rule. It does seem at this point that a final rule certainly is delayed versus our -- what we probably would have expected a year-ago or even six months ago. But I don't think we have an expectation that the substance of the rule that's going to be most relevant to Truist is likely to change, which is the inclusion of -- or the deduction of AOCI from regulatory capital. So I think we feel good about our path forward. And look, I mean, I think we were pretty clear in February again around our objectives with a potential repositioning. And just to sort of state it again, I mean, one, whatever we do, we want to make sure that we still have ample capacity to grow the business and execute on the buyback that Bill has mentioned. But it's really important to us to at least replace the TIH earnings in whatever we would -- whatever we would contemplate. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then possibly a follow-up on the commercial real-estate detail you gave us in the appendix. It looked like the non-performing loan percentage declined a bit from the fourth quarter, charge-offs, however, obviously went up, your reserves also went up relative to total loans. Any color that you guys can provide us on what's happening to the mix of the commercial real estate? You know, obviously, your office is the one that we're all focused on, but any other areas that you guys have some color would be great? Thank you. Clarke Starnes : Yes, Gerard, this is Clark. We were very pleased in the quarter. To your point, we did see our total CRE, NPLs go down, and that was driven by deliberate actions we took to continue to work through, the stressed exposure in the CRE office. We actually reduced CRE office $222 million or 4.5% for the quarter, while addressing about $230 million worth of maturity. So as we've said before, we're not going to kick the can down the road. So we're trying to be very intentional about recognizing where we have exposure and going ahead and dealing with that. And that's what created the higher losses for the quarter, but the trade-off was lower NPLs. To your point, we also feel very good about our reserves. Our office reserves were increased to 9.3%. And also for the stressed more institutional style, we're nearly -- we're about 11.8%. So we're well reserved. I would say the other CRE segments are holding up really well. I know there's a lot of talk about multifamily. I'd say for us, what we see there is mostly a migration to the watchlist, but not to NPL or losses yet. And we're working with those borrowers and we're quite pleased that most sponsors are coming in and addressing, resizing if necessary, interest reserves, or other structural ways to keep those performing. So we feel good about the overall CRE book and our trajectory right now. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. I appreciate it. Operator : And our final question today comes from Vivek Juneja from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question. Vivek Juneja : Thanks. Hi, Bill. Hi, Mike. A couple of quick questions. One is the balance sheet restructuring that you're talking about. Any sense of timing in terms of how long is it -- do you expect you get done by assuming you close on June 1? Do you think you'd get done by end of this year or you think it ends -- heads over into '25? Are there any sort of tax reasons why you have any time limitations? Bill Rogers : Maybe let me hit that [button] (ph), so I mean the spirit would be simultaneous. So that would be -- that would be the spirit in terms of you know, how we would -- how we would potentially restructure. Vivek Juneja : Okay. And then, as you restructure Bill, are you thinking you'll replace the securities with other securities? Are you -- I know you're only going to get it to -- you want to get earnings to neutral. Where are you at this point thinking, are you willing to go more? What are you thinking in terms of ongoing run-rate of securities as a proportion of earning assets? Mike Maguire : Yes. Hey, Vivek, it's Mike. I'll take it. In February, what we laid out was sort of an even redeployment into cash and securities. I think even that I think was hypothetical as you can imagine, we are keeping an eye on the market and thinking about the trade-offs around different, whether it'd be mortgages or treasuries and cash. So, I think we'll get that mix right and we'll be guided on not just earnings. Obviously, we have an objective of shortening the balance sheet and improving our, you know our readiness around what we think will be more rigorous liquidity requirements over time. And so that's actually one of the great benefits of this transaction or this collection of potential transactions is, it's not just about capital. This really does move us forward more broadly. Vivek Juneja : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll be concluding today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing remarks. Brad Milsaps : Okay. Thank you, Jamie. That completes our earnings call. If you have any additional questions, please feel free-to reach out to the Investor Relations team. Thank you for your interest in Truist. We hope you have a great day. Jamie, you may now disconnect the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Brad Milsaps. Brad Milsaps : Thank you, Betsy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. With us today are our Chairman and CEO, Bill Rogers; our CFO, Mike Maguire; our Vice-Chair and Chief Risk Officer, Clarke Starnes, as well as other members of Truist's senior management team. During this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's second quarter results, share their perspectives on current business conditions, and provide an updated outlook for 2024. The accompanying presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the Truist Investor Relations website, ir.truist.com. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slides 2 and 3 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures, as well as the appendix for appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. With that, I will now turn it over to Bill. William Rogers : Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. So before we discuss our second-quarter results, let's begin with purpose on Slide 4. As you all know, Truist is a purpose-driven company dedicated to inspiring and building better lives and communities. Purpose is the foundation for things that we do. We believe purpose and performance are inextricably late. I'd like to share some of the ways we brought our purpose to life last quarter. During the quarter, Truist Securities advised and served as an active joint book-runner for Oglethorpe Power's inaugural $350 million green bond, which will be used to support their investment in Plant Vogtle, the largest producer of clean energy in the United States. The company is committed to reducing GHG emissions while delivering cost-effective and reliable clean energy with a diverse energy portfolio. This transaction represents only the second green-labeled bond in the US where the use of proceeds are allocated to nuclear energy. We also launched a new financial education program tailored specifically for high-school and college students called Truist Life, Money, and Choices. This initiative is aimed at empowering younger generations with financial lessons and essential skills to navigate their financial futures. These are just a couple of examples of how we brought our purpose to life during the quarter. I'm very proud of the meaningful work we're doing across our businesses to have a positive impact on the lives of our clients, our teammates, our communities, and of course, our shareholders as we work to realize our purpose. So let's turn to our key takeaways on Slide 6. On an adjusted basis, we reported net income available to common shareholders of $1.2 billion or $0.91 per share, which excludes the gain on the sale of Truist Insurance Holdings, the loss on the sale of certain available-for-sale investment securities, a charitable donation to the Truist Foundation, and a few smaller items that Mike will discuss in further detail in the call. In addition, pre-tax restructuring charges of $96 million, which were primarily related to the sale of TIH and severance, and also negatively impacted adjusted EPS by $0.05 per share. So looking through a few discrete items in the quarter, we're pleased with our underlying results. As you can see on the slide, our solid performance was defined by several key themes. First, we grew adjusted revenue 3% on a linked quarter basis, which was driven by 4.5% growth of net interest income due primarily to the balance sheet reposition we completed during the quarter. Second, our results show our continued expense discipline and focus on managing cost. As a result of these efforts, adjusted expenses increased by 2.6% linked quarter and decreased by 3% on a year-over-year basis. We are fully committed to delivering our objective of keeping expenses flat in 2024 versus last year. We're also pleased that non-performing loans remained relatively stable for the fifth consecutive quarter and that net charge-offs were within our expectations. During the quarter, we also completed the sale of our remaining stake in Truist Insurance Holdings, which significantly strengthened our relative capital position and create substantial capacity for growth in our core banking businesses. In recognition of the incredibly long-term positive impact of our insurance business, we utilized a portion of the gain to make a $150 million charitable contribution to the Truist Foundation to further our purpose-driven work across our banking footprint for years to come. Simultaneously, with the closing of TIH, we repositioned a portion of our available-for-sale investment portfolio, which along with the proceeds received from the sale of TIH, is expected to provide an offset to TIH earnings contribution. Mike will provide more details on these transactions later in the call. In late June, our Board authorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion of our common stock through the end of 2026. We plan to begin repurchasing our shares during the third quarter and we'll initially target share repurchases of approximately $500 million per quarter for the remainder of the year. Finally, we continue to actively pursue growth opportunities in our core consumer and wholesale banking businesses. Although, overall loan demand remained slow during the quarter, I'm encouraged by the underlying momentum in terms of increased wallet share within certain businesses and the talent we're attracting to our company, which I'm going to discuss a little later in the call. So before I hand the call over to Mike to discuss the financial performance in more detail, let me provide a quick update on the progress we're making in improving experiences for our clients on Slide 7. We continue to show strong and steady growth in our digital capabilities as client mobile app users grew 7% and the digital transactions increased 13% compared to the second quarter of last year. Transactions continue to shift towards self-service capabilities, primarily driven by strong growth in Zelle transactions, which are up 39% year-over-year. In addition, we added over 180,000 new accounts during the quarter, including nearly 70,000 new to bank clients through our digital channels, which represents a 17% increase over the second quarter 2023. Importantly, digital checking account production among Gen Z and millennial clients was higher by 42% on a year-over-year basis. A new more modernized small-business digital onboarding experience has also resulted in new high in application completion rates, while we're also seeing increased digital engagement with our small-business clients. We've also made enhancements to enterprise platforms that have empowered teammates to deliver knowledge and care through 1.8 million caring conversations, resulting in 1.4 million accepted recommendations for Great Truist products and services. These enhanced offerings, coupled with strong growth in digital have resulted in higher consumer digital client satisfaction scores as we continue to focus on accelerated adoption and efficiency using our T3 Strategy. Overall, I'm really proud of the continued momentum Truist is making in digital engagement. So with that, let me turn it over to Mike to discuss the financial results in more detail. Mike? Mike Maguire : Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin discussing our second quarter results, I'd like to spend a few moments recapping the strategic actions that significantly impacted our second quarter results. First, on May 6, we completed the divestiture of our remaining ownership stake in Truist Insurance Holdings at an implied value of $15.5 billion. At closing, we received after-cash or after-tax cash proceeds of approximately $10.1 billion and recorded an after-tax gain of $4.8 billion. The sale of TIH created $9.5 billion of capital, which generated 230 basis points of CET1 under current capital rules and 250 basis -- 254 basis points of capital under proposed fully phased in Basel III rules. Our tangible book value per share also increased by 33%. On the same day, we executed a strategic balance sheet repositioning of a portion of our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. We sold approximately $27.7 billion of market value, lower-yielding investment securities, which resulted in an after-tax loss of $5.1 billion. The investment securities that we sold had a book value of $34.4 billion and a weighted average book yield of 2.80% for the remainder of 2024, including the impact of hedges and based on the federal funds curve at that time. Including the tax benefit, the sale of investment securities generated $29.3 billion of proceeds available for reinvestment. When coupled with the proceeds from the sale of TIH, there were $39.4 billion of proceeds available for reinvestment. Of that, we invested approximately $18.7 billion in Investment Securities yielding 5.27%, with the remaining $20.7 billion held in cash. At the time we invested the proceeds, the blended reinvestment rate on the new investment securities purchased and the cash was 5.22% for the remainder of 2024, including the impact of hedges. As Bill mentioned, the reinvestment of the proceeds from the sale of TIH and the balance sheet repositioning completed during the quarter are expected to replace TIH's earnings contributions. These actions completed during the second quarter significantly accelerate our ability to meet increasing standards for capital and liquidity in the industry and importantly, create capacity for Truist to grow its core banking franchise and to return capital to shareholders via our strong dividend and share repurchases. Now turning to our second-quarter key performance highlights on Slide 9. We reported second quarter 2024 GAAP net income available to common shareholders of $826 million or $0.62 per share. This included a net loss of $4 billion from continuing operations or $2.98 per share and net income from discontinued operations of $4.8 billion or $3.60 per share. The net loss available to common shareholders from continuing operations of $4 billion or $2.98 per share was impacted by the following items : a $6.7 billion pre-tax or $3.80 per share after-tax loss on the sale of certain available-for-sale investment securities; a $150 million pre-tax or $0.09 per share charitable contribution to the Truist Foundation, a $13 million pre-tax or $0.01 per share after tax expense related to FDIC special assessment adjustment. Net income available to common shareholders from discontinued operations of $4.8 billion or $3.60 per share was impacted by the following items : a $6.9 billion pre-tax or $3.60 per share after-tax gain on the sale of Truist Insurance Holdings; a $10 million pre-tax or $0.01 per share after-tax expense due to the accelerated recognition of TIH equity-based compensation. So, on an adjusted basis we reported net income available to common shareholders of $1.2 billion or $0.91 per share. In addition to the items I just noted, we also had pre-tax restructuring charges totaling $96 million in the quarter, which negatively impacted adjusted EPS to common shareholders by $0.05 per share. Approximately $33 million of these pre-tax charges or $0.02 per share after tax negatively impacted net income from continuing operations and were primarily related to severance and real estate rationalization. The remaining restructuring charges were recorded in discontinued operations and were related to legal and other expenses associated with closing the divestiture of TIH. Total revenue adjusted for the losses on the available-for-sale investment securities increased 3% linked quarter due to a 4.5% increase in net interest income and relatively stable non-interest income. Adjusted expenses increased 2.6% linked quarter, but were down approximately 3% on a like quarter basis. Our CET1 ratio increased by 150 basis points linked quarter to 11.6%, primarily reflecting the sale of TIH and the balance sheet repositioning I discussed earlier. In addition, net charge-offs declined 6 basis points on a linked quarter basis and our non-performing loans remained relatively stable, both on a like and linked quarter basis. Moving to Slide 10. Average loans decreased 0.7% on a sequential basis, reflecting overall weaker client demand. Average commercial loans decreased $1.3 billion or 0.7%, primarily due to a 0.8% decline in C&I balances, driven at least in part by capital markets activity. In our consumer portfolio, average loans decreased $1 billion or 0.9% due to runoff in our residential mortgage portfolio and a decline in indirect auto. Other consumer balances, which include our specialty lending units, experienced modest growth and benefited from seasonal strength at Sheffield and increased demand at Service Finance. Overall, we expect client loan demand to remain relatively muted in the third quarter. Moving to deposit trends on Slide 11. Average deposits decreased 0.3% sequentially as growth in money market and savings was offset by declines in non-interest bearing time and brokered balances. Average non-interest bearing deposits decreased 1.2% and represented 28% of total deposits, which is unchanged compared to 28% during the first quarter of 2024. During the quarter, we experienced an increase in deposit costs, albeit at a slower pace than the first quarter. Specifically, total deposit costs increased 6 basis points sequentially, 2.09%, which resulted in a 1% increase in our cumulative total deposit beta to 39%. Interest-bearing deposit costs increased 7 basis points sequentially to 2.89%, which also resulted in a 1% increase to our cumulative total interest-bearing deposit beta cost, up 54%. Moving to net interest income and net interest margin on Slide 12. For the quarter, taxable equivalent net interest income increased 4.5% linked quarter or $155 million, primarily due to the strategic balance sheet repositioning completed during the quarter. Excluding the impact of this repositioning, our net interest income would have been relatively stable on a linked quarter basis, due primarily to our focus on average client deposits, which declined less than we expected. Reported net interest margin increased 14 basis points on a linked quarter basis to 3.03%. This was due primarily to the impact of the balance sheet repositioning. The partial quarter impact of the balance sheet repositioning helped to drive a 31 basis point improvement in the average yield on our investment securities portfolio to 2.77%. We estimate that our balance sheet remains positioned as relatively neutral from an interest-rate perspective comparable to Q1. Turning to non-interest income on Slide 13. Adjusted non-interest income, which excludes the losses associated with the balance sheet repositioning decreased $8 million or 0.6% relative to the first quarter. The linked quarter decrease was primarily attributable to lower investment banking and trading income, which declined $37 million from our strong first quarter performance due to lower M&A fees, equity originations, and trading income, partially offset by higher loan syndication fees. This decline was partially offset by higher mortgage banking and other income. Adjusted non-interest income increased 4.2% on a like-quarter basis as higher investment banking and trading and wealth management income were partially offset by lower service charge on deposit and other income. On a year-to-date basis, investment banking and trading income is up nearly 30% over the same period in 2023. Now, I'll cover non-interest expense on Slide 14. GAAP expenses of $3.1 billion increased $141 million linked quarter, primarily due to higher other expense-related to $150 million charitable donation, higher personnel costs reflecting merit increases, and higher professional fees. These increases were offset by lower restructuring charges and a reduction in FDIC expense due to a larger special assessment recorded in the first quarter. Excluding these items and the impact of intangible amortization, adjusted non-interest expense increased 2.6% sequentially due to higher personnel expense and professional fees. On a like-quarter basis, adjusted expenses declined $86 million or 3%, reflecting lower headcount and our continued expense discipline. Moving to Asset Quality on Slide 15. Asset Quality remained stable on both a like and linked quarter basis, reflecting our strong credit risk culture and proactive approach to quickly resolving problem loans. During the quarter, our net charge-off ratio decreased 6 basis points to 58 basis points. The decrease in net charge-offs for the quarter reflects lower consumer losses due to normal second quarter seasonal declines and certain derisking initiatives put in place in the second half of 2022. Our loan loss provision declined $49 million linked quarter, reflecting our stable credit performance, but it still exceeded net charge-offs for the quarter, resulting in a slight build to our overall loan loss allowance. Our ALLL ratio increased to 1.57%, up 1 basis point sequentially and 14 basis points year-over-year, which reflects ongoing credit normalization and stress in the office sector. Despite the normalization, non-performing loans remained relatively stable for the fifth consecutive quarter, while total delinquencies increased just 2 basis points on a linked quarter basis. Wholesale criticized loans declined $1 billion linked quarter to $10.8 billion. Included in our appendix is an updated -- is updated data on our office portfolio, which is virtually unchanged at 1.6% of total loans. However, we did increase our reserve on this portfolio from 9.3% to 9.7% during the quarter to reflect continued stress in the sector. Approximately 6.3% of our office portfolio is currently classified as non-performing compared with 5.5% at March 31st. Approximately, 90% of these loan balances are paying in accordance with the original terms of the loan. Notably, approximately 22% of our office portfolio is housed within our Community Banking and Wealth segments, where loan sizes tend to be more granular, guarantor support more prevalent, and overall loss is lower. We expect stress to remain in the office sector and believe that the size of our portfolio is manageable and well-reserved, but our position is to be very proactive in identifying and resolving issues in this portfolio. Turning now to capital on Slide 16. Truist CET1 ratio increased from 10.1% at March 31st to 11.6% at June 30. The increase was driven by the gain on the sale of Truist Insurance Holdings and organic capital generation, which was partially offset by the loss on the sale of certain available-for-sale investment securities during the quarter, which I addressed earlier. Importantly, the sale of TIH creates capacity for Truist to pursue growth opportunities in our Consumer and Wholesale Banking businesses and to return significant capital to shareholders, as evidenced by our share buyback program. Truist is well-positioned to weather a wide variety of economic scenarios, which was evident in our most recent CCAR stress-test results released in late June. Specifically, Truist had the second-lowest C&I loan loss rate and the third-lowest CET1 erosion rate versus our peers. Our stress capital buffer will improve by 10 basis points to 2.8%, effective October 1st. At June 30, our CET1 ratio was 430 basis points higher than our new regulatory minimum of 7.3%, leaving us well-positioned to both grow our balance sheet and return capital to shareholders. Our increased level of capital accelerates our ability to meet increasing standards for capital and liquidity in the industry as our estimated CET1 capital ratio under proposed Basel III endgame rules improved 20 basis points to 9.1% at June 30, which is 180 basis points above our new regulatory minimum. And now, I will review updated guidance -- our updated guidance on Slide 17. Looking into the third quarter of 2024, we expect revenue to increase 1% to 2% from second quarter 2024 adjusted revenue of $5 billion. We expect net interest income to increase 2% to 3% in the third quarter, primarily driven by a full quarter impact of the balance sheet repositioning completed on May 6. We expect non-interest income to remain relatively stable on a linked quarter basis. Adjusted expenses of $2.8 billion in the second quarter are expected to increase by 3% in the third quarter due to higher professional fees, software costs, and higher marketing costs. For the full year 2024, we previously expected revenues to be down 0.5% to 1.5%. We now expect total revenues to decline by approximately 0.5% to 1% in 2024. Our updated outlook is based on slightly better client deposit balance performance, partially offset by lower client loan demand and our updated view of interest rates, which now assumes just one reduction in the Federal Funds rate in November of this year. Consistent with our previous expense outlook, we expect full year 2024 adjusted expenses to remain approximately flat over 2023 adjusted expenses of $11.4 billion. In terms of Asset Quality, we continue to expect net charge-offs of about 65 basis points in 2024. As Bill previously mentioned, we are targeting approximately $500 million of share repurchases per quarter for the remainder of the year as part of our share repurchase authorization announced in late June. Finally, we expect our effective tax-rate to approximate 16% or 19% on a taxable equivalent basis in both the third and fourth quarters of 2024. Now, I'll hand it back to Bill for some final remarks. William Rogers : Great. Thanks, Mike. So our top priorities for 2024 are unchanged. They include growing and deepening relationships with core clients, maintaining our expense discipline, returning capital to our shareholders via share buybacks and our common strong dividend, and enhancing our digital experience through T3, all while maintaining and strengthening strong risk controls and asset quality metrics. We made demonstrable progress on these priorities during the quarter, and I'm really proud of the results our teammates delivered, which included solid underlying earnings, improved momentum, and sound asset quality. All this was accomplished while also completing the divestiture of Truist Insurance Holdings and repositioning our balance sheet during the quarter. These actions created significant capital capacity to grow our Consumer and Wholesale businesses and return capital to shareholders via our strong common dividend and our recently announced repurchase authorization of up to $5 billion of our common stock. In addition, our significantly stronger balance sheet is well-positioned to weather an even wider range of economic and interest-rate environments. Although the balance sheet repositioning completed during the quarter is expected to replace TIH's earnings in the near term, we recognize that our increased level of capital will result in near-term dilution to our return on average tangible common equity ratio. As I've said previously, our starting point for our ROTCE is exactly that, it's a starting point. We're going to move with pace to deploy our capital, improve our returns, but we're not going to be in a rush to leverage capital to meet short-term expectations that do not have long term positive impact on our company, clients, and shareholders. We have a clear understanding of not only where we want to win, but where we want to win profitably. We'll look to share more of our plan with you as we progress through the remainder of this year. I can say that I'm encouraged that much of the profitability improvement potential we are working towards is centered on further deepening of existing client relationships in verticals and product lines that already exist at Truist. We have great confidence in our ability to further penetrate our existing client base, grow our core banking business, and help new and existing clients achieve financial success by delivering our commercial, consumer, payments, investment banking, and wealth platform, given the ongoing investments through our existing footprint in specialty areas. In wholesale, we've invested in our investment banking and trading platform over the last several years. We've also hired experienced bankers in key industry verticals and products. These investments have resulted in greater mind share with our clients across many industry verticals and an increase in the number of lead roles across several product lines. Most recently, we've invested heavily in our Payments business and have made key leadership additions as this is an area where we see significant opportunity for growth over time, not only with new clients, but also within our existing client base. We have a clear focus, high expectations, and a compelling teammate value proposition. Many of our teammates have risen to this new challenge and we have very successfully hired additional strong talent in wholesale, primarily from larger institutions who have experience and are thriving in our purpose-driven high-performance culture. We plan to continue adding talent in wholesale with a specific focus on further building out our middle-market commercial lending segment, which represents one of the largest growth opportunities within our regional business. We will primarily focus on industries that support existing corporate investment banking coverage and expertise. We're making these investments, while also adhering to our expense discipline, which is helping fund investments in technology to improve the client experience and also to improve risk management. In consumer, I'm really encouraged with our momentum. Our internal client satisfaction scores continue to improve as evidenced by increased net-new checking account production, increased primacy, and lower attrition rates. Net-new checking account production was once again positive in the second quarter as we added 38,000 new consumer and business accounts. Importantly, we're also seeing year-over-year improvement in account attrition rates and increased primacy and usage within new account openings. As I previously mentioned, we added 180,000 new accounts during the quarter, including nearly 70,000 new to bank clients through our digital channels, which represented a 17% increase. In addition to an increase in account openings, we're also seeing improvement in the funding of our digital account openings with balances up 60% over the second quarter of last year. In consumer and small business lending, we've been consistently adding new small business lenders across our footprint. In the second quarter, small business applications increased 15% linked quarter, resulting in a 10% increase in our pipeline given us confidence that average consumer balance says excluding runoff in residential mortgages will stabilize in the third quarter. In conclusion, I'm pleased with the progress we've made as a company at the midpoint of this year, but we acknowledge there's more work to do as we strive to produce better results in the future. We have tremendous momentum within our company. We have momentum with our clients and we've got great momentum with our teammates. We have an incredible franchise, energized, purposeful teammates, and specialized capabilities that our clients value. We think the ability to grow our core banking business, our profitability, and return significant amounts of capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the next several years is a unique differentiating factor for Truist. I am optimistic about our future. I look-forward to operating our company from our increased position of financial strength. And finally, I'd be remiss if I didn't thank all of our incredible teammates and our great leaders for their incredible purposeful focus and productivity and moving our company forward. So Brad, with that, let me hand it over back over to you for Q&A. Brad Milsaps : Thank you, Bill. Betsy, at this time, will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session. As you do that, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary question and one follow-up in order that we may accommodate as many of you as possible today. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Ryan Nash : Hey, good morning, Bill. Good morning, Mike. William Rogers : Good morning. Ryan Nash : And maybe to start off with NII, it feels post-restructuring, we've bottomed now and you should get a step up next quarter, but can you maybe just talk about the drivers of sequential NII growth over the next few quarters? Do you expect margin improvement? And then how do you think about where the margin could be headed over the medium-term? Thanks. And I have a follow-up Mike Maguire : Hey, good morning, Ryan. We mentioned in our comments that we do expect the NII to improve next quarter by 2% to 3%, really, the bulk of that is driven by just the full quarter impact of the repositioning that we completed back in May. We continue to expect there to be some pressure on client deposit balances as well as loan balances, so maybe a touch conservative there. We did have some nice, just to say it, just some nice outperformance in the second quarter on client deposit balances, which really helped stabilize that core NII ex the bonds. But that's really sort of the story for Q2. And I think Q4, just looking out a little further, if you think about kind of rest of year trajectory, kind of more of the same, right? I mean, we mentioned we've got a November cut in. We think that helps a touch, but that is the first cut and it's pretty late. So we've got pretty modest expectations around the impact there. And I think for us, really what will stimulate some improvement on the NII side will just be some of the core balances. So getting client loan demand increased, getting -- which hopefully will generate balances as well, and I'll just mention this, I mean we're very focused around the company, pick your segment or [LOB] (ph), everybody in the company is very focused on realizing that growth opportunity once it presents itself. It's just -- and you've heard this from I think others this week and last week, there just has really not been a lot of client activity. Ryan Nash : Got it. Maybe this one for Mike or Bill. As a follow-up to Mike's comments. So it looks like loan balances are getting closer to level-off, but Mike, you highlighted 3Q, you're expecting it to be muted and my interpretation was that it doesn't sound like you're expecting a lot of growth in the fourth quarter. So maybe just flush those expectations a little further, Bill, when do you expect it to turn positive? What do you think the drivers are? And I guess, given the strength of your footprint, do you actually expect Truist to begin to outperform peers on growth at some point? Thank you. William Rogers : Yes, let me -- I'll start with the second part of that first and the answer to that is yes. But it has to have growth. We've got to sort of see that coming. Clients are on the sidelines, I mean, we can feel that in our conversations. Our conversations are increasingly a lot more strategic. So I feel like we actually even know more about what our clients are thinking, but they're a bit on the sidelines. Our production was up, so we saw production being up. It was really probably best in consumer, where it was up a little more significantly. Utilization is just absolutely flat but paydowns were also up. So in our clients that aren't towards the larger side, they were accessing the capital markets, and the good news is, I mean, you see that in our investment banking, particularly in our DCM results, I mean we're -- our capture rate on that is really, really high, so we sort of see the other part of that. Despite the pipelines being up, production being up, I just want to be careful, Ryan, about sort of like putting a stake in the ground and saying, okay, it's going to return on ex. I mean, take this weekend, I mean there's a lot of uncertainty out there in the world and in the market. So while clients have capacity, we're coiled spring, ready to go, positioned better than anybody. I think we just want to be realistic about when and if that -- well, not if, but when that's going to come back and when it's going to come back with some strength. And when it does, I think to your latter part of your question, we're in the best markets and I think we should disproportionately grow faster. Ryan Nash : Thanks for all the color, Bill. William Rogers : Yes. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Thanks. I guess as a follow-up to that line of thought, Bill, you mentioned that you'd be methodical and kind of not getting ahead of yourself to just use near-term. So I'm just wondering if you can kind of just remind us again, now that we've got the buyback out there, now that the restructuring is done, you just gave more color on the loan growth, talk about prioritization, what would lead you to do kind of one more than the other in terms of moving the ball of all things excess capital-related and then how that kind of leads into your pacing choices on the buyback specifically? Thanks. William Rogers : Yes, Ken, great question. And obviously, something that's important and we're going to be calibrating, priority one, two, and three is growing our business. I mean, we think we've got a great franchise, a great market. We're really well-positioned. We've invested in talent, we've invested in capabilities, so I think we've got the capacity and the capability to grow in our core business. So that is absolutely going to be the primary focus. We raised capital in the most efficient way possible. You just couldn't have raised it more efficiently than how we raised capital and we want to make sure that we deploy that also in the most efficient way possible long-term, long-term benefit for our shareholders. So I think we've put together a compelling return perspective with what Mike outlined. We're going to do about $500 million a quarter for the next couple of quarters, I would presume we'd enter next year in sort of the same kind of -- same kind of pace, but remember, that's also on top of we've got a really strong dividend. So in terms of total dollars returned to shareholders over the next six months, I mean, we have a really compelling value proposition. So we're going to calibrate that as we go along. We don't want to over-index on one and lose this incredible capital advantage we have for growth. Ken Usdin : Okay. Got it. And then secondly, as you enjoy this incremental NII benefit, it does seem like in the second half, certainly in the third quarter, expenses look to be increasing, can you give us also a little bit of context in terms of how you're calibrating the new better revenue outlook to making those investments and the pacing just flattish -- flat is a tough like overall guide to see through, but kind of at flat, it implies that third quarter and in fourth quarter expenses are still -- are going higher, just wondering if you could provide a little context underneath that about your pacing of your investment spending and to the areas you mentioned earlier. Thanks. Mike Maguire : Hey, Ken, it's Mike. Maybe take a swing at that one. No, you're right. I mean, look, we think we do see growth in the third quarter on the expense side, I think that's still on a like basis, close to flat, maybe even a touch better, and I think that implies, if you think about flat, maybe a touch of growth in the fourth as well. Look, I mean, the first half of the year, we were very focused on cost discipline and frankly following through on our commitment around flat. That's still important to us. But as we've sort of gotten to the midway mark, it's -- there have been certain projects, whether it be some marketing spend sort of you name it, nits and nats that perhaps were delayed and that drove some of the beat maybe even this quarter and even in last quarter, and so some of that stuff just makes a ton of sense. And as we really shift our mindset, and you heard Bill talk a little bit about it in his prepared remarks around some of the hiring we're doing in middle-market lending as an example, around our Payments business, some calibrating of marketing spend, et cetera, these are all factors that are driving our outlook for the second half, and so, look, we feel -- and we've said this is really since last fall, we are very, very confident and committed to being sort of 0.0 or better on expenses this year. William Rogers : Yes, and Ken, just to add to that, I mean, when we undertook this approach in the fall of last year, I mean, we were always really clear this was going to include investments and the timing of those sort of, as Mike pointed out, come quarter-to-quarter. And we're seeing the benefit of that. I mean, the investments we made in payments, investment made in talent, so the expense guidance was always coincident with that. I'll just say because I think it's really important, the discipline that we have in the company around both of those is significantly increased. So we sort of know that the next dollar to invest with a lot of confidence and we also have just incredibly strong discipline around the expense side and where the opportunities are. So I think we've got the right balance here. And as Mike said, wholly committed to a flat or better expense proposition for the remainder of this year. Ken Usdin : Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Scott Siefers : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Mike, I know you suggested you all are relatively neutral to rate moves. I think still kind of for better or worse, a lot of investors consider Truist is among the -- kind of closer to the liability-sensitive side of the equation. In that vein, you anticipate just one rate cut in the remainder of the year, how would another one or two affect that NII guidance? Obviously, timing would be a factor, but just curious on your overall thoughts. Mike Maguire : Yes, good morning, Scott. Yes, so we do have the one cut in November. If we got one earlier, call it, I think the curve today has a September cut and maybe December and maybe even a touch more than that, that would be a help for us. We -- look, we -- our baseline path does show benefit from down rates. I think the question and I brought it up in sort of my earlier question, I think that Ryan asked, that first cut given how high we are and how late we expected, we're just trying to be reasonable and thinking about the benefit we'll get there. But I think you're right, I think if we got one earlier and then maybe perhaps a second, that would be a good guy. I will say this, I think just given where we are in terms of how high we are and how long we've been here and some of the client behavior that we're able to observe, I think the more impactful catalyst will be, again, getting some of that loan demand and balanced growth and client deposit growth as well. So would take it all. Scott Siefers : Perfect. Okay, good. Thank you. And then maybe switching gears just a second, I was hoping you might be able to address the investment banking line, down a little in the quarter, but I'd say, you at least -- I see you're still well above a recent run rate, so still a very strong number. Maybe if you could touch to or speak to sort of overall thoughts on the outlook and then maybe a thought on what you might consider sort of a sustainable base of revenues for you all. William Rogers : Yes, I mean we're -- the Investment Banking business is always going to be a little quarter-to-quarter variation. In the first quarter, we had one of the highest M&A fees in our company's history, so that sort of changed -- impacted that a bit. But most importantly, we feel really good about the momentum. So if you look at sort of our relevance, I mean, we're gaining share in virtually every category, the things that we're doing in terms of active book-runner and left lead transactions in ECM, half of our fees were being from active book-runner, dramatic change from where we've been in the past, lots of left leads transactions in there and again increased market share. And most importantly, just really good relevance. So back to sort of the comment about talent and comment about adding talent and upgrading our toolkits, our commercial bankers' focus and understanding and -- of our capabilities is just increasing exponentially. So our dialogue, as I mentioned with our clients is really strong. It's all strategic dialogue versus product dialogue, which is really good. And I think for the balance of the year, I mean, I think this is the kind of momentum we ought to be able to continue investment banking, so I think we feel good about that. Scott Siefers : Perfect. All right. Bill, Mike, thank you, guys, very much. Operator : The next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Just putting everything that you said together, Mike, maybe I'll address this one to you. Your net interest income was better than consensus, both mostly on the net interest margin. You mentioned that the impact of the margin from balance sheet restructuring is a partial one. If I look at the line items on non-interest income, you also be consensus there for the quarter in terms of the core items and consensus is at down, one, which is at the low end of your revenue range. I guess, like what are we missing? And I heard your response to Ryan's question about you expect balances to continue to come down in both the loan on deposit side, but if your starting point on net interest margin is higher than consensus and then you have a little bit more pull-through -- a month pull-through in the third quarter and your neutral to rates in September will help, I guess, are you being very conservative on what you could accomplish in the second half of the year because I get the conservatism from a business standpoint, but from a rate standpoint, it feels like you guys are in good shape to maybe do a little bit better. Mike Maguire : Yes, Erika, I appreciate the question. I mean -- look, I think there was a beat on balances in the second quarter, especially if you look at it on an average basis, and so our rate paid was a touch better than we thought, and so you're right, starting position better than where we sort of would have expected to be in April. I think the pressures that we expected in the second quarter, we still believe will persist in the third, especially in terms of balances and rate paid. Another piece of this is that while we did get some benefit on our net interest margin from the bonds like recouponing, some of the benefit as well is just on a smaller balance sheet. So we did -- for example, we paid down some wholesale liabilities late in the second that will come through in the third on an average basis. So you'll see more net interest margin improvement, but it will be on a more efficient smaller balance sheet. On rates, I don't want to call the ball on conservative -- non-conservative, I think we're cautious on what benefit we'll get on the first cut or two. We've thought about it a lot, done a lot of work and analysis. You look at sort of historically, over the last, call it, 30 years, the down cycles and the betas have been slow, right? So I think that's in our thinking too for the rest of the year. And look, I've said this a couple of times. I think for us, the thing -- we're like feel fine about the guidance we gave, I think what would really be upside for us would be a little bit of pull-through on more client activity and the ability to generate more loan volume and with that will come deposits. You get that and maybe you get Scott's extra cut in early and that feels good. I mean the hurts are obviously the cut we've got, no cuts perhaps, maybe that's not such a bad guy, and then just the pressure that we've been seeing on balances, both deposits and loans. Erika Najarian : Got it. And my second question is for Bill on capital and returns. And maybe I'm just reading too much in the tea leaves because investors are very curious. The authorization for the $5 billion is through 2026. You said during your prepared remarks, tell me if I'm being too ticky-tacky, but you said initially target $5 billion for the remainder of the year, and I guess investors are wondering about timing and I know someone had already asked, Ken has already asked about capital priorities, but is this -- what's the timing in terms of that fulfilling that $5 billion authority? And as I think about returns, I know you'll probably tell us more during fall conference season, but initially, this franchise together with TIH had an ROTCE potential in the low 20s, with TIH out, could you still achieve like a high-teens ROTCE? And I'm sure you will get more details during fall conference season. William Rogers : Yes, Erika, just to correct one thing, we said some of a billion through the remainder of this year and we'll sort of start the next year, and the reason to put the authorization of up to and make it through 2026 is just to give us that kind of flexibility in terms of how we think about that. So we're going to calibrate that against our growth opportunities and where we see an ability to invest in our franchise and we're going to be disciplined about it. So -- and then as I mentioned earlier, remember, this is with a really strong dividend as well. So I think you can't talk about one without talking about the other in terms of total return to shareholders. So I think our unique capability to have a really good return to shareholders over the certainly near-term and medium-term from the dividend buyback is actually quite significant. And then you put on top of that our ability to earn and earn profitably and grow our business. So I think that's -- we're trying to look at all of this in the big mix. As it relates to ROTCE specifically, I mean the past numbers are the past numbers, we sort of have to start from the business model that we have now. Again, we're going to give a little more guidance on that with a little more specificity as we get towards the end of the year, as you mentioned. I think we'll have a little more knowledge as to sort of overall capital requirements. And while Basel may not be complete, I think we might have a better picture of where we might be and what the sort of CET1 base might be that we'd operate from and think about how to put all those mixes together as it relates to growth as well. So irrespective of the target itself, the growth to the target, I think is a really compelling proposition for Truist. Erika Najarian : Okay, Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Mike Maguire : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : A bit of a follow-up on last question with Erika regarding capital, when I put together the $500 million that you're looking for in the buybacks and the dividend, it looks like you're -- for the most part returning earnings -- quarterly earnings to investors at least for the rest of this year and RWA doesn't change, that means you've got a CET1 stable where it is today. I know you're probably not -- you didn't put a target CET1 out. I'm going to guess you're going to highlight that we need the capital rules to put that out there. But is that a fair conclusion that 11.6% is essentially what we should anticipate as we roll through the rest of this year? Mike Maguire : Yes, Betsy, I think that's roughed out, you could see us sort of sliding sideways for a while for the reasons you mentioned, you're right. I mean you take the $500 million buyback and, call it, $700 million or so dividend, you're approximately at -- this is rough earnings, right? And I think you're right, we don't expect significant ROA improvement or decline over the period. I'll just say this, I mean -- and you mentioned sort of CET1 target, Bill referred to it as well, I think a couple of things just to think about there. One, we like operating with a higher level of capital in today's world, one. It affords us the right, we think strength and resiliency and ability to sort of react to the world. Importantly, we've got a growth agenda. We're focused on prosecuting that's company-wide. You feel that with any -- especially frontline, but really across the whole company, and then Bill mentioned sort of the capability to return capital and that can come in various forms. But yes, I think modeling us somewhat flat short-term. But again, we -- our expectation is that we'll begin to grow RWAs next year and so that's how we're thinking about it. Betsy Graseck : Right. And then on the pay downs that you experienced in the C&I book, how much of that did you capture in the Capital Markets business? In other words, if folks are terming out and paying down C&I, is that -- are we seeing a majority recaptured in the fee line? Thanks. William Rogers : Yes. It's hard to do that calculation sort of perfectly and we spend a lot of time thinking about it, but if you sort of look at the overall line, this was one of our best DCM quarters in a really long time. So our capture rate is really high. It's hard to put an exact percentage on that because there are puts and takes, and would you have got it otherwise and was it related to this, that, or the other? But it's really high and it's reflected in our overall DCM growth. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Thanks so much. Appreciate it. William Rogers : Yes. Operator : The next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead. John Pancari : Good morning. What it seems like could just touch on credit a little bit. I know you added modestly to the loan loss reserve and looks like much of that was on the office side. I wanted to get your thoughts there in terms of the -- what you're seeing right now in terms of credit progression. What are the areas that you're seeing some weakening? You had some pressure on delinquencies and non-accruals? And could that justify incremental modest additions to the reserve from here, or could you see it stable or even some releases from this point? Thanks. Clarke Starnes : Hey, John, this is Clarke. As Mike and Bill said, we were very pleased with the overall asset quality for the quarter and we generally had stable delinquencies. We had flat NPLs and our losses were a touch lower, particularly in this consumer area. So we still see in the consumer side, the normalization that's occurring due to higher rates, inflation, and the stimulus burndown, particularly for the lower end consumer. So we've been a little careful there even in this quarter's reserve. We added a little bit for those lower income consumer finance areas. And then you're right, on the CRE side and the office exposure, we still just want to make sure we're addressing the uncertainty there. On the wholesale C&I side, we actually had, as Bill said, lower watch list, and even though we're monitoring areas like the leverage book, consumer discretionary, senior care, transportation, some of those more rate-sensitive areas, we've not had any big sector issues to date, it's been more episodic. So when we think about our reserves, we feel really good about the adequacy of where we are today and it reflects what we know today. So unless there's a substantial change in the economic outlook or that level of uncertainty in areas of stress like CRE office would emerge higher, we wouldn't expect our reserve levels for the remainder of 2024 to be relatively stable. John Pancari : Okay, great. Thanks for that clarity. And then separately on the on the fee side, just -- I know you mentioned relatively stable in terms of the non-interest income outlook for the third quarter, maybe can you talk about fourth quarter a little bit, how we should think about the progression into fourth quarter and into 2025? And then separately, as part of that, on the investment banking side, you made some pretty solid talent acquisition and you've cited the intent that you're investing there and the progress you've made, can you maybe just talk to us about, is the build-out ongoing? Is there a focused effort to upscale the investment banking business even more in terms of the reach and breadth of the business and maybe what are the long-term revenue contribution from that business that you anticipate? William Rogers : Yes, maybe I'll start with the latter, Mike, and then I'll turn it over to you for the performance if that's okay. So the build-out of Investment Banking business has been decades plus, so this isn't sort of a new thing, and so it has been consistent. I think the way you described it is exactly right. We'll continue to build where we have relevance, where we have opportunity, and so we can be competitive and win in our markets. I think the part that gets missed though is the investment we're making around the Investment Banking business. So this is the investment that we're making with our commercial teams and our middle-market teams and expanding their knowledge and capability to talk to clients about the things that are available to them. And so think about the amount of clients in our commercial business that are now private equity-owned and our capability to be relevant in those discussions and help them along that flight path. So investment is not just in the business itself, but it's in everything that surrounds the business and in support of. We like the pace that we're growing and we think we've had a really good CAGR. If you sort of go back over time and look at the CAGR of that business, you'd sort of say that's a really good growth pattern. Importantly, we're doing it profitably, which is also important. So we have a really good efficiency of that business certainly on a on a relative basis, and we want to keep all of those in check. I mean, we don't want to grow faster than the market. We want to grow coincident with the opportunity that we have within our markets. We want to do it profitably and we want to do it sustainably. So we want to have a little less variability relative to that business. So it's tied to more of our core client capability than the vagaries of a particular market. And Mike, there was a... Mike Maguire : Yes, John, I think you asked just about the trajectory for the second half for fees, I think some -- you don't know to -- put some puts and takes, our outlook is relatively stable really for the second half, so call it, stable, stable. William Rogers : And the upside to that is [Multiple Speakers] Yes, maybe upside is business is better. We're trying to take an approach with what we know right now. John Pancari : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hey, not a new question, but it goes back to your efficiency ratio and your expense guide and you mentioned higher in the third quarter, and maybe any preview for next year or how you're thinking about that? And that's partly in the context, there's a Bloomberg story out saying that 11 of the 22 large banks fall short on operational risk according to the OCC. Now that's not confirmed by the OCC. There's no specific companies given and I know you're not allowed to say what your regulatory ratings are, but if you or any other bank did have a deficient operational risk rating, what would that mean? Would it mean -- I don't know what would that mean? Are you able to say if you had ever been in that position in the past five years? I know you had some operational issues that you work through. And then also note, Bill, that your purpose is being open every day for your clients and employees and your communities, so I know you put that as a very high priority. So what degree has that hurt the efficiency in the past few years and to what degree could that still be a drag on efficiency going ahead? Thanks. William Rogers : Yes, Mike, you asked and answered part of your question as it relates to what will comment on and not comment on. But look, I've said very consistently actually since the day Truist was formed, is the size and complexity of our organization, we're going to invest in our risk framework. We're going to invest in a durable risk framework, so we can stay competitive, we can stay appropriate with our regulators and that's always been part of this expense profile. So I think even in today's prepared remarks, I mean, I'm always consistent with that, and I think everybody has got to stay in that mode. Post of March of last year, irrespective of anybody's ratings, there was just increased focus on creating a durable risk profile. So we're going to continue to be in that mode. I can't see that changing short-term, medium-term, or long-term. Are there peaks and valleys in that as you go up? Yes, does it increase proportionately? Absolutely. I mean, I just think that's the price of being in our business and also the importance of creating a durable sustainable risk framework for a company of our size and the company of our opportunity. Mike Mayo : Well, the $20 billion market cap question relates to the last part of your answer is for a company of our size, so I'm just wondering, and it's an ongoing wonder, to what degree does that investment in the risk framework hurt Truist disproportionately versus banks larger than your size and how has that changed? William Rogers : Yes. I mean there are efficient frontiers is the way, Mike, that I like to talk about it. They're efficient frontiers and where you are on the efficient frontier relative to that. But today, I feel like we're in a good place. So we're in a good place in terms of the investments that we need and should make relative to our company our size and our ability to return and have an efficient company relative to that. So I think we're at a good place. But that efficient frontier moves, so you always have to be flexible and think about that in the context of where it moves and we're conscious of that. So today, I feel like we're in a good place. By the way, we merged our companies because we thought we were at a different place and that that was going to be more complex and we needed to have a company of the size and scale sort of seeing -- I mean, we didn't project March of last year in fairness, but understanding that the complexity and the durability and the investments needed to create that kind of risk platform was going to be needed. So that efficient frontier, I think we're in a good place on it, but it does move. Mike Mayo : And Last short follow-up. The definition of good place as it relates to 2025, I know you usually don't give guidance for a few quarters from now, but other banks have mentioned record NII, positive operating leverage, lower expenses next year, can you give us a sneak peak of good place as it relates to 2025 financials? William Rogers : Yes. I mean our sneak peek is the momentum we're creating right now. So that's the sneak peek and we want to continue to do that. Mike, you and I've talked about this. I mean, we have a strong focus on positive operating leverage. So all of our businesses have plans that are focused on positive operating leverage, that's what they try to build over time. The controllable -- more controllable factor over that is on the expense side right now, and I'm really pleased with the progress we're making. And I expect to continue to have that kind of discipline going forward. Those expenses will better reflect the revenue opportunity that we see in next year. So be assured that we've got to focus on creating that, but also be confident that we're building momentum. And I think this quarter is good evidence of that and our guidance for the rest of the year is good evidence of that. Mike Mayo : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hey, good morning. Just a quick follow-up, Bill, on your response to Mike's question. As we think about -- I just want to make sure we understand this correctly, as we think about next year, ex any sort of revenue momentum taking sort of the top line higher, should we expect expenses like the Street is expecting about $2.9 billion to $3 billion per quarter in expense run-rate continuing in 2025? Is that fair to assume all else equal, absent sort of revenue growth? William Rogers : Yes, thanks. I'm not going to give expense guidance for next year. Just to say, confidence that we'll be focused on positive operating leverage, confidence that we've got great expense discipline, and expenses will more parallel the revenue opportunity. So if we see the investments that we're making, better growth opportunities in our markets, we're going to take advantage of that. And if that requires a requisite -- expense increase, then we'll do that, but that will all be in the appropriate context of focus on positive operating leverage, an efficient company that has high returns. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And just one quick follow-up, maybe if you could remind us post sort of the acquisition integration where we stand in terms of any big tech upgrades coming on the deposit or lending platforms as we think about the next year or two? Thanks. William Rogers : Yes. I mean, all that's been factored into the discussions that we have. I mean, our ability -- this year, particularly to invest a lot in the payment side, is all predicated on the existing platforms that we have. The advent of the use of APIs have been really, really great opportunities to continue to invest. We had huge investments in our lending portfolios as part of the merger. So there's no like one big stair step sequenced investment, these are continuous investments in our platform and capabilities over time. Ebrahim Poonawala : And is it safe to assume that from a tech platform standpoint, Truist is not at a disadvantage relative to peers who probably have not done deals and just been working on -- there's an impression out there that you have a lot more sort of heavy-lifting to do there that's put you back, sounds like that's not the case, but just wanted to confirm. William Rogers : Well, the momentum we've seen in the last several quarters, the impression from our clients is that we have a really good platform. So our acquisition of clients, our performance metrics, client satisfaction scores, all the things that we look in terms of how do clients think about us is real positive and continuing. Ebrahim Poonawala : Excellent. Thank you, Bill. Operator : We will take our last question today from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. You kind of implied the loans and deposit balances might be down a little bit again in 3Q, if I heard that correctly, and they were down a little bit in 2Q here, just thoughts on where they bottom. And I understand like when we're looking at industry data where there's less than 1% loan growth, like we're talking about really small numbers, but it seems like you're still kind of lagging the H8 data a little bit and it's understandable given how much has been going on in the company. You talked about spending more in marketing and hiring people, but just thoughts on kind of where those level out and you start tracking the H.8 data a little bit more. Thanks. Mike Maguire : Hey, Matt, thanks for the question. Maybe just taking loans first. We were hopeful we'll see some relief. We were down a little less than 1% this quarter average. In the third quarter, I think, again, base case, probably expected to be down, maybe not quite as much. We'd love to see that be different, but that's sort of what we're thinking about. And then hopefully kind of stable from there. Same on deposits -- or actually deposits a little lower perhaps in the third. We mentioned that we felt like we had some outperformance in the second quarter. We did late in the quarter, just like a lot of others, some of the just sort of seasonality and tax payments. We saw balances a little lower at the end of the quarter. That's not unusual. So we probably expect a little bit of pressure in the third quarter as well, but again, even that stabilizing in the fourth. So think down a touch in the third for both and then hopefully stable in the fourth-ish. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay, that's helpful. And then just as you think about, call it, restarting kind of the loan deposit engine internally, you did allude to the marketing and hiring people, but what's like the process of just getting the message out to kind of existing employees like you got all this capital, you got all this liquidity, like you could be front-footed, and I know it takes time to kind of flip the switch, again, especially in an environment where there's still little kind of growth out there, but just touch on a couple of things you're doing to drive that. William Rogers : Yes, sure. Rest assured that our teammates are highly focused, and there are places that we can dial more specifically and you sort of seen it. Our consumer production was up 37% over a linked-quarter, premier banking lending numbers sort of similar per branch production, those type things, so the places that we can dial in a little bit. And then on the wholesale side, it's just a lot about training, it's a lot about hiring, it's a lot about market opportunity, it's a lot about dialogue with clients, so we look at all the pitches kind of approach and we're seeing really good activity. But our teammates are on offense and they make -- let there be no confusion. I mean, our teammates are on offense. They are not in a defensive position. Trust me, the shift for them happened quite quickly. There was a -- you could hear it and feel it in terms of momentum. People are attracted to come work for our franchise for some of the same reasons as we have the capital and capability to invest in the future. So rest assured that -- your point is right, I mean, the battleship, it's hard to turn, but in terms of its direction, clear direction, clear communication, and clear focus from our teams. Matt O\u2019Connor: Thank you. William Rogers : Thanks, Matt. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brad Milsaps for any closing remarks. Brad Milsaps : Okay. Thank you. That completes our earnings call. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team. Thank you for your interest in Truist, and we hope you have a great day. Betsy, you now may disconnect the call. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Brad Milsaps. Brad Milsaps : Thank you, Betsy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist's third quarter 2024 earnings call. With us today are our Chairman and CEO, Bill Rogers; our CFO, Mike Maguire; our Vice Chair and Chief Risk Officer, Clarke Starnes; as well as other members of Truist's senior management team. During this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's third quarter results, share their perspectives on current business conditions and provide an updated outlook for 2024. The accompanying presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the Truist investor relations website at ir.truist.com. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slides 2 and 3 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix for appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. With that, I will turn it over to Bill. Bill Rogers : Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. Before we discuss the third quarter's results, I'd like to begin with purpose on Slide 4. As you all know, Truist is a purpose-driven company. We're dedicated to inspiring and building better lives and communities. It's the foundation for everything we do and the belief in this mission has never been more important given the extraordinary start to the fourth quarter with two devastating hurricanes. In the days since these storms cut a path through the Southeast, Truist's humanitarian aid team and hundreds of teammate volunteers have been out and forced to help our communities. I spent time in recent days with teammates in some of the hardest hit areas. These teammates are doing just incredible heroic work, helping their neighbors, distributing critical supplies and making sure Truist facilities were open to serve our clients even as their own lives have been upended. In addition to contributions from the foundation, we've set up several sites where we've distributed supplies. We've also deployed mobile services for basic needs like showers and laundering facilities as well as mobile branches, ATMs and generators to serve clients in areas without power. This recovery is going to take time, and we're going to play a significant role in helping these communities recover and rebuild in the days, weeks, months and even years to come. They can count on Truist. Okay. Let's turn to discussing our third quarter results on Slide 5. We've made demonstrable progress on our strategic priorities during the quarter, as I'm proud of the results our teammates delivered, which included solid underlying earnings, improved momentum and sound asset quality metrics. On a GAAP basis, we reported net income available to common shareholders of $1.3 billion or $0.99 a share, adjusted EPS was $0.97 per share, which excluded a few small discrete items that Mike will discuss later in the call. As you can see on the slide, our solid performance was defined by several key themes. First, we grew adjusted revenue 2.4% on a linked-quarter basis due to another strong quarter of investment banking and trading income and a full quarter's impact on the balance sheet repositioning we completed during the second quarter. Second, our results show our continued expense discipline and focus on managing cost. As a result of these efforts, our efficiency ratio improved on both a linked and like-quarter basis. Adjusted expenses increased by less than 1% linked-quarter and declined for the third consecutive quarter on a year-over-year basis. Expenses are now projected to decline sin 2024 compared to 2023, which is an improvement from our original commitment to keep expenses flat for the year. Non-performing loans remained relatively stable while net charge-offs were better than our expectations. We did record a $25 million loan loss provision during the quarter specifically related to Hurricane Helene, which Mike will discuss in more detail later. We also returned $1.2 billion worth of capital to our shareholders through our common dividend and repurchase of $500 million worth of common stock as part of the $5 billion repurchase plan our Board approved in late July -- I mean, late June, excuse me. We anticipate repurchasing another $500 million of our common stock in the fourth quarter. Our CET1 capital ratio remained relatively stable, leaving us well-positioned to grow our balance sheet and to continue to return significant amount of capital to shareholders. Finally, we continue to actively pursue growth opportunities in our core consumer and small business and wholesale banking businesses. Although average loans declined during the quarter, I'm encouraged by the underlying momentum in terms of increased loan production, greater wallet share within certain businesses and the talent we're attracting to our company, all while continuing to maintain our expense discipline and investing in important areas like technology and our risk infrastructure. Maintaining this momentum and continuing to execute against our strategic growth priorities will be key to reaching our mid-teens medium-term ROATCE target, which we also announced during the quarter. Before I hand the call over to Mike to discuss the quarterly results, I want to spend a little time reviewing the positive momentum we're seeing within business segments and within our digital initiatives on Slides 6 and 7. In Consumer and Small Business Banking, I'm encouraged by the momentum as we experienced an increase in loan production in key focus areas within our lending portfolio, and we continue to acquire new clients and households through both digital and traditional channels. Average consumer loan balance remained relatively stable linked-quarter as growth in other consumer, which includes our specialty consumer lending verticals, was offset by lower residential mortgage and home equity loans. We did experience a 3% linked-quarter increase in consumer loan production driven by non-real estate lending, which drove period-end indirect auto and other consumer balances, each higher by 2% on a linked-quarter basis. Importantly, we're not sacrificing our credit standards or pricing discipline to drive growth. Credit metrics remain relatively stable and new consumer loan production spreads are accretive to the portfolio. Although overall deposit growth remains muted, we're continuing to add new clients and households. We opened nearly 200,000 new digital loan and deposit accounts during the quarter, including over 75,000 new-to-bank clients through our digital channels, which represents a 35% increase over the third quarter of last year. Net new checking account growth was once again positive in the third quarter as we grew 40,000 new consumer and business accounts, bringing our total to 108,000 year-to-date. Not only are we adding new households, but primacy rates and client retention also continue to increase due to improvements to the client experience as we rolled out more than 130 enhancements to our digital experience during the quarter. In wholesale, I'm encouraged by the underlying momentum in terms of improved production, increased wallet share within certain businesses and the talent we're attracting to our company. During the quarter, we saw a 1% growth in commercial deposits and a 4% increase in wholesale lending production, which was offset by lower line utilization and higher paydowns due in part to greater capital markets activity, which is an area where we have invested consistently. The third quarter represents the strongest capital markets quarter we've reported since 2021 as investment banking revenues increased 79% year-over-year and 43% year-to-date. We experienced record quarterly performance in equity capital markets, investment-grade issuance, public finance and asset securitization. The growth is tied to our focus on gaining greater mindshare with our clients across our industry verticals, which has led to an increase in the number of lead roles across several product lines. We're continuing to invest in our wholesale platform as we've made several key new hires this quarter in commercial banking, corporate banking, investment banking, wealth and payments and plan to add additional talent in the fourth quarter and beyond. These new teammates complement our great existing teams and have significant experience in many cases from larger institutions and are attracted to our results-oriented culture. As I mentioned last quarter, we have a specific focus on further building out our middle-market commercial lending segment, which represents one of the largest growth opportunities within our regional businesses. We'll primarily focus on industries that support existing corporate investment banking coverage and expertise where we've gained significant share. We also continue to enhance our wholesale digital capabilities by improving the client experience. During the quarter, we launched several significant enhancements to the Truist One View platform, including the ability for clients to securely chat directly with treasury management specialists. Enhancing the client experience and growing our digital capabilities are important parts of our strategy, which I'll discuss in more detail on Slide 7. We continue to show strong and steady growth in our digital capabilities as client mobile app users grew 6% and digital transactions increased 15% compared to the third quarter of 2023. We continue to migrate clients towards self-service capabilities, primarily driven by strong growth in Zelle transactions, which are up 36% year-over-year. In addition to an increase in account openings, we're also seeing an improvement in the funding of our digital account openings with balances up significantly over the third quarter of last year. Our recently enhanced digital deposit application experience has helped drive a 49% increase in mobile device applications, which now account for 72% of total digital applications. These improvements also drove a 500 basis point linked-quarter increase in the conversion rate on new digital applications, driving productivity and leading strong digital client satisfaction scores. We're not only better serving and growing with our clients, but we're also doing that more efficiently. So, now let me turn it over to Mike to discuss the financial results and I'll come back after that and close us out. Mike Maguire : Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As a high-level summary, we reported third quarter 2024 GAAP net income available to common shareholders of $1.3 billion or $0.99 per share. Our adjusted EPS was $0.97 per share, which included a $36 million pre-tax or $0.01 per share after-tax increase to the gain on sale of Truist Insurance Holdings and a $16 million pretax or another $0.01 per share after-tax reduction on the FDIC special assessment. Total revenue adjusted for the losses on the available-for-sale investment securities that were sold in the second quarter increased by 2.4% linked quarter due to a 2.2% increase in net interest income and 3.1% growth in non-interest income driven primarily by growth in investment banking and trading revenue. Adjusted expenses increased 0.9% linked-quarter but were down approximately 2.3% on a like-quarter basis, reflecting lower personnel costs. Moving on to capital. Our CET1 ratio remained relatively stable linked-quarter at 11.6% as current period earnings and a smaller balance sheet were offset by the payment of our common dividend and share repurchases completed during the quarter. From a credit perspective, net charge-offs declined by 3 basis points on a linked-quarter basis and our non-performing loans remained relatively stable both on a like and linked-quarter basis. Next, getting into additional detail, I'll cover loans and leases on Slide 9. Average loans decreased $3 billion or 1% on a sequential basis, reflecting overall weaker commercial client demand and line utilization, partially offset by modest growth in consumer loans. Average commercial loans decreased by $3.2 billion or 1.7%, primarily due to a decline in C&I balances driven again by lower line utilization and at least in part by greater capital markets activity. In our consumer portfolio, average loans remained relatively stable linked-quarter as growth in indirect auto and service finance was offset with lower residential mortgage loans. As Bill mentioned, production improved in both consumer and wholesale lending, but paydowns and runoff in certain categories like commercial and residential real estate will likely result in continued pressure on an average balance basis in the fourth quarter, likely similar to the rate of decline that we experienced in the third quarter. Moving to deposit trends on Slide 10. Average deposits decreased 1% sequentially or $3.7 billion with approximately $1.7 billion of the decline due to lower brokered deposits. Average non-interest bearing deposits decreased 1.4% and represented 28% of total deposits, which is unchanged versus the second quarter of 2024. The $1.7 billion decline in average brokered deposits reduced our total and interest-bearing deposit costs by 1 basis point sequentially to 2.08% and 2.88%, respectively. Overall, we expect deposit balances to remain relatively stable in the fourth quarter. Moving to net interest income and net interest margin on Slide 12. Taxable equivalent net interest income increased 2.2% linked-quarter or $77 million, primarily due to the strategic balance sheet repositioning we completed during the second quarter, a reduction in higher-cost wholesale funding and the impact of one additional day in the third quarter. These tailwinds were partially offset by the impact of additional received fixed interest-rate swaps that became effective during the quarter and by lower commercial loan balances. Reported net interest margin increased 10 basis points on a linked-quarter basis to 3.12% due primarily to the securities repositioning I just mentioned and a reduction in higher cost wholesale funding. Returning to non-interest income on Slide 12. Adjusted non-interest income increased $45 million or 3.1% relative to the second quarter. The linked-quarter increase was primarily attributable to higher other income and higher investment banking and trading income, which improved $46 million due to higher M&A, equity capital markets and investment-grade fees. Adjusted non-interest income increased 11% on a like-quarter basis due to higher investment banking and trading income and higher service charge on deposit income. Next, I'll cover non-interest expense on Slide 13. GAAP expenses of $2.9 billion decreased $167 million linked-quarter, primarily due to lower other expenses as the second quarter included a $150 million charitable donation. Regulatory costs decreased by $34 million, partially due to a $16 million reduction on the FDIC special assessment, which was recognized in 3Q24. Adjusted non-interest expense increased 0.9% sequentially due to higher professional fees, other, and marketing expense, partially offset by lower personnel expense. On a like-quarter basis, adjusted expenses declined by $67 million or 2.3%, reflecting lower personnel and other expenses. Now, moving to asset quality on Slide 14. Asset quality remained stable on both a like and linked-quarter basis, reflecting our strong credit risk culture and proactive approach to quickly resolving problem loans. During the quarter, our net charge-off ratio decreased 3 basis points to 55 basis points due primarily to lower losses in our CRE portfolio. Our loan loss provision remained relatively stable linked-quarter and includes a $25 million provision related to Hurricane Helene. The provision exceeded net charge-offs for the fourth quarter, which along with lower loan balances resulted in a 3 basis point increase in our ALLL ratio to 1.60%. Non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans remained relatively stable for the fourth consecutive quarter, while total delinquencies were also flat on a linked-quarter basis. Included in our appendix is updated data on our office portfolio, which is down $232 million linked-quarter to 1.5% of total loans. Our office reserve increased from 9.7% to 10.4%, driven by continued expected stress in the office sector. Approximately 5.1% of our office portfolio is currently classified as non-performing compared with 6.3% at June 30. Approximately 90% of these loan balances are paying in accordance with the original terms of the loan. Notably, approximately 21% of our office portfolio is housed within our commercial community banking and wealth segments, where loan sizes tend to be more granular, guarantor support more prevalent and overall loss is lower. We expect stress to remain in the office sector and believe that the size of our portfolio is manageable and well-reserved, but our position is to be very proactive in identifying and resolving issues in this portfolio. Turning to capital on Slide 15. Truist CET1 ratio remained relatively stable linked-quarter at 11.6% as current period earnings were offset by the return of $1.2 billion in capital to shareholders via our common stock dividend and the repurchase of $500 million of our shares. Our CET1 capital ratio, including the impact of AOCI, increased from 9.6% to 9.9%, reflecting a $1.6 billion linked-quarter improvement in AOCI due to the decline in longer-term interest rates experienced during the quarter. Although we await the final proposal for the Basel III Endgame rules, we believe that our current strong capital position gives us the unique ability to utilize our future earnings and AOCI accretion to fund balance sheet growth and return a significant amount of capital to our shareholders. I will now review our updated guidance on Slide 16. Looking into the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect revenue to decrease 1.5% from the third quarter of 2024 adjusted revenue of $5.1 billion. We expect net interest income to decrease 1.5% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by lower commercial loan balances and some pressure to our net interest margin due to the temporary lag in our deposit beta. Our net interest income outlook assumes two 25 basis point reductions in the federal funds rate over the remainder of 2024, one cut in November and another cut in December. We expect non-interest income to decline by 2%, driven primarily by lower investment banking and trading revenue as the third quarter performance was helped by some pull-forward of capital markets activity from the fourth into the third quarter. Adjusted expenses of $2.8 billion in the third quarter are expected to increase 4% in the third quarter, driven by investments in areas such as talent, our digital platforms, marketing and risk infrastructure. For the full year 2024, consistent with our previous guidance, we expect revenues to be down 0.5% to down 1%, which reflects our updated outlook for the fourth quarter. As Bill mentioned, we now expect full-year 2024 adjusted expenses to be slightly lower than 2023 adjusted expenses versus our previous expectation for expenses to remain approximately flat. In terms of asset quality, we previously expected net charge-offs of about 65 basis points for full year 2024, we would now expect net charge-offs to be closer to 60 basis points in 2024. As it relates to buybacks, similar to the third quarter, we are targeting approximately $500 million of share repurchases in the fourth quarter. Finally, we expect our effective tax rate to approximate 17.5% or 20% on a taxable equivalent basis in the fourth quarter of 2024. I will now hand it back to Bill for some final remarks. Bill Rogers : Great. Thank you, Mike. So, in conclusion, I'm really pleased with the progress we've made as a company this year and I'm confident that we've got tremendous momentum within our company with our clients and with our teammates as our value proposition has never been stronger. First, we've got an incredible franchise with leading share in high-growth markets. We've got highly motivated and energized teammates. We have a fulsome set of specialized wholesale and consumer capabilities that our loyal clients value. Our relative capital advantage is a differentiating factor that gives us a unique ability to grow our core banking businesses by serving existing and new clients, invest in our infrastructure and return considerable amounts of capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the next several years. As we execute our strategic growth and capital management priorities, we see a significant opportunity to improve our profitability over the medium term. Our path to profitability improvement is multifaceted and a function of client and business growth while maintaining our cost discipline. I can say that I'm encouraged that much of the profitability improvement potential we're working towards is centered on further deepening of existing client relationships and verticals and product lines that already exist at Truist. The good news is we see multiple paths and initiatives that with proper execution will result in improved performance, while we don't have to experiment with new products or expand into new markets to achieve our goals. We plan to accomplish all of this while maintaining our expense discipline and focus on generating positive long-term operating leverage, while also continuing to invest in talent, technology and our infrastructure. Although it's too early to provide specific earnings guidance for 2025, based on the current momentum, the confidence in our teams and our franchise, where we are in the planning cycle, we do expect to achieve positive operating leverage next year. Finally, we'll never take for granted our strong track record on asset quality as we continue to focus on maintaining strong risk discipline and controls. I'm as optimistic as ever about Truist's future, especially in light of the success I see every day inside our company. I'd like to thank all of our teammates and all of our leaders for their incredible purposeful focus and productivity in moving our company forward. Again, thank you for your interest and investment in Truist. And with that, Brad, let me turn it back over to you for Q&A. Brad Milsaps : Thank you, Bill. Betsy, at this time, will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session? As you do that, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourselves to one primary question and one follow-up in order that we can may accommodate as many of you on the call today as possible. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Scott Siefers : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the question. Mike, I was hoping you could please maybe unpack the fourth quarter margin guidance a bit more. For overall NII, I certainly understand the ongoing pressure on loans, but was hoping you might be able to sort of walk through thoughts on how quickly deposit betas might be able to catch up to help support or ideally enhance the margin and then just make some top-level thoughts about the company's overall rate sensitivity at this point. Mike Maguire : Yeah. Good morning, Scott. Happy to do that. From a NIM perspective, maybe just to sort of start with the third quarter and give you the trend into the fourth and maybe even give you a sense for kind of where we go from there and I'll link that to the beta. The bulk of the improvement that we saw in the third quarter was really driven by the repositioning. So the 10 basis points from 3.02% to 3.12%. As you look into the fourth quarter, we mentioned the temporary beta lag. We do expect two cuts in the fourth. We did see some improvement in the third, you'll recall. We were better by a basis point on, call it, an average funds rate that was better by 7 basis points for the quarter. So started at, call it, a 15% beta. Our outlook for the fourth quarter is that while we'll accelerate significantly, call it, into the mid, maybe even high 30% from a beta perspective, that will still lag a touch relative to how quickly the assets are repricing. So we see some margin compression there. Maybe it's to the same tune as we guided NII, so call it a 1.5% or so of net interest margin down into the sort of low 3.05%, 3.06% area. We would expect that to catch up very, very early, probably in the first quarter of 2025, and would expect to see the margin stabilize, I'd say, in the first quarter and then begin to improve as we have further cuts as we get into 2025. Scott Siefers : All right. Perfect. That's great color and thank you. And then just wanted to ask separately. So, you did the really large balance repositioning earlier this year. I've gotten the impression that that was sort of all you planned there, but you have so much capital flexibility relative to so many banks out there. Would -- any thoughts on further opportunities to do so, or is it sort of stand pat on that front? Mike Maguire : Yeah. Look, I think you're right, and we feel like we took a pretty big swing at this in May and have now fully realized at least the benefit into the run rate in the third quarter. We do think that our capital position is an advantage. We're trying to be patient, very focused on growing the business. Bill's talked a lot about the various initiatives in both of our business segments where we do think we're going to have an opportunity to grow footings and leverage capital. Obviously, as that's been a little slower to develop, we're buying back shares at an elevated level. I think we would expect to continue buying back shares at an elevated level. I think the repositioning incrementally, I don't think we want to ever put the tool back in the toolbox necessarily, but I think it's a lower priority for us based on what else we see in front of us. Scott Siefers : Yeah. Got it. All right. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Bill Rogers : Betsy. Mike Maguire : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Bill, you mentioned with proper execution deliver on the goals here, the targets that you have. Could you help us understand what do you mean by proper execution? Is that just hitting the goals or is there a change in how you're operating that delivers proper execution? Bill Rogers : Yeah, I mean, Betsy, there's a real strong focus on expanding our relationships with our existing clients. I'm really pleased with the momentum we've created in the execution. Coming out of the merger, there was a lot of diversion and a lot of focus on activities of getting clients converted and getting teammates onboarded and all those type things. And that's just way behind us. And now the team's really focused on executing against our priorities. We've got a really strong focus and clarity about what we want to accomplish. So when I say proper execution, maybe it's -- I should better have said continuation of the execution momentum that we've started and you see some of that in this quarter. You see increase in primacy rates, you see that continuation of net new. So all these things that are demonstrable evidence of the fact that we're continuing to expand and grow our relationships with our clients. So proper probably ought to be continuation and improved momentum against existing execution. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then, as we're thinking about the positive operating leverage into 2025, how much of that is being driven by deposit beta lags catching up here with Fed funds? I mean, is that the major driver of how we're thinking about operating leverage as we roll into '25? Bill Rogers : Well, you've got all the factors that come into it. So, first is the momentum in the business that we have. So take investment banking, let's use that as one example. The momentum we have in this quarter, continuing that type of momentum into next year, as an example. The loan growth activity is going to -- I think we're confident it's going to return. We saw production increases this quarter. Particularly on the consumer side, we saw loan production up around 3%. We saw real increases in the areas that we can lean into. Think about the things you know about like service, finance and Sheffield, and so we saw really good momentum there. Increase in production on the wholesale side. But the utilization was the lowest this quarter. It's been in the last five quarters. So we expect to see some of that return. So we've got some loan dependencies, we've got some executional dependencies, some fee dependencies, and then, as you mentioned, the deposit beta. And I'm really pleased with the team. I mean, I'm -- Mike and team have provided really great leadership, working really closely with Kristin and Donta on the businesses to really be on top of where we are from deposit betas. And Mike indicating, we've already had a little bit of movement, expect a little bit of lag, but, sort of see that transitioning in the first quarter of next year and then continuing from there. And then the final factor is the expense side. So the other side of that is controlling expenses. And hopefully, we're giving good evidence of the fact that we've got a good handle on our expenses. We're going to be down this year versus last year. And I think we've got a really good capacity to correlate our expense growth with our revenue growth opportunity. So it's a lot of things. Maybe it's a long answer to a short question, but all of those things, I think, have the requisite amount of focus and attention and we don't have a single dependency. We're going to manage them all really tightly and really well with a focus on achieving that positive operating leverage. Betsy Graseck : Thanks so much. Operator : The next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Bill Rogers : Good morning. Erika Najarian : Good morning. My first question is a follow-up. Mike, you mentioned a little bit of guidance on the fourth quarter. As we think about the trajectory from here and fully appreciate we're not getting specific '25 color today. As we think about the structure of your asset side versus your liability side, should we assume that from that 3.05%, 3.06% level that assets can start repricing faster than liabilities in 1Q, but then there's a day count impact on NII that's negative or will the assets repricing faster than liabilities go -- come later? And to that end, you mentioned the swaps. If you could give us a little bit more color on the swaps, what the notional active is, what the weighted fixed -- received fixed rate is, so we can factor that into our modeling. Mike Maguire : Yeah, sure. Good morning, Erika. As it relates to the, I call it, just maybe the NIM trajectory, I think you've got it right. Well, actually, let me say this. So we do expect in the fourth quarter for the beta to accelerate, I mentioned, call it, mid-high 30s. We would expect that to continue and essentially catch up in the first quarter. So at that point, we would expect to actually have the balance sheet behaving a touch liability sensitive again after an asset-sensitive fourth quarter. And so really as we move deeper into '25, again, a lot of variables here. We would expect the net interest margin to begin to expand a touch. So that's a good guide. And I think you mentioned a day count. I'm glad you brought that up. There are two fewer days in the first quarter. So as you think about actual NII dollars, while we might see a more stable earning asset base in the first, we might see a more stable net interest margin, you might still feel a touch of pressure from a dollars of NII perspective. I think I got most of your questions 1a and 1b. On the swaps, let's see, we did -- as you know well, we have two programs that we use to manage our rate position. We've got our receive fixed program, which we primarily rely on to manage our NII sensitivity and risks and opportunities and we have our pay fix program to manage our asset values, manage our capital volatility risk in the future, AOCI, et cetera. We did have some activity in the positions. During the quarter, we added about $15 billion give or take of forward-starting receivers during the third quarter. That takes notional up into the, call it, $60 billion or so area. We also added about $5 billion of pay fix swaps we added to the investment portfolio during the quarter as well. So had some accompanied activity there. In terms of active versus sort of forward-starting, we did have -- I mentioned in our NII results sort of description, we had a touch of a headwind in the third versus the second quarter based on about $12 billion of incremental received fixed swaps becoming active during the quarter. That was a manageable headwind. As we look at the fourth quarter, we really don't have much else coming on throughout the course of the year. We will have more active in 2025, but that's going to come on, frankly, the -- who knows, the curve could change. But based on the curve that we see today, that's going to come on and actually be less of a headwind each quarter into 2025. Our received fixed rate, you asked, Erika, is around 3.40% on that notional. Erika Najarian : Got it. And my follow-up question -- and thanks for all the detail. For Bill, based on what Mike just said, you should have NII growth next year. If everything is supposed to come true that the market's thinking in terms of capital market strength in '25, you'll benefit from that as you did this quarter. If the market is good volatile as it could be after an election and a change in administration, that could be good for your wealth management business as well. So as we think about Truist on offense and fully appreciate that you're aiming for positive operating leverage. Are you thinking about your expense base just -- really just more relative to that revenue -- potential revenue strength in '25? In other words, should we think about Truist on offense rather than, because of this and that, we have to think about managing expenses because of all the issues with the merger integration? So wanted to get your thoughts there. And additionally, some longer-term investors have asked me, why will Truist operate in the mid-teens in terms of ROTCE if their two super-regional peers are aiming to earn in the high-teens or the mid-to-high teens and I suspect that might be a capital adjustment. I know that's a compound question, but I wanted to get your thoughts on both. Thank you so much. Bill Rogers : Yeah. Thanks for the comprehensive questions. I think you've characterized the first part of that question exactly right, in the sense of that we are on offense and you can feel it in our company, you can feel it in the results, you can see it in the things that we talked about in terms of this third quarter, and you outlined many of those in terms of momentum. We think about the expense side, and this is the concept of what I talked about our commitment to long-term operating leverage is the expenses are correlated to that opportunity. And I think today we've got the calibration correlated. I think, as you noted, it was sort of uncorrelated as we were coming out of the merger. And today, I think we've got a really good handle on the capacity to invest and win and grow and be on offense and have those be correlated. Again, you saw good evidence of that in this quarter. So there isn't a merger hangover or other activity related to the expenses. We've been investing. We're going to continue to invest and we see the results of that in our top-line revenue growth and opportunity. So again, higher correlated and commitment to have an efficient company. So we're operating today at a really much stronger efficiency ratio. So we didn't talk about that. So this commitment to have positive operating leverage on the platform of a really efficient company. So let's put that in one category. And then on the ROTCE side, I think you highlighted sort of the starting point is a little bit different, right, because of the sale of the insurance business and the creation of a lot of capital. So we start sort of from a different framework. I think about it as the speed and increase in terms of return. So, our speed of increase in return, I think, is unparalleled. So where we start from, our ability to deploy capital, both in growing our business and returning capital to our shareholders, I think, has the capacity to grow our ROTCE faster than anybody else. And then once we get to that mid-teens sort of level, then our business model starts to reflect more of what we talked about in the first part of my answer, then I think we sort of catapult from there. But the key is we have the most ability to grow our return over the medium term. Hope that answers it. Erika Najarian : Helpful. Thank you so much. Yeah, perfect. Operator : The next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hey, good morning. I guess maybe just the first question and apologies if I missed it. I think you mentioned pace of buybacks relative to the $0.5 billion this quarter. Should we -- is there room or are you thinking about increasing the pace of those buybacks in the near term if loan growth is muted or should we assume that $500 million is relatively locked-in for the next several quarters? Bill Rogers : Yeah, this is Bill. So I think we ought to think about it as it's going to stay at an elevated level for some period of time. We've been very clear that we see opportunities to grow our business. So, we want to make sure that we've got ample capital to do that and invest in the growth. If we see that as being much longer than sort of our current view, we have the opportunity to recalibrate or to stay at elevated levels longer or to increase those elevated levels. But for now, I think, and so we talked about the fourth quarter and how we would enter the first part of next year, we're doing that with a lot of confidence in the ability to grow our business. Ebrahim Poonawala : Understood. And just on that, and I think you responded slightly to Betsy's question earlier, if you think -- from an outside standpoint, and you mentioned that Truist is now like done with the overhang with the deal. Just remind us, Bill, when we think about the momentum and growth, where across your businesses do you expect to grow market share? And do you feel like you're at a point where the bank will stop [leading] (ph) market share to smaller or out-of-market competitors who have been aggressive in terms of hiring across the Southeast? Thanks. Bill Rogers : Yeah, I mean, let's talk about market share in terms of all of our businesses. So, starting with the investment banking side, we've increased market share consistently through this year in virtually every discipline. So, on the margin increased share in every discipline. And then when I think about share, I think about the things that we talked about in terms of, for example, net new. We've really had a really strong focus on net new growth. So when I think about share, it's growing our -- growing share with clients. So increasing the number of net new clients, and that's sort of an incredible hallmark. And then when I think about share, it's primacy within our existing client base. So, are we growing our primacy in terms of our share? And this quarter, particularly, both on the wholesale side in terms of treasury penetration and on the consumer side in terms of product penetration, we grew primacy with all of our clients. So, yes, we have a lot of new clients coming into our markets. I mean, a lot of new competitors coming into our markets, because we have great markets, but our primacy and our net new and our capacity to serve our clients and grow in our share as we look at the important parts of share, I feel really, really comfortable with. And that -- and that's going to continue. So that pace is granted, started slower out of the merger, but now is at a really good pace and I expect that to continue. Ebrahim Poonawala : Noted. Thanks, Bill. Operator : The next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi, good morning. Bill Rogers : Hey, Mike. Mike Mayo : Bill, we get more meat on the bones for the financial expectations in 2025 and beyond, such as the definition of long-term when you talk about operating leverage in 2025, are you talking about more than $1, give some kind of level of the term -- medium-term when you talk about returns, what year are you thinking? And the reason I ask is, I'm trying to better understand the accountability of management to shareholders. And I've written about this, but in the third quarter, you lowered the return targets from 2019 when it was low-20s to mid-teens. At the same time, you granted a special extra leadership bonus award to some executive officers and that was on top of awards they already get PSUs, RSUs, LTIP, annual incentive awards. And for what looks like fixing a problem that Truist caused, the asset-liability management pre the current CFO. And then there's the question about morale for those who didn't get the award, I mean, two of the five named executive officers, I recognize, Bill, you did not get that award, but there's others in the 24-member operating committee who I assume did not get that. So aside from the morale and reconciling pay with performance, I'm just looking at today's slides and I don't see the word shareholders when you say on the slide that says mission, on the slide that says Why Truist? And you have taken some steps. You restructured the Board, the balance sheet, you reordered the company, you sold TIS -- TIH, you cut expenses, but still shareholders, the stocks underperformed. It's the bottom line. Stocks underperformed over most time frames since you announced the merger. So again, that's my big tee-up. Can you give us more detail on financial expectations after the fourth quarter and the key metrics that you think should drive a higher stock price? Thanks. Bill Rogers : Sure. Thanks, Mike. And thanks for acknowledging the efforts that have been underway. Let me first say, as it relates to the deck, every slide is about shareholders. So just want to be really, really clear about that. Everything we do is about shareholders. So that is all in context. As it relates to the ROTCE specifically, I would say what we do -- we did is reset sort of post the sale of TIH. So it was appropriate to sort of reset the return post TIH because we generate a lot of capital and we changed the construct of our business in terms of return. We created a significant amount of capital, so that actually lowers the return to create that capital. But as we deploy that capital, we increase that return. And I think as I said earlier to an answer, I think our capacity to increase that return is we're in the best position of anybody because we've got that capital and that capacity to deploy it quickly both in our business and as a return to our shareholders. So we raised it efficiently and I think we have a chance to deploy and return it efficiently. In terms of the elements that are part of -- a part of that return, hopefully, those are many things that I've talked about and focus on things that are critical to expanding relationships with existing clients in markets and places where we already have committed capital and resources. So these are things that have higher returns and faster paybacks. So if you think about our strategy, it's not focused on these long-term paybacks and going to markets and trying new things, this is about really executing against the opportunities that we have in our existing franchise and increasing that return faster with higher paybacks. When I talk about medium-term, the definition of that is somewhere in that three-year kind of range, but that also depends on sort of where the economy is and what we see in terms of growth and what we see in terms of rates. So that could go faster, that could go slower. But the key is we'll have momentum against that. And again, I think you see that in this quarter. I think you'll continue to see that. We'll use the capital as an answer to the earlier question. We'll use that capital as a lever. So we can return that capital in many ways to the shareholders, all of which will increase returns, I think, faster than others are capable of doing. I have tremendous confidence in our team. Again, I think you see evidence of many of that. And then as it relates to the operating leverage, we just have to let us get into the year a little bit more, let us sort of see where things are coming in terms of where rates are going and where we see asset growth. But that commitment to positive operating leverage is a continuous one. So, I think we'll make that transition next year, as I said earlier, and then we'll continue to improve on that transition year-over-year as the returns improve to the earlier part of my answer. Mike Mayo : And then just a follow-up to the incentive -- the incentives for management. I think you changed and I cuddled up with the Page 67 of the proxy last night, that's what you do if you're a bank analyst for a long time. And I'm just trying -- and I also saw the release that you had this quarter -- or then the third quarter and it looks like there's like 12 financial metrics and then five non-financial metrics and there's so many different metrics that driving compensation. If you had to pick one or two key metrics that we on the outside can monitor and focus on that should drive shareholder value, what should they be? Bill Rogers : Yeah. I mean, appreciate you diving into the proxy. I think as you dive into that proxy, you'll see compensation based on performance. So I think you'll see that actually quite clearly. So, don't assume that we don't have that mentality at this company. And I think the primary measures that we look at are ROTCE and growth in our business. So you have to have really good return and you have to have growth. So we're looking at total book value per share plus dividends plus ROTCE. So total absolute growth and total relative return growth. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Bill Rogers : And I think those, in fairness, are the highest correlated to share price return. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O\u2019Connor: Hi. Good morning. In the prepared remarks, you guys mentioned about increasing in the fourth quarter investments related to risk infrastructure. I was just wondering if you could elaborate on what that is and the drivers of, I guess, why now? Bill Rogers : Yeah, I mean, Matt, that's a continuation of the investments that we have in the risk infrastructure. So -- and that's everything you can think of in terms of how we build a more enduring consistent infrastructure. So think about the investments in cyber, think about the investments in data, all the tight things that go along with that investment. They're bumpy by quarter, but they are increasing and part of our overall guidance. And so in the fourth quarter, we just had some specific items that were more unique to that quarter, but they're also factored into the guidance that we've given on positive operating leverage for next year. We're going to continue to invest in infrastructure. This isn't a one-time unusual thing. This is a continuous investment for a company our size with the responsibilities and the obligations we have to our clients, regulators and our shareholders. Matt O\u2019Connor: And I know when you combine the two companies, you guys made a lot of investments in, call it, the gut to the company, taking the best of both and creating some new platforms. Maybe just like give us a quick snapshot of like what is there still to do? Like, is it catching up on something? Is it just kind of business as usual staying up-to-date like all the other banks are doing? Bill Rogers : Yeah. I think in terms of basically the risk infrastructure, I mean, the -- we've seen the elevation of expectations of how we manage data. We've seen elevated expectations in AI and the investments that we want to make there. We've seen elevated expectations in terms of cyber. So they're really more -- not things that were left out of the merger, but things that are just continuous improvement of what we want to do and be responsive to the opportunities and challenges that exist in our -- in financial services. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Hi, Bill. Hi, Mike. Bill Rogers : Hey, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Can you guys share with us, Bill, in your prepared remarks and you talked about market share in response to a question, but you were talking about wallet share, how in some of your businesses you're gaining wallet share. Can you share with us how can we as outsiders measure that success, growing that wallet share? And second, what are you doing to grow that wallet share that's showing up that maybe you didn't see three years or four years ago? Bill Rogers : Yeah. I mean the best way to see the wallet share gain is see it in the overall returns of our business. So I -- if you think about the return expectations and increasing ROTCE, think about that for us as increasing ROA. Think about that as the focus. So we have the assets deployed, we have resources deployed and we increased the penetration. This time we talked about checking primacy up 1%. We talked about treasury management penetration of our commercial base up 1%. So hopefully, we're giving you that kind of information that's consistent to demonstrate that primacy, but you primarily see it in the returns. So that's the focus. I mean, that's the big way we drive returns for this business is improving our improving our primacy with our clients. Gerard Cassidy : And following up on that primacy comment, Bill, how do you guys intersect or interlock your pursuit of the digital channel with primacy? It seems like the industry you guys included, there is the optimal kind of mix is having physical branches as well as the digital channel. Do most of the primacy relationships still come through the brick-and-mortar or are you seeing some success in building it through the digital channel? Bill Rogers : Well, you're really on it and the answer is both. We have this concept called T3. So this concept of that touch and technology equals trust. So what we want to do and the capability that we've built, for example, our clients in Truist Assist. So, our digital clients can you have a virtual assistant to sort of help them in their transactions, but what we believe is that they also have the opportunity to then transition to a human interaction with that. So you've got to sort of supply both of those opportunities. When a client is interacting with us digitally and shows up in our branch, we want to be able to follow up on that transaction and continue that process. So I think they're actually both really important as part of the overall process. And it never becomes more clear in something like we've experienced in the last few weeks in the storms. So those economies go to cash during that particular time. So our branches and our ATMs are the most important thing that those communities need at that time. They don't have access to digital, Internet is down, power is down. So being able to toggle between both of those and making sure that we serve our clients in the way that they can be best be served. And that's why I led with that in this particular commentary is just to show how important both of those things are because the goal is to create an enduring relationship with the community and with the client. And we do that by investing in the channels that are most important to them, when they're most important to them. Gerard Cassidy : Appreciate that. Thank you, Bill. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over for any closing remarks. Brad Milsaps : Okay. Thank you, Betsy. That completes our earnings call. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team. Thank you for your interest in Truist and we hope you have a great day. Betsy, you may now disconnect the call. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Truist Financial Corporation Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Brad Milsaps. Brad Milsaps : Thank you, Betsy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist's fourth quarter 2024 earnings call. With us today are our Chairman and CEO, Bill Rogers; our CFO, Mike Maguire; and Chief Risk Officer, Brad Bender; as well as other members of Truist's senior management team. During this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's fourth quarter results, share their perspectives on current business conditions, and provide an updated outlook for 2025. The accompanying presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the Truist Investor Relations website, ir.truist.com. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slides 2 and 3 of the presentation, regarding these statements and measures, as well as the appendix for appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. With that, I'll turn it over to Bill. Bill Rogers : Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. So before we get started, I want to take a moment to introduce Brad Bender. Brad recently became our Chief Risk Officer. He brings extensive experience across a number of Truist areas, including risk operations, technology and consumer lending to his role. Brad is off to a great start. He'll continue to carry forward Truist's strong credit culture and risk discipline. Clarke Starnes, I'm really happy, is working closely with Brad on the transition. I'm incredibly grateful for Clarke's impactful 40-plus-year career at Truist, most recently serving as our Chief Risk Officer. Also want to thank Beau Cummins for his significant contributions to our company following his announced departure this week. Since 2005, Beau has purposely served as an instrumental leader at Truist, most recently as Vice Chair and Chief Operating Officer. Both he and Clark played crucial and formative roles in the merger of equals to create Truist and setting the course for our future. I just can't tell you how much I appreciate their leadership during this time at Truist. They were fantastic partners. I just wish them all the best in their new chapters in their lives. All right. So, let's -- before turning to fourth quarter results, let's begin, as we always do at Truist, with purpose. We are a purpose driven company dedicated to inspiring and building better lives and communities, which is the foundation and guide for how we conduct our business. So one example in the fourth quarter was our response to Hurricane Helene. The impact of the Hurricane on Western North Carolina was truly unprecedented. Truist has deep roots in the region, and our team was quick to respond, but they were also compelled to play a pivotal role in the area's long-term recovery, aligned with our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities. We announced a three-year $725 million commitment to address critical needs, including a focus on small business, housing, and infrastructure projects. By listening to the needs of the community and leveraging our expertise, our capital partnerships, we believe we can be a catalyst for recovery and growth. So now turning to our results on Slide 5. For the fourth quarter, we reported net income available to common shareholders of $1.2 billion or $0.91 a share. For the year, we reported GAAP net income of $4.5 billion or $3.36 a share and adjusted net income of $5 billion or $3.69 per share. Mike, is going to provide some more details on quarterly and annual results later in the call. 2024 was an important year for Truist, and I'm proud of the results our teammates delivered, which included executing on several important strategic initiatives, delivering solid underlying earnings, maintaining sound asset quality metrics and positioning us with strong momentum as we enter 2025. Our solid performance was defined by several key themes. First, 2024 ended on a strong note with annual adjusted revenue finishing at the high end of our expectations and annual expenses declining 40 basis points. Our adjusted efficiency ratio of 56.3% remained relatively stable on an annual basis, reflecting on ongoing expense discipline and focus on managing cost. In addition, on a linked quarter basis, average deposit balances increased 1.5% and average loan balances were stable. End-of-period loans experienced a little over 1% growth as we saw an increase in loan demand due to the results of our focused initiatives in the latter half of the quarter. These factors, along with our continued discipline around rate paid on deposits, resulted in net interest income exceeding our expectations for the quarter. Investment banking and trading revenue increased 46% for the year versus 2023, as we continue to add talent and expertise to an already strong platform that continues to gain market share. Credit metrics remain solid as nonperforming loans held-for-investment declined $38 million linked quarter, while net charge-offs increased 4 basis points in the fourth quarter, resulting in losses for the year coming in line with our expectations. Our CET1 capital ratio finished the year at 11.5%, which is up 140 basis points versus 2023, due to the gain on the sale of Truist Insurance Holdings in 2024 earnings, partially offset by the strategic balance sheet repositioning completed in May and $3.8 billion of capital we returned to shareholders through our common dividend and the repurchase of $1 billion of our common stock. The execution of these important strategic initiatives and resulting relative capital advantage leaves us well positioned to grow our balance sheet and return capital to shareholders through our common dividend and our share repurchase program. In 2025, we're focused on five key areas, all aimed at driving better growth, positive operating leverage, and improved profitability. First, last year was a testament to the attractiveness of our platform, attracting, developing and retaining top talent will continue to be our priority. Second, we see a material opportunity to deepen existing client relationships within our attractive footprint, especially in areas like premier banking, wealth and payments, all of which represent significant opportunities to capture additional share within our existing client base. Third, we also see growth potential beyond the markets where we have strong share, especially in states like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Texas, where we have smaller but faster growing market share. These are not new markets, but areas where we have invested significantly and have great momentum deploying our full Truist capabilities. We're also optimistic about further expanding into certain verticals in the middle market where we can bring the expertise we provide to larger companies in our investment bank to mid-sized companies all across the country. Fourth, we'll continue to invest in our technology platform, which is improving the client experience, driving new account production and delivering efficiencies. Finally, we plan to accomplish all of this while maintaining our expense discipline, driving positive operating leverage, and investing in important areas like our risk infrastructure and cybersecurity. Maintaining our momentum and executing against these strategic priorities will be the key to driving positive operating leverage this year and showing progress towards our mid-teens medium-term ROATCE target. Before I hand the call over to Mike to discuss our quarterly results, I want to spend a little bit of time discussing the progress we're already making on our strategic priorities and the positive momentum we're seeing within our business segments and with our digital initiatives on Slide 6 and 7. In Consumer & Small Business Banking, I'm encouraged by our momentum as we experienced an increase in loan production in key focus areas within our lending portfolio and we continue to acquire key new clients and households, both through our digital and traditional channels. Average consumer loan balances increased 1.2% linked-quarter due to the growth in residential mortgage, indirect auto, and important platforms like Sheffield and Service Finance as we experienced a 5% linked-quarter increase in consumer loan production during the quarter. Importantly, we're not sacrificing our credit standards or pricing discipline to drive growth. Credit metrics remained relatively stable and new consumer loan production spreads are accretive to the overall portfolio. Net new checking account growth was once again positive for the year as we added 104,000 new consumer and business accounts. Not only are we adding new households, but primacy rates and client retention also continue to increase due to improvements to the client experience and ongoing enhancements to our digital offerings during the year. In Wholesale, I'm encouraged by the underlying momentum in terms of improved production, increased wallet share within certain businesses and the talent that we're attracting to our Company. During the quarter, we saw a 3% growth in average Wholesale deposits, including growth in non-interest-bearing demand. Although average Wholesale loans declined linked-quarter, end-of-period balances increased 50 basis points. We saw increased production and higher commitments in certain key focus areas as clients are in a more offensive posture. As I previously noted, 2004 represented the strongest capital market share we've reported since 2021. We experienced record performance in investment-grade issuance, equity capital markets, asset securitization and project finance, while also gaining share in verticals like financial institutions, consumer retail and healthcare. Our leaders made key new hires through 2024 in commercial banking, corporate banking, investment banking, wealth, payments, and a leader of our new middle-market initiative. These new experienced teammates are attracted to our purposeful and results oriented culture and complement our great teams. As I mentioned earlier, we have a specific focus on building out our middle-market commercial segment. I'm very pleased with our focus and momentum we're already experiencing in production and results. We also continue to enhance our wholesale digital capabilities by improving the client experience. During the quarter, we launched Electronic Bill Presentment, which is a next-generation product that gives clients greater control over their billing and payments operations. Enhancing the client experience and growing our digital capabilities are important parts of our strategy, which I'll discuss in more detail on Slide 7. Throughout the year, we've invested in our digital platforms to attract new clients to Truist with a focus on shifting existing client behaviors to self-service, which drives operational efficiency. As a result of these efforts, we showed strong and steady growth in our digital capabilities as we experienced year-over-year growth in all core metrics, while also achieving favorable client experience satisfaction scores. We opened over 730,000 new digital loan and deposits accounts during the year, including nearly 275,000 new-to-bank clients through our digital channels, which represents a 31 increase over the previous year. We surpassed over 7.1 million active digital users on our platform. Client mobile app users grew 7% and digital transactions increased 13% year-over-year. In addition to an increase in account openings and higher digital adoption rates, we're also seeing improvement in the funding of our digital account openings with balances up significantly over 2023, including growth and balances for Millennial and Gen Z clients. Investing in the digital client experience continues to be a priority for our Company in 2025 and beyond. We expect to continue growing our digital presence with clients as we further leverage our modern and scalable technology platform. So with that, let me turn it over to Mike, to discuss our financial results in more detail. Mike? Mike Maguire : Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. So I'm going to start with our performance highlights. We reported fourth quarter 2024 GAAP net income available to common shareholders of $1.2 billion or $0.91 per share. Total revenue decreased 0.5% linked-quarter as both net interest income and fees, decreased modestly. Adjusted expenses increased 4% linked-quarter. And as we discussed last quarter, this increase was driven by higher professional fees and outside processing expenses related to a number of projects that were initiated later in the year. As Bill mentioned earlier, non-interest expenses declined 0.4% in 2024 versus 2023. Moving to capital, our CET1 ratio declined 10 basis points linked-quarter to 11.5% as our larger balance sheet, the payment of our common dividend, and share repurchases completed during the quarter offset our core -- quarter -- current period earnings. From a credit perspective, net charge-offs increased 4 basis points on a linked-quarter basis and our nonperforming loans declined 1 basis point on a linked-quarter basis. So moving to Slide 9, I'll cover loans and leases. Average loans remained relatively stable on a linked-quarter basis as a decline in average commercial loans was offset by growth in average consumer loans. Average commercial loans decreased $1.5 billion or 0.8%, primarily due to a decline in CRE and C&I balances driven by lower production in CRE. Commercial line utilization remained relatively stable on a linked-quarter basis. In our consumer portfolio, average loans increased $1.4 billion or 1.2% linked-quarter due to growth in indirect auto, residential mortgage, and other consumer. On an end-of-period basis, loans held for investment increased by $3.3 billion or 1.1%, primarily due to higher residential mortgages, C&I and indirect auto. As Bill mentioned, we're encouraged by the increase in end-of-period loan balances and improved loan production in certain key focus areas during the quarter. This should lead to positive growth in end-of-period loan balances in 2025. Moving to deposit trends on Slide 10. Average deposits increased 1.5% sequentially or $5.7 billion, driven by growth in all deposit categories except for time deposits, which were down linked-quarter. Average non-interest-bearing deposits increased 1.8% and represented 28% of total deposits, which is unchanged compared to the third quarter of 2024. During the quarter, we continued to actively manage rate paid, which resulted in a decrease to our deposit costs. Specifically, total deposit costs decreased 19 basis points sequentially to 1.89%, which implies a 29% cumulative total deposit beta. Interest-bearing deposit costs decreased by 26 basis points sequentially to 2.62%, representing a 40% cumulative total interest-bearing deposit beta. Overall, we expect average deposit balances to decrease by about 1% in the first quarter due in part to the outflow of seasonally higher municipal deposits. Moving to net interest income and net interest margin on Slide 11. Taxable equivalent net interest income decreased 0.4% linked-quarter or $16 million, primarily due to the lag in deposit repricing versus earning asset repricing, which was partially offset by higher earning assets and some benefit from fixed-rate asset repricing. Our net interest margin decreased by 5 basis points on a linked-quarter basis to 3.07% due primarily to the previously mentioned beta lag and a larger investment securities portfolio. Based on our current outlook, we believe that the net interest income will decline by 2% linked-quarter due primarily to the impact of two fewer days in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter and then we would expect it to trend higher in the second quarter of 2025 and throughout the course of the year. As you can see in the charts on the right, we expect net interest income to grow in 2025, driven primarily by low-single-digit end-of-period loan growth and the continued benefit from fixed asset repricing of our securities portfolio as well as our fixed-rate loan portfolios. During the fourth quarter, our average investment securities portfolio totaled $125 billion and carried a weighted average yield of 2.88%. That excludes the impact of pay-fix swaps. We expect to receive approximately $13 billion of cash flows from the investment portfolio throughout the course of 2025 that we anticipate reinvesting at higher yields. These securities roll off at a weighted average yield of 3.08%, excluding the impact of pay-fixed swaps and based on the current forward curve. In addition, our fixed average -- our average fixed-rate loan portfolio totaled $135 billion and carried a weighted average yield of 5.38% during the fourth quarter. We anticipate having the opportunity to reprice approximately $42 billion of loans at higher yields during 2025, based on current maturity schedules. These maturities -- maturing loans have a weighted average yield of approximately 6.36%. Before moving on, I also wanted to note that this quarter we added additional disclosure on our swap portfolio and that's on the bottom right-hand corner of the slide. At December 31, we had approximately $84 billion of notional received fixed swaps with a weighted average yield of 3.45%. These swaps are designated against our commercial loan portfolio and long-term debt and designed to protect net interest income from lower short-end rates. Approximately $45 billion of these swaps were effective at the end of the quarter. The remaining $39 billion of received fixed swaps are forward-starting and will become effective over time. Based on our current portfolio, at December 31, the effective received fixed swap position peaks around $63 billion during the fourth quarter of 2025. At December 31, we also had approximately $30 billion of notional pay-fixed swaps with a weighted average pay-fixed rate at 3.39%. These swaps are designed to protect the economic value of the balance sheet as well as to manage future capital volatility through AOCI as these swaps are designated against our AFS securities portfolio. At December 31, the entire $30 billion pay-fixed swap portfolio was effective with approximately half the portfolio carrying a maturity of less than three years. Okay. Turning to noninterest income on Slide 12. Noninterest income decreased $12 million or 0.9% versus the third quarter. The linked-quarter decrease was primarily attributable to lower investment banking and trading income, which declined $70 million linked-quarter, due to lower debt and equity capital markets activity and M&A fees. The decline in investment banking and trading was partially offset by growth in other income, service charge on deposits and mortgage banking income. Although fourth quarter investment banking trading income declined on a linked-quarter basis, 2024 investment banking and trading revenues increased 46% versus 2023 and represented the highest level since 2021, due to higher transaction activity levels and continued market share gains, which helped drive a 6.2% increase in adjusted non-interest income for the full-year 2024. We remain optimistic about our ability to continue to gain share and grow not only in investment banking and trading but also in wealth and payments, where we believe there is significant opportunity to grow within our existing client base. Next, I'll cover noninterest expense on Slide 13. Adjusted noninterest expense, which excludes the impact of restructuring charges and core deposit intangible amortization expense, increased 4% linked-quarter due to higher professional fees and equipment expense, partially offset by lower personnel expense in the quarter. On an annual basis, adjusted noninterest expense declined by 0.4% and our adjusted efficiency ratio remained relatively stable. Beginning with the first quarter of 2025, we will begin including core deposit intangible amortization expense with adjusted expense to make our reporting align and be more comparable with peers. Moving to asset quality on Slide 14. Asset quality remained relatively stable on both a like- and linked-quarter basis, reflecting our strong credit risk culture and proactive approach to quickly resolving problem loans. During the quarter, our net charge-off ratio increased 4 basis points to 59 basis points due primarily to seasonally higher consumer losses. Net charge-offs of 59 basis points for the year were in line with our expectation of 60 basis points. Our loan-loss provision exceeded net charge-offs, but growth in certain loan portfolios contributed to a 1-basis-point decrease in our ALLL ratio to 1.59%. Non-performing loans held for investment as a percentage of total loans decreased 1 basis point linked-quarter, but increased 3 basis points on a like quarter basis to 47 basis points. NPLs have remained in a fairly narrow band of 44 basis points to 48 basis points over the course of the past five quarters. Included in our appendix is updated data on our office portfolio, which is down $235 million linked-quarter and represented 1.5% of total loans. Our office reserve increased from 10.4% to 11.1%. Approximately 5.3% of our office portfolio is currently classified as non-performing compared with 5.1% at September 30. Notably, approximately 18% of our office portfolio is housed within our commercial community banking and wealth segments where loan sizes tend to be more granular, guarantor support more prevalent, and overall losses lower. We expect stress to remain in the office sector and believe that the size of our portfolio is manageable and well reserved, but our position is to remain very proactive in identifying and resolving issues in this portfolio. So turning now to capital on Slide 15. On a linked-quarter basis, our CET1 ratio declined 10 basis points to 11.5% due to the payout of 98% of our earnings via our common dividend and $500 million of share repurchases, as well as balance sheet growth. Our CET1 capital ratio, including the impact of AOCI, decreased from 9.9% to 9.6%, reflecting the aforementioned factors and an increase in AOCI due to the increase in longer-term interest rates experienced during the quarter. During 2024, our CET1 ratio increased by 140 basis points, which was driven by the sale of Truist Insurance Holdings and retained earnings, partially offset by our strategic balance sheet repositioning, our common dividend, and $1 billion of share repurchases. We continue to believe that our strong capital position gives us the unique ability to utilize our future earnings and AOCI accretion to fund balance sheet growth and to return significant amount of capital to our shareholders. Now, I will move Slide 16, and review our guidance for 2025. Looking into the first quarter of 2025, we expect revenue to decrease 2% relative to fourth-quarter revenue of $5.1 billion. We expect net interest income to decrease 2% in the first quarter, primarily driven by two fewer days in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter and seasonally lower average deposit balances. This will be partially offset by slightly higher average loan balances. Excluding the impact of day count, we would expect net interest income to remain relatively stable linked-quarter. We expect noninterest income to decrease 2.5%, driven primarily by higher investment banking and trading revenue, partially offset by lower other income and service charges on deposits. Adjusted expenses of $3 billion in the fourth quarter, which includes CDI amortization expense, are expected to decline by 3% linked-quarter as seasonally higher personnel expenses will be offset with lower other expenses and professional fees. As it relates to the buyback, similar to the fourth quarter, we're targeting approximately $500 million of share repurchases in the first quarter of 2025. For full year 2025, we expect revenue to increase by 3% to 3.5% relative to 2024 adjusted revenue of $20.1 billion, driven by growth in net interest income and noninterest income. Our net interest income outlook assumes a low-single-digit end-of-period loan growth and two reductions in the Fed funds rate, including a cut in March, and another in September. We expect non-interest income to increase at a low single-digit rate. This expected growth rate reflects the fact that certain fee revenues that were recognized in 2024, will not reoccur in 2025. These fees are related to the shared services agreement that was in place following the sale of TIH back in May, and six months of revenue associated with Sterling Capital Management, which was also sold around mid-year last year. We expect full-year 2025 adjusted expenses, which includes CDI amortization expense to increase approximately 1.5% in 2025 versus 2024. Our 2025 revenue and expense outlook implies positive operating leverage of 150 basis points to 200 basis points. In terms of asset quality, we expect net charge-offs of about 60 basis points in 2025, which is stable compared with net charge-offs of 59 basis points in 2024. Finally, we expect our effective tax rate to approximate 17% or 20% on a taxable equivalent basis in 2025. I'll now hand it back to Bill for some final remarks. Bill Rogers : Thanks, Mike. So to conclude, I'm really pleased with the progress we made as a company last year, and I'm confident that we have strong momentum with clients and with teammates in this year as our value proposition has just never been stronger. First, we have an incredible franchise with leading share in high-growth markets. We've got motivated and energized teammates and a fulsome set of specialized wholesale and consumer capabilities that our loyal clients value. Second, our relative capital position remains a differentiating factor that gives us the ability to grow our core business, by serving existing and new clients, invest in our infrastructure and return considerable amounts of capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the next several years, all of which we plan to continue doing in 2025. Third, as we execute our strategic growth and capital management priorities, we see a significant opportunity to improve our profitability over the medium-term and we would expect to show progress in 2025. Our path to profitability improvement is multifaceted and a function of client and business growth while maintaining our cost discipline. As I discussed earlier, much of the profitability improvement potential we plan is centered on further deepening of existing client relationships in verticals and product lines like wealth, payments, premier, and investment banking that already exist at Truist. We see opportunities to grow in markets, where we have less dominant share like New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and particularly Texas, while also further penetrating the middle-market lending segment. The good news is that we see multiple paths and initiatives that with proper execution will result in improved performance, which we expect to show you in 2025. Fourth, we plan to accomplish all of this while maintaining our expense discipline, generating positive operating leverage in 2025 and beyond while also continue to invest in talent, technology and our infrastructure. Finally, we never take for granted our strong track record on asset quality as we'll continue to focus on maintaining strong risk discipline and controls. I'm as optimistic as ever about Truist future, especially in light of the momentum, I see every day inside of this company. I'd like to thank all of our teammates and leaders for their incredible purposeful focus and productivity in moving our Company forward. I'm so proud to be their teammate. So again, thank you, for your interest and investment in Truist. And Brad, we'll turn it into Q&A. Brad Milsaps : Thank you, Bill. Betsy, at this time, will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session? As you do that, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary question and one follow-up in order that we may accommodate as many of you as today as possible. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Scott Siefers : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Mike, I appreciate the disclosures on the swap book and the anticipated repricing opportunities this year. Kind of, it sounds like, after a little bit of a step back in the first quarter, there's just a lot of programmatic opportunity. So maybe just in sort of simple terms, maybe if you could discuss how much of the building momentum simply sort of happens versus how much you see is dependent on the external rate environment? I guess, in particular, in there, maybe how your thoughts would change if we got either more or fewer cuts than the two you've envisioned in the guidance? Mike Maguire : Yes. Good morning, Scott. Happy to do that. I think about our NII trajectory and you hit it, I think the first quarter, we're going to experience a little bit of a step back and that's really just day count driven. But from there, we would expect to begin to see positive trend. And some of that is sort of a continuous expectation that we'll begin to see end-of-period balance growth occur throughout the course of the year, again, relatively modest. The betas on the deposit side are catching up, essentially will become fully caught up in the first quarter. So we really do begin to see, I think, some benefit there. And I think as we came into the cutting cycle, that was maybe more of a question around where these betas might start. We're very pleased by the 40% that we were able to achieve in the first quarter or, pardon me, the fourth quarter, and have an expectation that we'll be in the mid 40%s plus in the first on our way to 50% next year. So I think that's the primary drivers of our outlook for next year are just that, some modest loan and deposit growth, coupled with the fact that the betas are where they are. In terms of the Fed rate path, we've got the two cuts in now in March and September. I think if we were to see later cuts, fewer cuts, even no cuts, that would present a touch of a headwind, but I think manageable, frankly, inside of our guide. To the extent that the short-end was a little lower and we saw maybe sooner cuts or more cuts. I think that's a touch of a good guy. But again, we do have, I think our sensitivity, at least to the short-end relatively neutral. I mean, one other factor that we're keeping our eye on, I think, like others, frankly, is just the shape of the curve. Today's curve is, I think, attractive. And to the extent that we can hang on to a long-end that does benefit the fixed loan and the securities repricing, that's something we have our eyes on as well. Scott Siefers : Perfect. Thank you for that color. And then within the sort of the loan balance comment, it -- so it sounds like fairly modest, positive but modest loan growth expected. Maybe just sort of some additional broader thoughts on kind of where your customers are? How you might expect that loan demand to evolve as the year progresses? Bill Rogers : Yes. Scott, it's Bill. As Mike noted, I mean we're not building a lot of loan growth into the forecast, but we're starting the year with some momentum. So sort of small single-digit end-of-period kind of loan growth. We're seeing is the benefit of our activity. So the things that we've been investing in and the opportunities that we see in our markets, which I think can fares recover a little bit faster than the rest of the country. So maybe like, if -- I'll just dissect it a little bit if that'll be helpful. So in the consumer side, our efforts in indirect auto, service finance, and mortgage led to the growth there and I expect those to continue. I mean, those are places where we're leaning in, as I said in my comments, also not compromising on price or structure or credit. So that's good. And on the C&I side, we saw some production increase in the fourth quarter, particularly at the end of the fourth quarter, utilization ticked up slightly, but I'll just say slightly. And similarly, the commitments have gone up, the quality of the growth is significant, middle-market, significant production there, the quality of the things that we're doing in our Commercial segment or in our overall C&I segment sort of 50% increase in syndicated deals, half of those are new to Truist, half were left lead. So the things that we're focused on are working. So in addition to seeing a little bit of left uptick, I'm really probably most excited about the quality of what we're putting on and the accretive nature of those relationships long term. In terms of client sentiment as your question, I think clients are certainly more expansionary. I think that reflects in the commitment. So we've seen more increasing commitment. So I think clients are telling us that they're building for the future in terms of opportunities to invest. I think the real linchpin or the fulcrum point will come in M&A. So I think depending on how much M&A we see, I think we'll be an accelerate to anything that we might project. And today, that's a lot of dialog. We have to see that show-up and some more action, but a lot more dialogue around all that. Hope that was helpful, Scott. Scott Siefers : Yes. That's terrific. Bill and Mike, thank you guys very much. Bill Rogers : Great. Operator : The next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on Bill. I think I heard you a couple of times call out, in particular, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas. Just talk to us in terms of the growth opportunity set you see there. Should we expect new branch openings, hiring of teams? Or could these be markets that are attractive even from a bank M&A perspective? Bill Rogers : Yes. Let me sort of go into that. I mean, remember, these are markets that we've been in for over a decade in most cases. So this isn't new in terms of markets, but it is new in terms of investment and momentum and the things that we can offer those markets. So if you think about just the expansive nature of the products and capabilities, and then, we've just got great leaders, who are bringing those to the benefit of our clients. As far as new bankers, we're seeing that. I mean, in those markets, we've added about 25 new bankers to our existing platforms. People are attracted to this opportunity. In terms of production and fee income growth, I mean, they're big numbers off a smaller basis of 80%, 70% kind of activity. In those markets alone, sort of take Philadelphia and Texas, we did about $3.5 billion of loan production. So this is sort of new incremental on top of that. And in Texas, specifically, we added about 5,000 net new clients. So you can sort of see the impact of that. I do think you'll continue to see more expansion from us in there. So that's maybe more to come and more dialog this year as we think about the full network, not only in terms of bankers but in branches and other types of investments we're making in those markets. And I think in fairness to the last part of the question, I think that will be organic. I think we've got really good organic momentum. So I like the opportunities that we have there. The teams on the field are really strong, and areas that we're leaning into. Ebrahim Poonawala : That's helpful. And I guess just sticking with that theme across the Southeast, maybe remind us again in terms of you could still hear concerns around talent attrition in your markets from competitors. Just give us your sense of confidence level around that these two franchises have been meshed, you feel good about defending market share or potentially growing market share from here when we think about deposits in your sort of legacy [indiscernible] markets? Bill Rogers : Yes. I mean, you see that in the results. You see that in the quarter. I mean, we've had good momentum against the balance sheet. I talked about net new. So I do feel good about not only defending, but actually leaning into the markets that we serve in these fantastic markets. We've lost some teams and we've added some teams. I mean there's a reality of that of the size company that we are. We've added a lot of great talent. I mean our leaders have really done a fantastic job of attracting teams to the value proposition. So the teams that we have on the field and their capacity and ability to deliver against our value proposition has never been better. So we've added a lot. I feel really good. As I mentioned in my comments, our focus is going to be on attracting, developing and retaining great teammates, who can deliver against this Truist value proposition. So the answer is, we're in not just a defensive, but we're in an offensive position in our markets and fully prepared, and we see the results and momentum of that. Ebrahim Poonawala : Great to hear. Thanks, Bill. Operator : The next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Can you guys talk about how you're thinking about targeted capital levels over time? Obviously, there's still some potential changes coming on the regulatory side, including CCAR, but just without having all the details on that, just the thought process? And then also just related to that, are there other opportunities to tweak the preferred stock? You had some redemptions this quarter and, obviously, that impacts the business going forward. Thanks. Mike Maguire : Hey, good morning, Matt. Look, we recently talked about a longer-term target in the 10% area for CET1. I don't think we have an updated view on that thinking. Obviously, where we sit today with current rules and some expectation that there'll be changes to rules. We're at 11.5%. If you were to adjust that number for AOCI, we're kind of 9%, 6% area. So we're thinking about today's measurement, we're thinking about the likelihood of a new rule, and think still that sort of that 10% area is a reasonable expectation for you guys to have. Look, there's a lot in motion right now. And I think as we see more cards turn, there'll be an opportunity for us to maybe update our perspective if that's appropriate. On the Pref, we did -- we've done some liability management over the last couple of quarters. You'll see that continue on a total capital basis. We're in good shape. And so, just capturing some of that benefit where we see opportunity is really sort of what you saw there. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. That's helpful. And the 10%, I assume is including the AOCI? Mike Maguire : Yes. I think that's a perspective that the rule will evolve. Again, I think it would be difficult to speculate on all the various other impacts. There's been a lot of discussion around the impact on RWA inflation or otherwise. And -- but if you just were to think about OCI especially, that's what's driving my guide there. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then just squeezing in, what's the duration of the securities book? I know you had some adds this quarter or last two quarters. Mike Maguire : Yes. Matt O\u2019Connor: So what's the current duration and the [indiscernible]? Mike Maguire : Yes. The -- obviously, the AFS portfolio is shorter. Just given the work we did this spring with the repositioning. So on a net basis with the payers, our AFS durations in the low 3%s. Our HTM portfolio obviously is extended. It's closer to 7%, and on a net basis combined mid-4s. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Hi. Good morning. I guess my first question is for Bill. I know, clearly, there's a macro aspect to the return of lending growth, but -- and you have just modest assumptions in your net interest income outlook or revenue outlook. But maybe could you talk to us about how some of the growth might be impacted by some of the changes that you've made to leadership maybe, and like incentive comp and the way you go-to-market, because, clearly, there's a macro aspect to it, but there also seems to be a Truist specific aspect where you're sort of emerging from defense and offense. And to that end, you made some announcements in terms of leadership. I feel like that was received fairly well by investors, but perhaps some comments on you in terms of what message would you like us to take away from the changes in leadership that you announced this week? Bill Rogers : Yes. I mean you sort of went a couple of different attributaries there. But look, overall, when I said this, I think, in the answer to other question, I mean, the talent that we're investing in our teammates, who I think, can really lead this organization in the future, they really know our value proposition in terms of where we're going. And in terms of this week, I mean, we had Beau, departed our Company. I mentioned earlier, great career. He really did a lot of important things in terms of establishing the framework for the future. And then we took the opportunity to take some of those responsibilities and distribute them among some of my existing leaders. So that gives them some more opportunities to grow and some more opportunities to expand their toolkits. I feel really, really, really good about that. And then as you mentioned, there have been some other key important leadership hires along the way that I think will be important parts of our future. So I don't think there's a story there, other than we have a great franchise and we're attracting really good people to our franchise. We have existing teammates, who have really expanded their toolkits. We have great leaders, who really understand and know and how to attract and retain really, really strong talent. Mike Maguire : And Erika, maybe I'd just add to that a little bit. I mean, another dynamic, obviously is, post the sale of TIH, the capital position we find ourselves in, I think, also gives our teammates a lot of confidence. I mean, we have a very sort of pro-growth agenda and that's -- we're doing a lot of senior and banker hiring in our commercial and wholesale businesses, you're seeing that pull-through in terms of activity levels and we're trying to activate capital across our consumer lending platforms. And so those are very defensible, strong businesses that we think have good growth potential. So I think there's just a clarity of focus on growth in the client and you're starting to see that pull-through. And I think that's going to obviously, gives us a lot of confidence as we go into the year. And I think you're right, I think our expectations for low-single-digit growth are relatively modest. So we're just focused on execution. Erika Najarian : And the second question is a lot more boring. On Slide 11, on the $45 billion in active received fixed swaps by year-end, how does that progress quarterly through from 12/31/24 to 12/31/25? In terms of [indiscernible] traditional changing you have. Mike Maguire : Yes. Yes. It's -- so we're $45 billion in the fourth quarter. That stays relatively consistent in the first quarter. So I think it ticks up maybe we've got another $1 billion effective. In the second quarter and third quarter, I think you see a little bit of a step up and by the fourth, you're peaking at $63 billion. So I think you could probably model almost straight line, Erika, between kind of $46 billion and $60 billion. I think we see a touch more come on in the third, but -- and then $30 billion of payers are on for the whole year. So we're net $15 billion effective receive Q1, and think of it as net 30 receive effective Q4. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thanks. Mike Maguire : Which -- and just to say it as well as to get where you're going, if you think about sort of the impact on NII throughout the course of 2025, our expectation is it will actually be relatively stable because as you have more of the receivers coming on in kind of the mid 3%s, you're -- again, at least with our baseline view is pick up a cut sometime in the first half and again in the second half. And so, those factors really offset one another. So we see the hedge impact net relatively consistent throughout the course of 2025, and it's really not very different than what we saw in Q4 of 2024. Erika Najarian : Thank you. Got it. Operator : The next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Bill Rogers : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : I did want to just drill down into the expense outlook a little bit here. Maybe you could help us understand what's the driver behind the expense declines in the first quarter, Q-Q, down 3%? And then on the outlook for the full year, revenue growth 3% to 3.5%, expense growth only 1.5%. So help us understand how you're anticipating managing to that type of outcome, especially in an environment where capital markets is pretty strong and there's a comp payout ratio there. Thank you. Mike Maguire : Sure. For the quarter, the decline is just -- we had elevated professional fees in the fourth quarter. We had slightly higher other expense, some ops losses in the fourth quarter. So seeing those come off, that benefit might. So is some of the change there, Betsy. We would expect through -- after the increase in the first to begin to smooth out for the rest of the year. If you look at 2025, I think your question is, is there an expectation that maybe upside in capital markets might drive us higher on full-year expenses? I mean, certainly, the comp correlation with certain of our businesses does tend to be more variable in Wealth and Investment Banking. But we think that 1.5% level captures sort of the baseline outlook that we're providing to you. We'd be delighted to see revenue exceed our expectations based on higher market levels, activity levels and to see our expense outlook drift with it. Betsy Graseck : And embedded within [Multiple Speakers] Bill Rogers : Yes. Just to maybe add to that, Betsy. I mean, so, in that existing guidance, I mean, we've had really good consistent low double-digit kind of performance in Investment Banking, and I expect that to continue. So this is built into this. And we also continue to have efficiency points. So those are offset against those. So think about this year, we had the best year in Investment Banking and we were down 40 basis points in expenses. So this is an environment where we continue to have efficiencies against the investment, all oriented towards that consistency and the efficiency ratio and creating and sustaining positive operating leverage. So we don't want this to be a one-time thing. We want this to be a sustainable platform. So our teams look at the investment side and the savings side with the same level of intensity. Betsy Graseck : Yes. No. I totally get it. And it's a significant amount of operating leverage here at 1.5 percentage points at the low end of the range at 2 percentage points. So I was wondering if there's much in the way of recouping prior investment spend with tech getting turned off, et cetera, that's helping keep this expense outlook at 1.5% and keeping it from creeping up to 2% or 2.5%. I mean, that was -- Bill Rogers : A lot of these -- think about the strategy we've talked about, a lot of these are investments that we've already made. So if you think about in the merger, so we created a lot of opportunities in terms of new products and new capabilities, existing new consolidated platforms, et cetera, et cetera. And the crux of our strategic focus is expanding with existing clients. So these are products and capabilities in markets and places, where we've already invested and it's leveraging that investment. So it has by its nature high return sort of high ROA kind of components to it and really good leverage. Betsy Graseck : Great. Thanks so much. Bill Rogers : Yes. Operator : The next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead. John Pancari : Good morning. Bill Rogers : Hey, John. John Pancari : On the -- just real quick back to the expense guide, I agree, lower than we would have forecasted. Could you just remind us what are the most material areas of investment that you flagged? What are the most meaningful that are impacting your expense outlook right now? And then given where this guide is, which is notably reasonable, like, do you have flexibility if revenue is weaker given this guide where it stands now? Thanks. Bill Rogers : Yes. So the primary investments on the expense side are some of the things we've talked about. So they're related -- some are directly related to the revenue side. So Investment Banking is one we talked about, has a direct correlation. Also, the continued investment in the risk infrastructure as we build out our Company. I mean, we're a bigger company and we're continuing to grow. So we have to have a strong risk infrastructure, strong cybersecurity structure. So those will continue to be growing investments. And then the toggles, we talked about the toggle on the upside and the toggle on the downside. I mean, we have a commitment to positive operating leverage. So if we -- Mike talked about earlier. If we toggle on the upside, that's one opportunity. And if we have to toggle on the downside, we know how to do that as well. Mike Maguire : Yes. John, I would just add. I mean we're hiring talent across the board right now. So whether it'd be in wealth or commercial or corporate or investment banking, we're hiring premier bankers, we're hiring area leaders, we're hiring people to go drive our growth agenda. We're also investing in products. We've talked a lot about the opportunity we believe we have. For example, in treasury, we're adding, we've invested in our trading capabilities in our investment bank, where you heard Bill talk about deepening our penetration in some of our markets, where we think we have an opportunity to do so. So, I think those are all areas where you're seeing some incremental growth. But just recall, and this is for Betsy too, like we're giving you a net number. I mean, the work we were doing in 2024 to manage expenses and drive efficiency continues in 2025. So we're looking at sourcing. We're looking at all the various levers you would expect us to be focused on to drive that outlook. And look, just to say it as well, just with the focus on operating leverage, we feel pretty good about the revenue outlook we've provided. We don't think we've got heroic loan growth in our outlook and we've got a pretty good curve. And so, we feel pretty good as we turn the page on 2024 and move into 2025. John Pancari : Great. All right. Thanks, Mike. And then just separately back to the capital front. I hear you in terms of the 10% CET1 target. You've already guided to about another quarter of $500 million in buybacks in the first quarter. Is that a reasonable pace as we look over the remainder of the year just given your current capital position or could that slow a bit if loan growth picks up more meaningfully than your modest assumption at this point? Bill Rogers : Yes. John, the good news is, we've got ample capital to sort of stay at that pace. So we're in the, I think, unique position that we can grow and distribute capital. So I think, we're, right now, on, let's call it short-term to medium-term, I think we anticipate staying at that pace in terms of the share buyback. We'd love to have dramatic loan growth that would change that. But the good news is that we can accommodate a good level of loan growth and we can accommodate share buybacks. So I think we're in a really good position to ensure the future of our Company and reward shareholders along the way. John Pancari : Got it. Okay. Great. Thanks, Bill. Operator : The next question comes from Saul Martinez with HSBC. Please go ahead. Saul Martinez : Hey, good morning, guys. First of all, just wanted to clarify the revenue guidance of 3%, 3.5%. I think the non-interest income guide is low-single-digits, which, I assume, is 1% to 3%, which would imply NII growth is a little bit above that range. Is that right? I might be stating the obvious, but I just wanted to clarify nonetheless. Mike Maguire : No, you've got it right. The -- maybe a couple of things on that. The NII guide in our outlook is better headline than fees. But I did mention in the prepared remarks and it's worth mentioning again, the transactions that we completed last year, the sale of TIH and the related transition services agreement that we entered into and which generated at least in 2024, some temporary fee income and then the sale of Sterling, which is in the 2024 numbers, but, of course, wouldn't be in the 2025 numbers, that does impact that headline fee income outlook, right? So we're guiding with those items in 2024. So I think if you were to exclude those items that won't reoccur in 2025, our fee outlook would actually like on the core businesses be more like a mid-single digit outlook. Saul Martinez : Got it. So on a core basis, it's more mid-single digits. Okay. And, I guess a follow-up question. Fixed-rate loans, $42 billion running off at a yield of 6.36%, which is higher than the portfolio yield. It seems to imply some of the higher-margin loans are rolling off. But what is the -- what's -- how do we think about the new money rates on that $42 billion? What kind of an incremental spread are we getting there? Mike Maguire : I think on a -- we're not changing our mix, we're not changing our risk appetite. So I don't want to imply that there's a change in like the core spread. But if you're looking at the run-on yield versus the run-off yield, I think you've got with today's curve, 100 basis points or better run on rate for the fixed-rate loans versus the run-off rate. And on the bonds, that's better. Saul Martinez : Okay. Got it. So that's -- I mean, doing the math, it's like $400 million more or less on that $42 billion annualized. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Due to time constraints, please limit yourself to one question. The next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Fine. So, I guess for a couple of years during the merger, you lost some market share in the Southeast. And now you're going -- you've been on more offense and I was surprised to hear you mentioned Pennsylvania and New Jersey when it looks like you have so much opportunity in the Southeast. So I'm just trying to figure out why you mentioned those markets specifically now, what's changed? And what are the mechanics in terms of turning the corner in terms of that core deposit market share, whether it's in the Southeast or Pennsylvania, New Jersey? And I get it, it's all included in your expense guide. So if you're doing a lot more marketing or branch builds or hiring, it's all in that expense number which we got, but maybe if you could just unpack that a little bit, how you get from the investments to the execution of better deposit share in those markets? Thank you. Bill Rogers : Yes. Mike, you saw some of the deposit growth this quarter and some of the momentum that we see on that. So we're in a -- when you do a merger, we've exceeded what people have told us sort of how the market share challenges are from a merger. And we're, I feel, like a really strong pivot in those markets in terms of product capability and opportunities that exist there. So I think we're making good progress on that front. And then you mentioned, so why do you mention Texas and why do you mention these other markets? They're also our markets. So these are not -- these are places where we've been for a long time and we're continuing to expand. And I mentioned those just in the sense of -- there's also opportunities to gain really disproportionately and quickly. So not only defend and grow, but also be offensive and grow in other markets on the incremental side. So just -- it's just a function of trying to paint the whole picture of what Truist looks like. Mike Mayo : I guess just -- from your decades of experience, Bill, I mean, are the banking battles heating up? It just seems like everybody is going into everybody else's backyard to compete. On the other hand, the crazies are off the street from before the financial crisis. So what's the competitive dynamics right now? Is it intense? Is it good? Is it rationale? Bill Rogers : Since you pointed to my decades of experience, so the decades of my experience have always been in really good markets, and those markets have always been really competitive. So I don't think it's particularly different in the sense that they've always been really competitive. We have smart players in our markets. I think that's an advantage because we're one of the smart players as well. I think our capacity and ability to compete has never been better. So I think we're positioned really well, but good markets are highly competitive. I mean, that's the advantage of being at them. And they grow disproportionately faster. So you can be competitive in a market and continue to grow, and that's what I think we see in terms of that opportunity. So I don't -- I think -- I don't think we see, I guess you used the term, but I don't think we see crazy pricing. I don't think we see unreasonable competition. As I said, we have really smart large competitors, and we have a really strong value proposition to win and you see that. You see that net-new is like one of the primary examples, but you see our capacity to win against those competitors. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Bill Rogers : Yes. Thanks, Mike. Operator : The last question today comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Hi, Bill. Hi, Mike. Can you guys share with us -- you've had real success in the Investment Banking business and I think it represents now about 21% of your fee revenues in 2024, up from 15% in 2023. And as a percentage of total revenues, it's now about 9% versus about 4%. Can you share with us, where you see that going? Are you comfortable at these levels relative to the total pie? Or can you grow it further where it could get to 15% maybe of total revenues? Or -- kind of curious on how you're looking for the growth opportunities? Bill Rogers : Yes. Gerard, just -- thank you for the acknowledgment of the strength of the Investment Banking business. I mean, this has been an organic build over long periods of time. We have had sort of a consistent low double-digit kind of CAGR over time, and I think we can continue to be at that pace. So, I feel really good about that. As we've talked about in the past, our business also is really predicated on a middle-market focus and it's predicated on a focus on our existing client base. So I also see the opportunity for less volatility over time, because we're focused on our clients and our capability to expand into that. Really good return characteristics. So we also run the business well. It's an efficient business. It's a really smart user of capital in terms of its strategy. So I think we can continue to grow this business as being a part of it. We also want the rest of the business, payments, wealth, all those other components to also grow. So we don't get disproportionate in any place, because that diversity of fee income and that diversity of balance sheet are also important to the overall equation. So a little bit steady as she goes. We're not putting the governor on that business because we see the opportunities and we like the way that it's built in terms of its efficient operation, really good use of capital, and strategic focus against Truist as a whole. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And I forgot to mention if Clarke is sitting in the room, congratulations on your retirement. Good luck. Thank you, Bill. Bill Rogers : Well, thanks for that. Thanks for that great comment about Clarke, and well deserved as you know. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brad Milsaps for any closing remarks. Brad Milsaps : Okay. Thank you. That completes our earnings call. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team. Thank you for your interest in Truist. And we hope you have a great day. Betsy, you may now disconnect the call. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
