During the question-and-answer portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, our Executive Vice President of Acquisitions and Development, and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Mort Zuckerman for his formal remarks. Mortimer B. Zuckerman: Good morning, everybody. This is Mort Zuckerman speaking. There's a little bit of construction job going on behind me, so you're going to hear a little bit of noise, somebody breaking up the sidewalk, but in fact that is a noise that we have always enjoyed in a way because that's what we do. We basically have had a long-term strategy, which we continue to focus on, of building long-term values and assets that we can hold for the long-term because we believe they will appreciate over the long-term. And we try and create a certain core value in terms of being at the very upper end of the quality of the assets in each market that we are in. And we are involved, therefore, in 2 things. One is maintaining and owning for the long-term a lot of investment assets, which we can go over. But the ones that really continue to grow the company are through the development programs that we have always had on our agenda and which we have today in a very strong way. In all of our markets virtually, Atlantic Wharf, block 5, 601 Mass Avenue. And the ones that have gotten the most attention recently are 535 Mission Street in San Francisco, where the activity is very strong and where we believe we will be creating significant value and a long-term investment pool [ph]; and Transbay in San Francisco as well, which is probably the most challenging and attractive opportunity that we have had, where we're building a 1,400,000 square-foot building. Both on the 535 Mission Street where we have a very strong activity, we've signed leases for over 80,000 square feet and we have very strong activity that is on the verge of being expressed in signed leases. And with the Transbay, as we call it, although we're now going to rename the building, we have had a very good experience in terms of having a signed lease now with a tenant who's going to take slightly over 50% of the building and the space that we will have remaining will be the upper sectors of the building, all of -- every floor which will have great views and great identity. And I do believe that, that building will be the iconic building in San Francisco for generations to come since it is going to be a couple of hundred feet taller than any other building. It's going to have great views and will become, we believe and hope, the iconic building that will symbolize San Francisco and its reemergence as one of the great innovative cities in America. I could go through a lot of other dimensions of our business, but I'll just mention that again, the long-term strategy of having high-rise, high-quality, highest-quality where we can, buildings in every aspect of our business continues to pay dividends. In that we are continuing to lease up whatever limited amount of space we have. The large tenants in those kinds of buildings, simply -- we do not have the space for them, but we have a lot of smaller tenants. And those buildings, therefore, are constantly being filled up in the niche spaces that we have remaining. And we're, frankly, very pleased with the performance of all of our, in particular, heads of the different regions. We'll be covering that in detail, but I think you'll come to the conclusion that we are still in a very difficult environment, which I think we are in on a macro basis, continuing to do well. Partly, of course, it is because we've specifically focused in on certain markets, Washington, New York, Boston and San Francisco, all of whom have the kind of urban ingredients, particularly those capacities and attributes that attract high-tech, high-quality companies into those markets. And so we've been able to participate in the growth of those cities in terms of the kinds of tenants who want to go into the very best buildings, and those continue to work for us. I'm not going to go through every development that we have on our agenda, but I think you will get a feel from it as we go through our different offices. But suffice it to say that in the area of the city -- of the country rather, that we made our biggest commitment, which was San Francisco, we landed Salesforce for a 714,000 square foot lease and we're doing extraordinarily well in 535 Mission. And as you will hear, through the reports that we make, we're continuing with development in our various markets, not only developments that we have underway, but developments that we are working on and planning for the future. So that we can continue to grow the company in the context of what is clearly and may continue to be, and I believe it will continue to be, a much more sluggish economy than most people have been predicting. Although I have to say we have been kind of very conservative about our estimates of how the macroeconomy will work. But we believe we're in the best markets for office space and we have the best buildings in these markets and we are continuing to build and develop in these markets, and lease up our space and keep our buildings at the cutting edge of quality. So with that, if I may, I'll just end my comments and turn it back over to Owen, if you don't mind, Owen. Owen D. Thomas: Okay. Thank you, Mort. Good morning, everyone. This is Owen Thomas. I'll touch briefly on the operating environment, building on some of the remarks that Mort made, and also I'll touch on our overall performance for the first quarter. I'll then provide an update on our capital allocation strategy and execution. Doug's then going to discuss our markets and operational performance and we'll finish up with Mike LaBelle who will provide more color on our financial results for the first quarter. So starting with the environment, which Mort touched on. I think demonstrated by this morning's weak and likely weather-related GDP numbers, the U.S. economy continues to experience, in the aggregate, uneven growth characteristics. Though I do think overall business sentiment seems to be improving slightly. Traditional tenants are not growing rapidly. And in selected cases, they are reducing their space needs. However, this has been counterbalanced by explosive growth in many creative industries that we serve, such as technology and life sciences. As a company, we continue to experience very favorable market conditions in San Francisco, Cambridge, suburban Boston and, to some degree, Midtown Manhattan. Overall employment in Washington, D.C., however, continues to be reliant on government-related and legal industry. And we've not yet seen a strong catalyst for incremental demand in that market. Switching to performance highlights. In the first quarter, we had several significant accomplishment. Mort touched on this as well, but certainly the most exciting news for our company in the quarter was the execution of a 714,000 square-foot lease with salesforce.com at the now renamed Salesforce Tower in San Francisco. With the salesforce.com lease, we've now agreed to commence the full development of this 1.4 million square-foot tower at a total cost, including capitalized interest, of $1.1 billion. You recall, in our efforts to manage the risk of this large scale development, we were seeking to secure an anchor tenant and considering introducing a joint venture capital partner. With a large anchor tenant now secured, we are no longer considering a joint venture capital partner to complete the development. Now more broadly in our portfolio, we executed 97 leases, representing 1.6 million square feet, with the Boston and New York regions being the largest contributors. Our in-service properties in the aggregate are now 92.4% leased, down 100 basis points from 93.4% leased at year end. This reduction is due primarily to the forecast tenant rollover at 101 Huntington, a space that has already been re-leased, but will have downtime until early 2015. Further in the quarter, we also continue to make progress leasing our remaining development pipeline, which Doug will get into in greater detail. And in terms of operating performance for the quarter, we were slightly below our FFO forecast, due primarily to weather-related expenses. So we are modestly increasing the bottom of our guidance range for full year 2014, and Mike will cover these items in greater detail in his remarks. Now turning to capital strategy. As all of you know, interest rates actually declined over the last quarter and year-to-date. Specifically year-to-date, the 10-year U.S. Treasury has dropped 30 basis points, approximately, to 2.7%. And the prospects for rising interest rates appear to be more benign, at least in the short to medium term. Private capital for real estate in our core markets remains plentiful, and if anything, has gotten more aggressive over the last quarter as evidenced by specific completed transactions. Our capital strategy remains consistent with what we have been communicating to you over the last several quarters. First, we have and we'll continue to actively pursue acquisitions. But, as mentioned, we continue to find the market very competitive. Notwithstanding this environment, year-to-date, we have made a small number of targeted acquisition proposals, totaling just under $250 million, on buildings in our core markets, and several of these situations remain fluid. Second, given the robust private capital market, we continue to actively monetize assets. In 2013, as you know, we sold $1.25 billion in total assets and expect our monetization activity to be at least $1 billion for 2014. Assets that we've targeted for disposition are in 1 of 2 categories : they are either buildings that are non-core to our ongoing business strategy; or assets where we believe the investment market will aggressively underwrite future growth prospects. In terms of our current sales pipeline, we've received an unsolicited offer to buy a portion of our Mountain View single-story product and we are in active negotiations. We are also in discussions with a purchaser for The Avenue, our Class A apartment building in Washington, D.C. The outcome of these negotiations is unclear at the moment. We're also in the market with Patriots Park, which is a 706,000 square-foot suburban office building located in Reston, Virginia, which is 100% leased on a long-term basis to the GSA. Lastly, we're exploring a recapitalization of Carnegie Center in Princeton, and considering JVs on several additional assets. Now, lastly on capital strategy. As discussed in prior quarters, and Mort touched on this as well, we continue to make the vast majority of our new investments in development. In our core markets, we are at that point in the real estate cycle where new properties can be delivered at lower cost per square foot and higher yields than where existing older properties are trading. With the delivery of The Avant, a 359-unit apartment building in Reston, Virginia, and the commencement of full development of the Salesforce Tower, our active development pipeline now consists of 7 projects with a total projected cost of $3.2 billion, up from $2.5 billion at year end. Further, as described last quarter, we are in the predevelopment stage on another set of projects with strong potential. And these include North Station and 888 Boylston in Boston, a residential building at Kendall Square, 10 and 20 CityPoint in Waltham, additional sites in Reston and 501 K Street in Washington, D.C. In the aggregate, our share of these projects represents an additional future pipeline of over $1.5 billion in gross development cost. Lastly, a quick note on a personnel matter. Mickey Landis announced his retirement from Boston Properties in the last quarter, and we are very appreciative of Mickey's many contributions as the leader of our Princeton office during his 16 years with our company. With that, let me turn the discussion over to Doug. Douglas T. Linde: Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. It's Doug Linde speaking. I want to start off with a couple of comments on Transbay and put a little bit of meat on the bone, so you have a perspective of what's going on there. Interestingly, it was about a year ago that we actually announced the 95-5 JV with Heinz, we're the 95% obviously. And you may remember, there were many, many questions from investors and analysts regarding what our plans were, how much pre-leasing would we need and when would we start the building on spec. And I think we were noncommittal and vague, to put it mildly. But we basically said, look, we like the market, we think the market is going to get better. And lo and behold, we're now sitting here with a building under construction with a 714,000 square-foot lease. So as soon as we released the news a few weeks ago that we had signed that lease, lo and behold, we started getting lots of questions about the size of the Salesforce commitment and were we concerned about Salesforce. So we actually have spent a lot of time with the Salesforce leadership, and Mike and his team have done a very thorough credit analysis, and so I actually have asked Mike to spend a few minutes about Salesforce and their business in his remarks so we can hopefully provide a little bit of color on what they do and how we think about them and what the issues are regarding their commitment to the building. We've included the total cost of the Salesforce Tower in our supplemental materials, and it's about an $800-a-square-foot development. That includes an imputed cost of equity and debt, which is our typical method for quoting our development return and our yields on cost. But in fact, it actually overstates the overall cost. So the cost is going to, at the end of the day, be lower than that on a GAAP basis when we actually close our books on the transaction. Salesforce is going to be accepting space in various blocks, commencing in April of 2017, and their final block is going to be delivered in October of 2018. So at that point, in 2018, the annualized rent that Salesforce will be paying on that entire block of space will be in the low 50s. We expect to achieve a higher return and a higher rent on the remainder of the available space, which, again, is $432 and above, and we expect that our pro forma cash return on -- again on that $1.1 billion, will be in excess of 7%. Again, the rents that I just quoted are what the starting rent will be and in San Francisco, the market typically has either $1 or $1.05 bumps, or 1% to 3% bumps per year on those leases. So again, on a GAAP basis, the numbers will be higher than what they are on a cash basis. It has really been a pretty extraordinary beginning to the year in San Francisco in 2014. We had Twitter and Dropbox and EverBrite [ph] and Practice Fusion and Bare Essentials and Trulia and Salesforce all expand. And with the recent announcement that LinkedIn has signed a lease at 222 Second, all of the competing new construction pipeline has been committed, with the exception of 420,000 square feet at our 181 Fremont, which has a 13,000 square-foot floorplate. So it's a building more suited to the demand that we're seeing at 535 Mission. And then there's been a recent announcement that Lincoln Properties is supposed to start construction at 330 Bush, which is a 370,000 square-foot building, just on the backside of 555 Cal, off of Kearny Street and Bush, more in the north financial district. The San Francisco CBD continues to be, obviously, the strongest market -- urban market in our portfolio. And it's really this growth in tech that is expanding into traditional office buildings that's leading the growth and the strength in the market. We still have Pinterest and First Republic and Splunk and Uber were all in the market looking for over 100,000 square feet or more. The pace of activity in '14 is ahead of where it was in '13 and in '12, and there are also a lot of traditional users who are now conducting searches as the wave of lease expirations between 2015 and 2017 hit the market. Now those aren't necessarily expansions, but there are likely to be some musical chairs and some movements and we hope the Transbay -- the Salesforce Tower, excuse me, is going to be the beneficiary of much of those tenants. As Mort said, we signed our first lease at 535 Mission with Trulia for 84,000 square feet and they are at the base of that building and will be moving in, in the fourth quarter of 2014, so less than 6 months from now. We have strong interest from single and multi-floor users and we expect to sign our next lease in a few days. We are about 15% above our pro forma rents, which were in the mid-40s triple net, and we are again projecting a low 7% return on cost. Here the cost is about $700 a square foot. Just to give you a reference point, the last major sale in San Francisco was 101 Second, which sold for $767 a square foot, a sub-4% NOI return. Activity at Embarcadero Center is pretty limited, given that we're 95% occupied. We did about 7 deals this quarter, totaling 50,000 square feet and a few more over the last few days in April to add 20,000 square feet of additional leasing. We continue to market the 3 full view floors at EC4, those are at the top of the building. And while we're in discussions with a few tenants there now, we don't expect any 2014 revenue impact. Most of the tenants will have rent commencements in 2015. Net rents in our second-generation statistics in the supplemental show an increase of about 18% on leases that commenced during the quarter, which is in line with what we've anticipated, which is about a 15% to 25% markup on any individual lease. Down in the valley, our activities in Mountain View have continued to be very strong. At Mountain View Research, we've signed 169,000 square-foot of tenants, rents in excess of $32 triple net, and we have another 60,000 square feet in active negotiation. And we've leased all of the available space at our El Camino office building in Mountain View where rents are over $43 triple net. Activity at Zanker Road in North San Jose, however, has been limited. And that's where our largest availability is today, which is 437,000 square feet. Shifting to DC. We purchased a 50% interest in a future development site at 501 K Street from the Stuart [ph] family and we have commenced design and permitting on a 520,000 square-foot office building. We've actually taken a different approach to the building by responding to the high-performance workspace needs of both the traditional D.C. users, i.e. law firms and GSA, but also technology and non-law firm users, by adding large collaborative gathering areas throughout the building. We have 4 or 5 different 2-story spaces that we've been able to create, which could or couldn't be used depending upon the various uses of the tenant, but really make the building a different kind of building. The city is aware that it needs to expand its job generator, and we are designing a product that might attract this new user. We are also moving forward with the permitting of a 276,000 square-foot office retail building in the urban core of Reston Town Center, the strongest market in the Reston area and the strongest market in the D.C. area. As well as 2 additional residential buildings, which have about 25,000 square feet of additional retail space that'll tie right into our Reston Town Center retail. That's the site that we purchased last year, called the Signature site. The earliest construction commencement will be in the third quarter of 2015 for any of these new Reston transactions. We are in the midst of leasing at the Avant in Reston, which opened in December, and as of the end of last week, we have leased 100 out of the 359 units there. The bulk of our D.C. regional growth has been concentrated in Reston, which continues, as I said, to be the strongest submarket in the region. Our largest near-term lease in Reston is a rollover with the GSA and they've already notified us that they intend to extend that 251,000 square feet lease which expires 12/31/2014. We're in this awkward position of having 4 million square feet of office space and no inventory. We actually have a few tenants within the portfolio that have, for various reasons, put some sublet space on the market and much of our activity is actually responding to inquiries on this space from tenants that are interested in direct deals or subextensions. Again, rents in Reston are $15 to $25 per square foot above what you can get on other buildings on the toll route. The downsizing of the legal firms in the GSA densification continues to be an issue in the D.C. market. We've talked about it before and we'll continue to talk about it. We have limited 2014 exposure, but we do anticipate some churn in our D.C. assets with large law firms that have entered into discussions with -- and we've entered into discussions with our legal customers for our 2015 to 2019 expirations, about some space take-backs and long-term renewals. Some of these transactions could affect our earnings in prior years to the actual lease expiration, a.k.a. potentially next year, 2015. I also want to reiterate that what we discussed last quarter, which was 8% of our total company NOI comes from the CBD D.C. portfolio. The majority of our Washington, D.C. regional NOI is generated in Reston. The CBD portfolio continues to be 95% leased. Turning to New York. Our first quarter New York City activity on the in-service portfolio was really a continuation of what we've been seeing over the last year. We completed 24 transactions, totaling 537,000 square feet in our operating portfolio; which, by the way, now includes Princeton, and there were 3 deals in Princeton totaling 239,000 square feet. We did 7 more deals at 510 Madison during the quarter and we are currently in lease negotiations with 2 more tenants on 2 full floors and 2 more pre-built suites. If we complete these deals, knock on wood, which we hope to do, we will have 1 available full floor. It will be 95% leased at 510 Madison. The information in our supplemental, by the way, only shows leases that have actually commenced, which is why the numbers are a little bit different. Rent doesn't necessarily commence until 2015 on some of these floors, so much of the leasing we're doing right now really won't impact our 2014 revenues. At 540 Madison, we've completed 3 more deals, leaving only 33,000 square feet of availability at the base of the building. Demand from the high-end financial services firms continues into 2014, which is what Owen was referring to when he said we were feeling good about the Midtown market. And the fact that spaces are becoming more limited allowing us to maintain or modestly increase our pricing on some of the smaller suites. We completed 3 office extensions at the General Motors Building this quarter, including one expansion in the upper third of the asset. In July, we'll be getting back the 26th floor and we intend on demolishing it and offering it on a full floor or a partial-floor basis. We are now documenting a 15-year extension with Apple taking their lease out until 2031 down at the retail. They will also be expanding their core - concourse space by adding some currently landlocked units that really are not in service, which may allow them to expand their selling area as well. Cartier is now open. In total, the retail space at the General Motors Building, including our stores on Madison Avenue, currently generates $61 million of revenue on 100,000 square feet, including the Apple concourse and the FAO's second floor and concourse spaces. FAO's lease expires in early 2017. Morrison & Foerster moved into physical occupancy at 250 West 55th a few weeks ago, in addition to a few pre-built tenants on the 16th floor. Last quarter, we reported the signing of our lease with Soros Fund Management. This quarter, we completed 5 more deals, totaling 55,000 square feet and last week we signed an 85,000 square-foot lease with Al Jazeera network for some of the ground floor space, the entire second floor and a tower floor. We have 4 additional transactions in lease negotiations, totaling another 25,000 square feet. To date, we've leased 721,000 square feet. And with the pending transactions, we get to 746,000 or 75% leased. We continue to have an active pipeline of 1- and 2-floor prospects that continue to tour the remaining space, as well as users that are looking at our few remaining pre-built suites. At Carnegie Center, we continue to gain both occupancy and extend leases. As I said, during the quarter, we did 3 more leases for 239,000 square feet. In New York City, not unlike D.C., we are actively engaged with a number of our large law firm tenants regarding space utilization, redesign and extension. We have 5 such discussions underway, which could involve transactions well before lease expirations in 2015 and beyond. In addition, we've received notice from Citibank that they are terminating 174,000 square feet at 601 Lexington Avenue in 2016 with the right -- and we have begun to market that space today. Our development activities in the Boston region are continuing to advance. At the Prudential Center, we are negotiating a lease with an anchor tenant for the base of 888 Wilson Street, our 365,000 square feet of office space on top of 60,000 square feet of new retail space at the Prudential shops. This is a $275 million project including all carry and land at current market value that we expect to commence in the third quarter. In addition, we're planning a complete renovation and modest extension of our quick serve food operation, a.k.a. our food court, and potentially adding a 17,000 square-foot second-story addition to a portion of our Boylston arcade. These 2 retail projects have a combined cost of the between $30 million and $40 million. We anticipate temporarily closing down portions of the retail during the latter parts of 2014 and most of '15, and that will impact our revenue and is built into our projection. In Waltham, we're negotiating an anchor lease for 10 and 20 CityPoint, our 446,000 square-foot two-phase development. 10 CityPoint is a 230,000 square-foot office building with 16,000 square feet of retail and a project cost of about $108 million and tenant will take more than half of the office space. Just down the street, we've completed entitlements for a 16,000 square-foot stand-alone retail building, with future residential or hotel capacity, that we're not planning on for a while. We have 2 restaurant leases under negotiation for that small -- what we refer to as the stack. While this is a small $12 million project, it's an important element in creating a stronger amenity base and sense of community for CityPoint; where we currently have 516,000 square feet of existing office space, over 1.2 million square feet of additional office density, including 10 and 20 CityPoint, as well as our other 1.3 million square feet of existing assets at this critical interchange in Waltham, Massachusetts. In Cambridge, we're busy designing our new residential building, likely to start in the first or second quarter of 2015. In addition, we have -- to our new residential project, we're working with the city on our 600,000 square feet of additional office density and 400,000 square foot of residential density at other sites in Cambridge Center. In the meantime, we've completed additional early renewals at 5 Cambridge Center and 10 Cambridge Center, totaling 223,000 square feet. The combined markup on these leases is 50% on a net basis. In the Back Bay, we completed 50 -- 90,000 square feet of renewals at the Hancock Tower and 82,000 square feet of renewals at the Prudential Center during the quarter. And over the last few weeks, we've completed another 140,000 square feet of long-term relocations and renewals at the Hancock Tower. The suburban office market continues to be really active as Owen suggested. Large blocks of space have disappeared, forcing larger tenants to consider new construction such as our anchor tenant at 10 and 20 CityPoint. Rents in Waltham were up another 10% during the last few months, and are over $40 a square foot for any new construction. We completed 290,000 square feet of leases in Waltham and Lexington this quarter, and we continue to see strong activity in our Waltham assets with much of it continuing to be from expanding life sciences and tech companies. You might have noticed the negative second quarter stat in our supplemental for Boston, and this -- there is a simple explanation for this. Included in these figures is a 75,000 square foot 10-year lease extension that we actually completed in 2010, at 111 Huntington Avenue, that's just commencing. If you eliminate that transaction, the net goes from a negative 13% to a positive 4%. So as Owen stated, as we head into 2014, our investment activities continue to be focused on our active development pipeline. It was a great, great quarter in advancing our development activities, and we look forward to additional announcements in the quarters ahead. I will end my formal remarks and I'll turn the call over to Mike. Michael E. LaBelle: Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. As Doug mentioned and Owen mentioned, we're delighted with the opportunity to expand our relationship with a tenant of the quality of salesforce.com. Whenever we're engaged with a prospective tenant, we conduct a thorough credit review to ensure our comfort with the ability of the tenant to perform over the term of the lease and with our tenant-specific capital investment. In the case of salesforce.com, we have a company that has matured into a force in the customer relationship management software business. CRM software is utilized by companies to manage their sales process, client communication and marketing. It's an integral component of sales platforms. It creates a sticky annuity-like revenue stream for companies like salesforce.com. And salesforce.com has increased its market share significantly over the past few years and is now a clear leader in the industry. They have hundreds and -- hundreds of thousands of unique customers across the globe. The company's sales have been growing at a 30% annual clip and last year totaled $4 billion, with revenue guidance given for next year of over $5 billion. Although GAAP profitability is below breakeven, as they reinvest in R&D and they're growing their headcount, the free cash flow has been growing and is in excess of $500 million a year, and they maintain a strong balance sheet. As we track the leasing activity in San Francisco, many of the technology companies that are driving the demand for office space are more mature, higher-credit companies, which we think bodes well for the continued strength of the office market. In addition to companies like salesforce.com and LinkedIn, whose expansions have been widely covered, others, including Google, Adobe, Autodesk, Macys.com, Riverbed, Trulia, Amazon, athenahealth and Visa have also expanded in the city. Clearly, there continue to be startups and other early-stage companies in the market as well, but the plethora of more mature companies differentiates this cycle from past cycles. During the first quarter, we repaid our $747 million of exchangeable notes and paid a special dividend of $2.25 per share. Our cash position is now $1.2 billion and is the primary source for the funding of our growing development pipeline. With the addition of the full cost for Salesforce Tower, our development pipeline now stands at $3.2 billion, with $1.4 billion of cost remaining to fund over the next few years. With our strong cash position, we do not anticipate raising additional debt or equity capital this year, although as Owen mentioned, raising capital through asset sales remains likely. We do expect to extend and reload our ATM equity program this quarter as it expires in June, although we have no immediate plans to use it. As our development pipeline comes into service over the next few years and we gain the revenue contribution from the assets, our operating cash flow will grow significantly. Our portfolio continues to demonstrate strong performance, with first quarter same-store cash NOI up by 5.6% and GAAP NOI up by 2.3% from the first quarter last year. The improvement is the cost of portfolio and is the result of free rent burning off on a few large leases, as well as over 60 basis points of portfolio occupancy improvement, mostly in Boston and New York City. As we anticipated and discussed on our last call, our occupancy dipped slightly from last quarter to 92.4% today due to the move-outs that Owen mentioned in Boston, as well as Lockheed Martin moving out of 165,000 square feet at Zanker Road in North San Jose. Turning to our earnings. We reported funds from operations for the quarter of $1.20 per share, which was $0.01 below the low end of our guidance range. Our revenues were in line with our expectations. The driver of the variance was approximately $2 million of higher utilities and snow removal expense related to the unusually cold winter in the Northeast with above-average snow. In addition, our G&A expense for the quarter was above our guidance due to some staffing changes that accelerated compensation expense into the first quarter. In the quarter, we reorganized our Princeton region to report under the New York region. And as a result, we no longer will have a regional manager in Princeton. For the full year, our G&A guidance is unchanged. As we look at the rest of 2014, and as Doug described in his comments, we have pockets of high-value available space in Boston at the Prudential Tower and 100 Federal Street. In San Francisco, we have 3 full floors at Embarcadero Center; and in New York city, we have available floors at 250 West 55th Street and in our Madison Avenue buildings. While marketing of the space is active, most tenants are looking for space for 2015 delivery, so we don't anticipate an economic impact from leasing the availability this year. In Washington, D.C. and in Reston, we're virtually fully leased. In the suburban portfolio, we have good demand in suburban Boston, and we are now 86% leased, up from 78% a year ago. We have one large block of space left at Bay Colony, which is under negotiation for a 2015 occupancy, with the remaining availability in smaller units. In suburban San Francisco, we had good activity in Mountain View, but the majority of our availability is in North San Jose and South San Francisco where the market is slower. Similarly, activity in the suburban DC markets in Maryland and in Springfield, Virginia are slow; and we don't project positive absorption this year. So based on the timing of our lease-up projections, we're really not anticipating meaningful improvement in our occupancy for the rest of 2014. The renewals that Doug discussed in Cambridge, as well as the 100,000-square-foot renewal in the upper half of the GM Building, all with positive mark-to-market, will show up in our straight-line rents and possibly impact our same-store GAAP NOI. Our projection for 2014 same-store GAAP NOI is an increase of 1.75% to 2.5% over 2013. This is an increase of 50 basis points at the low end from our guidance last quarter. Our noncash straight line and fair value lease revenue for 2014 is projected to be $88 million to $98 million. Our 2014 cash NOI projections are unchanged from last quarter, and we project a strong 5% to 6% improvement from 2013. This growth equates to $60 million to $70 million of incremental cash NOI for the company. In our development pipeline, we've made project -- progress in our leasing. Our 4-million-square-foot pipeline now stands at 67% leased. The incremental contribution to NOI from our developments in 2014 is projected to be $28 million to $30 million. Now the 2014 contribution is muted by the timing of our deliveries that come into service later in the year. And in addition, 250 West 55th Street and The Avant are still leasing up. The contribution in 2015 from leased properties will be significantly greater. When stabilized, we expect our pipeline to generate meaningful earnings growth, with a projected first-year stabilized cash return between 6.5% and 7% on $3.2 billion of total investment. We project our hotel to generate modest improvement from our prior guidance and project its contribution to our 2014 NOI to be $13 million to $14 million. The contribution to 2014 FFO from our unconsolidated joint ventures is in line with our prior guidance at $29 million to $34 million. We project development and management fee income for 2014 of $19 million to $22 million, also in line with last quarter's guidance. And as I mentioned, our full year G&A projection is unchanged. We anticipate 2014 expense of $100 million to $104 million. We expect a reduction in our interest expense in the second quarter, reflecting the payoff of our $747 million exchangeable note issuance. However, our interest expense run rate will increase in the third and fourth quarters, as we cease capitalizing interest on 680 Folsom in the second quarter and on 250 West 55th Street in the second and third quarters. Overall, we project net interest expense for the full year to be $446 million to $450 million and includes capitalized interest of $52 million to $56 million. This is modestly better than we projected last quarter. In summary, we're modifying our guidance range for funds from operations to $5.25 to $5.33 per share. This is an increase in our guidance of $0.025 per share at the midpoint and reflects a combination of improvement in projected same-store portfolio NOI and lower interest expense. For the second quarter, we project funds from operations of $1.32 to $1.34 per share. We have not included the impact of any potential acquisitions, dispositions or new development starts in our guidance. As Owen mentioned, we are likely to execute on the sale of multiple assets later this year that would result in a loss of FFO, but the exact timing and magnitude are still uncertain. In addition, we anticipate being in a position to commence the development of a couple of new development projects in Boston that could impact our capitalized interest projections. That completes our formal remarks. I would appreciate it if the operator will now open up the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first call is from Michael Knott of Green Street Advisors. Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : Doug or Owen, just curious if you can talk about, in the context of flat occupancy for the rest of this year, just your thoughts about reaching where you guys normally are in the, say, mid-90s as opposed to where you're at today, over the next couple of years? Owen D. Thomas: You mean the total portfolio? Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : Yes. Owen D. Thomas: I -- honestly, I think that given the churn that we have within our portfolio on some of the larger transactions in Washington, D.C. and the transactions I described in New York City where, for the most part, the majority of the -- these large law firms are going to be giving back space, I would expect that our -- the ability of us to push occupancy in the short term, i.e. 2015, 2016, is going to be challenged. And I think we're probably going to be pretty close to where we are today, which is, what, 93% to 95%. Douglas T. Linde: 92% to 93%. Owen D. Thomas: Yes, 93% to 95%. I think that's where you're going to see sort of us cap out at. We're not -- you're not going to see 96% or 97%. Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : And then, can you also talk about the prospects for the rest of your space at Salesforce Tower and sort of what the timing might be on when we might see the you ink additional deals there? Owen D. Thomas: I will just make the following comment, which is, we have an active group of tenants that are in the market looking for space. As I said, we have one of few blocks of available space that has a -- now has a certain delivery date. We are adjusting and thinking about our approach to the market vis-\u00e0-vis pricing and timing. And we are -- we have proposals outstanding, but there's no other transaction that we would consider imminent. Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then last one for me, it sounds like San Francisco is still on fire with lots of demand. Just -- are you guys at all concerned with the recent thoughts on the NASDAQ and some of the high-flying tech stocks? Owen D. Thomas: I think, and I'll let Bob describe sort of the leasing activity. And as Mike suggested, the majority of the demand right now, Michael, is from what I would refer to as non-high flyers. These are companies that have pretty solid revenue opportunities and actual business on their books. I mean, as an example, LinkedIn being the largest new user in San Francisco, that's a pretty -- what I would refer to as a utility right now for corporate America. And with some of the other larger requirements that are out there, these are not companies that are creating business models with lots of ideas and relatively little revenue. There's lots of revenue and lots of reinvestment. That's -- that is what is driving their need for space and their R&D. And, Bob, I don't know if you have any other thoughts. Robert E. Pester: Yes, I would just add that the activity that we're seeing both at 535 and at Transbay is pretty much evenly split between tech and financial services and law firms. So we're not just dependent on tech to keep this market drive. Operator : Your next call is from Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : I wanted to just come back to a comment, Owen, that you made in your opening remarks about interest rate expectation and how they're shifting or, at least, the prospects for rising rates even a little bit more benign, I think, you said. Is that shifting at all your view of the environment in terms of what you're looking to do, be it on acquisitions versus dispositions? Owen D. Thomas: Well, I think forecasting interest rates is a perilous duty, needless to say. But I do think that the common logic that interest rates are going to rise and the -- as they did last year in the short term, I do think that concern has abated somewhat. I would say, our overall view at Boston Properties is that we will, someday, face rising interest rates. It's just it seems like that's been put on hold, given what's occurred this quarter and given the sluggish economic growth that continues. I wouldn't say that it has shifted our approach. I mean, we -- our capital strategy, as I described, hasn't really shifted. I would say one thing that perhaps has shifted over the last quarter is I think in the private market, for assets in our core markets, has probably gotten more elevated over the last quarter. We're seeing the pricing for trades going up and certainly, the number of investors that are trafficking in the market, we think, is going up as well. So I don't think -- to answer your question in a sentence, I don't think we've changed our approach. Douglas T. Linde: And Jordan, I'd add the following, which is Boston Properties has not traditionally been what I would refer to as a spread investor. We've had a long-term perspective in all of the assets that we purchased. And so we really look at the overall economic characteristics of the rents in the building and how that building is being positioned and what basis we're buying or building that building into. And the fact that lots of folks are looking at the opportunities to invest capital in real estate today because they can finance very cheaply is driving -- that plus the lack of yield anywhere in the world economy, is driving dollars being allocated to our kind of real estate and the kind of things that we would want to buy. So I would say that, sort of to be consistent with Owen, it's becoming more competitive and more difficult for us to underwrite acquisitions today. And so the sort of, I guess, the tit-for-tat on that is that we're probably a little bit more inclined to be sellers than we are buyers, largely due to where interest rates are. And we've seen, as Owen said, the bid for high-quality real estate and particularly, large bulky assets, continue and get stronger, not weaker. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then as a follow-up, in the discussions surrounding the law firms in your portfolio, both -- it sounds like in D.C., as well as maybe Boston? Can you -- or D.C. and New York, I think. Can you maybe just give us a little bit more color in terms of what the potential impact might be, how they're looking to shrink and where we are in this sort of the evolution of what law firms are doing, at least within your portfolio? Douglas T. Linde: So I guess, I'll answer it in 2 different ways. Any law firm that's installation is more than 7 or 8 years old probably has had a different view on how that space should be laid out, as well as how they're organizing their workforces. And so as those leases are expiring, they are looking to become more efficient and change the utilization. And that's creating some incremental additional capacity or organic supply to come onto the marketplace. I also think that there are certain areas of the legal industry that are seeing less in the way of growth opportunities, a.k.a. bankruptcy, right? So there are fewer transactions, and that's leading to some shrinkage in some law firms, just to what their overall business is. So both of those things are going on. I think that we are probably in the fifth or sixth inning of the densification portion of this. And some law firms, in fact, are actually growing on a marginal basis because they are getting bigger from a number of partner perspective, because they're taking partners from other firms or there's still consolidation going on. But net-net, there are more firms that are getting smaller than are sort of maintaining their same size. Raymond A. Ritchey: I'll just add, Doug, this is Ray Ritchey, that we've also been very much a beneficiary of this movement. Arnold & Porter, Government [ph], 601, the activity at 250 West 55th, 500 North Capitol, 2200 Penn, obviously Embarcadero Center with some recent moves there. We've been very much the winner in that dynamic, as well as facing challenges in our existing portfolio. So it's also been a good thing for us. Operator : Your next call is from George Auerbach of ISIS -- ISI Group. George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Doug, Owen, just to touch on your last point about asset pricing, how meaningful is the impact of more foreign or cross-border buyers on IRRs in your market? It just -- it seems like on recent tours of D.C. and the West Coast it's been surprising how much greater the sort of cross-border activity is today versus the past cycles. Just wondering how you think fees and other -- all-cash buyers are influencing IRRs and cap rates? Owen D. Thomas: I think it's meaningful. The buyer interest in assets in our core markets is not exclusively offshore buyers, but I think the flows are certainly increasing from non-U.S. buyers, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, other pools of capital, Asia, Canada, Europe and Middle East. I think it's a major force in the marketplace. George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : If I had to ask you to ballpark it, last 6 months, all-cash return hurdles are down 50 basis points? Owen D. Thomas: I just want to say one thing, which is that, not all of these buyers are all-cash buyers. I think they are prepared to make all-cash bids, but many of them are low-leverage buyers. And whenever we have a conversation with one of the advisers, a.k.a. the Eastons [ph] or the CBREs or the HFS or the JLLs, you name your adviser, they are always quoting the leveraged return that they believe that these various capital pools are expecting to achieve with a low-leverage loan. So while there are certainly some that are prepared to do it on an all-cash basis, most of them, I think, are still looking at using and utilizing the opportunities on the -- in the debt side to enhance their returns. And I think those numbers, on a leverage basis, are somewhere in the low 7s to the low 8s, depending upon the asset mix itself. George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Helpful. Last one for me. I know you build projects when it makes sense to, and not that there's certain investment dollar amounts. But given the pipeline of new opportunities that you laid out in your comments, Doug, how should we think about a reasonable amount of new starts for the company over the next 6 to 12 months? Douglas T. Linde: I think in the next 6 to 12 months, there's probably somewhere in the range of $500 million of new starts. Operator : Your next call is from Michael Bilerman from Citi. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : I just wanted to come towards funding in terms of the pipeline. So you have the $1.4 billion that you now have committed for the current development pipeline, $1.5 billion of potential future development, Doug, which sounds like 500 would start potentially this year. You're obviously in an unbelievable capital position with $1.2 billion of cash, potentially $1 billion of sales under leveraged. You can go tap construction loans if you wanted to. I'm just trying to get a sense of does common equity ever enter the equation at all in your mind? I know LaBelle said that there's no debt or equity this year. But I'm just trying to get a picture of what the future may hold in terms of funding what will be $2.5 billion of future development? Douglas T. Linde: I'll answer the question in the following way. Our current pipeline in our current business plan in terms of the asset activities that we have on the table don't contemplate the need for raising any additional equity. That does not mean that something different might not occur over the next 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, that would be a transaction that would be transformative in some way, shape or form that would not necessarily require that we do have some sort of an equity component to it. So the current business on the books does not necessitate any additional common equity. Michael E. LaBelle: The other thing I would point out is that I mentioned we have a $3.2 billion development pipeline, with $1.4 billion left to fund. So we have $1.8 billion that's out the door and not generating any cash right now. And that's going to de-lever us pretty significantly. You mentioned our low leverage already, but it will continue to go down as these, as 250 and The Avant and 680 Folsom start generating cash flow in the next 6 to 18 months, which provides us with capacity to use debt if we need debt to fund the additional pipeline. Douglas T. Linde: I guess the only other thing I would say is because there's some deals that we're looking at right now. There are some potential sellers that would do things on a \"OP [ph] basis\" that might suggest that we have a de minimis amount of equity that's associated with any one transaction, but that's really part of the structuring mechanism that we would use to be successful at the acquisition. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Well, I think, you -- Doug, you talked about it's more difficult than to write acquisitions, and so I'm just curious in terms of that pipeline, sounds like on a wholly-owned basis, but whether you would find that a capital partner would want the sponsorship and the operating expertise for you to come in, in a joint venture where maybe they're a 45% owner or greater but would want BXP to join them in a large scale acquisition of a portfolio. Is that something that we should think about that you would be interested in doing? Douglas T. Linde: Look, we are open-minded about acquisitions that our core market's in, and obviously, other places that would have this -- a similar profile from our -- from an operating platform perspective. I think there are relatively few large portfolios like that. I mean, there's a lot of talk right now about the portfolio in Boston that is being considered to be sold, which is at somewhere, I guess, in the neighborhood of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion portfolio. And it's not something that we spend much time on because we like our position in Boston, we like our pricing in Boston, and it's not a portfolio that we necessarily think will be additive to our business plan. So it would have to be something that would be very unique. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : And then just last question. You talked about sort of the occupancy trends. Can you talk a little bit about mark-to-market on the rollovers. If you sort of look at the remaining '14, '15 and '16 rollovers, both from a price per foot that's expiring, but the mix is very different, so if you look at your '15 roll, 30% is in New York and San Francisco, and you look at the '16, and all of a sudden that jumps to 60%. I'm just curious, as we think about what's expiring over the next almost 3 years, how should we think about the potential upside in those rents? Douglas T. Linde: So as I recall, and I don't have all the figures right in front of me. But that in 2014 and 2015, the majority of our roll is below market across the portfolio. As we get into these transactions that we are sort of going into, that could be, what I would refer to as early renewal and potential take backs, some of those transactions are closer to market. And in certain cases, in New York City in particular, they're slightly above market. So I think that the 2017-ish area is a little bit more muted. And although we have a lot of San Francisco exposure in '16 and '17, and all of that exposure is somewhere between, as I said before, 15% and 25% below market, so it really enhances that. And we just went through our Cambridge portfolio. I mean, the markup was 50%. We did not anticipate a 50% markup on a net basis. I mean, we were sort of anticipating a markup that was 20% to 25%. The market's just exploded. And so if we have continued -- continue to see those types of changes, I think we'll be in a terrific position. Operator : Your next call comes from John Guinee of Stifel. John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : I'm just going to -- get your pencils out, I'll give you a bunch of real quick questions. First, Patriot Ridge and Zanker Road were 2 examples of when the primary kind of moved out, gutting it -- the buildings down to the steel, I think, and starting again, do you have any more of those functionally-challenged assets in the portfolio? That's question one. Question two, what you've implied here with the asset sales and redevelopment -- dollars redeployed into development is either a special dividend or a dividend increase, assuming the tax basis is fairly low. Can you discuss that? And then three, can you briefly discuss just the capital staff [ph] on the Transbay? Are you putting up 100% of the dollars for effectively 100% of economics, or is it 95%-95%, or how does that all lay out? Douglas T. Linde: Let me see, I'll start with the third one first. So we are a 95%-5% partner and we're responsible for 95% of the capital and Heinz is responsible for 5% of the capital. Right now, our view is that we're going to fund it with internal proceeds from our cash flow and our existing capital. And so there's no sort of change in that. It's fair to say that it's a building that we could put a construction loan on, but it's really -- it's not something we're thinking about at the moment. With regards to the second question -- the first question which is regards to sort of assets that are \"repositionable.\" I think the one area that we are looking at where there might be some additional stuff like that is, interestingly, our single-story stuff in VA 95. That's a park that has primarily been leased to the GSA and contractors of the GSA for, I don't know, Ray, 25 years? Raymond A. Ritchey: At least. Douglas T. Linde: And so as those buildings rollover and the GSA consolidates and densifies, some of those buildings probably have a repositioning opportunity and may need it in terms of being \"acceptable to the market,\" because they -- nothing's been done to those buildings for quite some time. But interestingly, John, we've actually quietly gotten rid of a lot of our other similar buildings to the stuff at -- it's Patriots Park, not Patriots Ridge, and Zanker Road over the last few years in the Boston portfolio, as well as in Maryland. And so there are -- those opportunities are few and far between. And then the dividend question is -- I want to -- unfortunately, I'm going to have to take a pass on, because the actual size of the sale, the various tax bases of the assets, are so different for the various things that we're looking that it's too hard to give an honest answer to whether or not we would have a special dividend or we would have an increase in our current dividend. I mean, I am assuming that most of the assets that we are considering selling have a relatively low basis. So the pattern that we went through in 2013, which was at the end of the year, to see if there were opportunities to deploy that capital into new acquisitions and new developments, would be the first alternative. And to the extent that we can't do that, we would have a dividend opportunity that we would announce towards the end of the calendar year. Operator : Your next call comes from word from Vance Edelson from Morgan Stanley. Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : On the pricing per square foot for Salesforce as a tenant in the new tower, how do you think the price point you mentioned in the 50s compares to what you would've achieved if you went through the longer and, potentially, more arduous process of leasing floor by floor? Presumably, there's some sort of volume discount. So can talk about what you were willing to offer in order to secure such a great tenant? Douglas T. Linde: So we think that low-50s on a triple-net basis was a good market deal. The -- interestingly, the way the discussions went, the tenant grew over time, and as the tenant grew, they got higher in the building and we felt that as you moved up the building, it was worth more or had a higher price associated with it. I honestly don't believe that we would have achieved a, necessarily, a premium if we sort of did it on a floor-by-floor basis. But one thing that we did do as part of the transaction, and you can think about how you might value this in lots of different ways and I'm not try and put a number on it, is that we did offer Salesforce the ability to name the building the Salesforce Tower. And that we viewed as a very important element for them, and one that we think was baked into the overall economics of the transaction. So I would say that there may not have been a discount per se associated with the rents that we were achieving on the lower 714,000 square feet of space, but that other attribute of the transaction was important to them. And it was something we were prepared to sort of throw into the pot. Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And then related to that, have you noticed any uptick in the interest level amongst other prospective tenants since you announced the good news with Salesforce and since you named the tower? Is their very presence a key selling point? Does it create any sort of buzz for the remaining space? Or would you say that any uptick in interest is more related to the simple fact that you're going forward with the project now? Douglas T. Linde: Bob, you want to take that one? Robert E. Pester: Yes, I would say that from a standpoint of perception in the market, that the fact that we're going forward is a big plus. And it clearly has generated the interest from tenants that were not looking at the building previously. Operator : Your next call comes from Jeff Spector from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : This is actually Jamie Feldman. You guys are in a unique perspective that you can see what the different tech demand looks like across San Francisco, Boston and New York. So I guess my first question is just can you talk a little bit about what they're doing in their space and how it differs by market? And along the same lines, as you look forward, where do you think you'll see the best growth across those 3 markets? Douglas T. Linde: Okay. I'm trying to think about the best way to answer that question for you, Jamie. So why don\u2019t I do the following. Why don't I ask John Powers to talk about what's going on in New York City, and then Brian, you can give a quick summary of what you see in, particularly on the biotech and life sciences side in Cambridge. And then Bob, you can talk about San Francisco. John Francis Powers : This is John Powers. Tech here has certainly grown in the last 4 or 5 years particularly. But defining tech in New York is, I think, a little different than in San Francisco because we have a lot of mature tech companies here, too. Overall, they are not a big player in the market, the whole tech sector, but the growth has been very outsized. And it's been primarily in the Midtown South area. So we have some conventional technology companies that utilize traditional space, but we also have the WeWorks and the other high-tech companies that are predominantly in the Midtown South. Bryan J. Koop: Yes, this is Bryan speaking for Boston market. I think what we're seeing, which is really interesting, is we're seeing a little bit of a bifurcation of our tech tenants looking for different types of talent. And Doug mentioned earlier the growth that we've seen recently in Waltham, and I think that's really indicative. They're looking for an engineer or programmer that could be a little bit more mature, call it, in the family formation part of their life, and they are looking for those school districts. And that's been a big benefit for the Waltham market, what you've seen this big decrease in vacancy over the last quarter. And it's been really relatively quiet because there's been so much news about, call it, the drive for urban. We continue to see our urban tech tenants in Cambridge, their talent that they're searching for is younger, more millennium. And we see it in terms of the types of the space they're looking for as well. Doug mentioned biotech, it's a sector that we are continuing to see strong, strong growth, from great customers, for example, like Biogen. And yesterday, we were just at an event where we're opening up the Broad Institute building that we did with them, and I think it's indicative of what's to come. Robert E. Pester: In San Francisco, I think, there's been a fundamental shift in the last 5 years as far as tech where they used to be in the valley and maybe had a satellite office in San Francisco, to now where you're seeing them do a wholesale move, and have a satellite office down in the valley with their headquarters in San Francisco. I think you also have to differentiate between what we refer to as mature tech tenants versus some of these start-ups. I would use the example of both Macys.com and Riverbed that wanted to be in a real office building, with real amenities, and has the power and HVAC capacity to have a density of 7 or 8 people per thousand square feet, which in fact, we have with both of those tenants in our building, versus the brick and timber building. And I think both Trulia and Salesforce validate that these Class A newer office buildings will attract tech as well as [indiscernible] type tenants. Douglas T. Linde: So just to sort of conclude the comments, Jamie, I would say that if you were to sort of have to put it all together in terms of the way they're using their space and the way that the space is being built out or what's attractive to them. I think the individual buildings share a few common components which are : they are adaptable to open space usage with a limited number of impediments, i.e. columns; they have really great light and air. So they either have high-volume ceilings or they have high, large window exposures that will bring light into the space, because if you don't have -- if you have lots of people in there and you've got a very deep floor, you want to make sure you have lots of light and air. And then they're, for the most part, being amenitized with lots of food and eateries and other sort of smaller conveniences for those tenants on any individual floor. But that in itself is not necessarily the most critical component. In some of these markets, there's a question of where it's physically located, where the cool sort of happening place might be, which is why we see what's going on in Midtown South occurring. And a lot of those buildings are not buildings that are ideally suited to high-density, great space. I mean, these are all -- I mean these buildings are older, pre-war buildings that are -- they happen to be near Gramercy Park and near Union Square, and they happen to be on the L-line where all the people are living. And so it's a clear indication of the physical location is equally as important as the overall space. And honestly, I think that if you say which one was the priority, it's where it is and then what it is. James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay, that's very helpful. I guess what I'm trying to get a little bit more at is just the functionality in the different markets. So if Google's leasing space in all 3, kind of what are they doing in the different 3 markets. And then how does that help you think about where they may grow the most going forward? Or is it safe to assume just if the companies are in San Francisco and they're going to grow, they're going to grow most in San Francisco? Douglas T. Linde: I think it's a question of the maturity of the company and how they got to where they are. So Google in Cambridge, as an example, they acquired ITA. And ITA was a critical component to their travel business, and so it's also been a magnet for other types of acquisitions in the Boston area, similarly, to what Google did in New York City. I mean, it's both an engineering hub, as well as a sales hub. And I think a lot of these younger companies, over time, will potentially run out of resources, i.e. the critical component which is the human horsepower to run these businesses, and they're going to look for places in the world where other people of a similar -- with similar characteristics are currently working, and those happen to be places like Cambridge and like Boston and New York City and San Francisco. I mean, I've said this before; one of the things we watch on a quarterly basis is where the new capital is being invested on the VC side. And if you look over a long period of time, the 2 powerhouses have been the Silicon Valley and San Francisco, way above everyone else; and Boston Cambridge second. And over the past 5 to 6 years, New York City has become the third critical hub of that venture capital investing, particularly in the technology and the biotech life sciences world. And those 3 areas are where there is clearly a knowledge base of workers that are the horsepower behind these businesses' growth. Bryan J. Koop: One further comment, Doug, is just -- your comment on place. Once the place is determined, you take an example like Biogen. There is a, we think, an increased conscious regard for the design of the space. And Biogen is a good example of a recent building we did with them. There's just a higher thoughtfulness in how the space is designed, how the associates are working together for just greater productivity and innovation. We continue to see that grow with -- more across the tech sector and in the biotech, surely. James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And then I guess, just finally on the same topic. If you think about what happened in San Francisco, which is, first, they wanted the brick and timber, and now, they're more in the modern, urban-campus type buildings. If you look at New York where Midtown South is obviously pretty full at this point, what feels the most to you -- which submarket feels the most to you, like where they may want to expand next, how they're looking at your Transbay and the urban campuses? Douglas T. Linde: John, you want to take that one? John Francis Powers : Sure. Clearly, the Midtown South market has been the hottest market. And as Doug said, the product there is not exactly the, for the most part, the product that they want. So we have seen the few buildings in Brooklyn have a lot of activity and we think that will be leased up over the course of the year. Pricing in Downtown has also moved up significantly in the first quarter, and a lot of repricing in Downtown as tech companies -- or TAMI companies that are getting priced out of Midtown South as the tech companies take the space, are also moving to Downtown. And we've also seen some moves towards Midtown. So I think that the tech driver in the Midtown South is forcing a lot of decisions as the prices have gone up in that market. James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : All right. That's all helpful. But just one more follow-up. You had mentioned Citi giving up space at 601 Lex. Did they say anything about 399 Park, or is that still up in the air? John Francis Powers : No. Our expectation is that they will leave 399 Park. They did their deal Downtown on Greenwich Street. They are in a planning mode this year to sort out where all the people go when it's all done. They'll probably be in construction for 2 or 3 years there to move everyone. And our expectation is that they will leave 399, but not the branch. Operator : Your next call comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill. Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : Owen, if I heard correctly in your opening comments, I think you said you're looking at a potential of $250 million of potential deals. Just want to get a sense, is that a gross number or is that just BXP's equity? Or are most of those development sites so that that's really land we're talking about, so it could be something more than that? Owen D. Thomas: No, my comment on the $250 million was on acquisitions. So what we've been saying -- what I've been saying over the last few quarters is the acquisition market's been very competitive and we're finding it more challenging, although we're trying. And my point was is that over the last quarter or year-to-date, we've made proposals on various acquisitions that -- on a gross basis of $250 million. And those situations, several of them are not resolved at this time. Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : But are those development sites or those are [indiscernible]. Owen D. Thomas: These are the acquisitions of existing buildings. The development sites, dealt with separately with all the figures that I went through. Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : Okay. Okay. And then for Ray. Just a bit more color on 501 K. Are you getting more enthusiastic about putting more dollars to work in D.C.? Or is this just a neighborhood play where you see there's likely to be a shift towards this neighborhood and therefore, this is a good opportunity? Raymond A. Ritchey: Well, obviously as you know, this is the site directly across the street from 601 Mass where we're building Arnold & Porter, is now a block away from where it looks like Venable's going to move their headquarters. It's clearly -- it's 2 blocks away from Heinz's city center. And as Doug talked about, we have a full city block. We talked about a building that's 520,000 square feet; the density is actually closer to 560,000 or 570,000. And we're adapting the strategy there where less is more, and we're designing the building that, we think, is unique in the market, that not only could address the space needs of our traditional tenants, law firms, associations, but also can be exceedingly attractive to the tech tenants we've been addressing all morning. So we're very excited about it. We're excited about having a great partner like the Stuart [ph] family, full city block across the street from where we've already proven tremendous success in the development community and we're -- we couldn't be more excited about. Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : Okay. Okay. And does this -- does your activity here -- may heat up the competition more for the FBI site as people think there's more potential? Or they -- or people view a developed -- or people are still skeptical or cautious on development in D.C.? Raymond A. Ritchey: Well, the FBI site is a completely different discussion. It's progressing. They're trying to pick the new site for the new location and then have a competition for the J. Edgar Hoover building on the avenue. That is many years away. 501 K is a much more immediate type of development opportunity. Operator : Your next call comes from Sheila McGrath from Evercore. Sheila McGrath - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Yes. I was just wondering if you look at 55th Street leasing and also Salesforce Tower, how the rent has moved in San Francisco, if your return on cost expectation has improved, let's say, versus a year ago? Douglas T. Linde: So I think that we've been pretty consistent that the return on cost on a traditional basis at 250 West 55th Street has been suboptimal, in our opinion, based upon when we conceived the project, because of the start and stop on it. But net-net, it's going to be somewhere just north of 6% on a NOI basis, sort of a non-GAAP perspective. And I think that our current lease-up is consistent with that type of a range. The Salesforce Tower building, I think, we have become more bullish on our expectations for what our overall return will be because we've been able to achieve a more significant premium to the rents that we entered when we originally conceived the project. I think when we started out a year ago, people said, \"Dude, where do you think you're going to be on this asset?\" And we said, \"I think it's going to be $800 a square foot. It's going to be somewhere between 6% and 7%.\" And today, what we're saying is it's going to be $800 a square foot and then we think it's going to be in excess of 7%. Sheila McGrath - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Okay. And one other quick question. You mentioned in your prepared remarks a new direction perhaps for Princeton and maybe Mountain View. Could you just be a little bit more specific? Douglas T. Linde: Yes, Owen said 2 things. He said that we're doing a -- we're recapitalizing Princeton, which is really a question of, right now, the property is 100% owned by Boston Properties and there's no debt on it. And so we're saying to the market, \"Is anybody interested in being our partner? And if you're interested in being our partner, would we be interested in putting some debt on it if that was the right execution?\" So that's the process we're going through. And then in Mountain View, Owen said that we have an unsolicited offer on a portion of our single-story assets, and we're exploring that alternative. Operator : Your next call comes from Ross Nussbaum from UBS. Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : A couple of quick ones. First, when you guys recast the Apple lease, are all those over overage rents going to get put in as fixed-base going forward? Douglas T. Linde: So let me -- I'm going to give you an uninspired and probably non -- not very committal answer, which is we don't really talk about how we structure any individual lease. We have an interesting relationship with Apple right now where there's a percentage-rent and there's a fixed-rent component. And there will continue to be a fixed-rent component, as well as a percentage-rent component. And it's just -- it's not appropriate to sort of talk about how that's going to work. Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. That's a segue into the broader topic of New York street retail. Your brethren in the REIT sector and the office space are pretty hot and heavy on New York street retail. You got a couple of retail REITs doing it. Is that something that you guys have thought about spending more time on? It's clearly been the hottest part of the New York market the last couple of years. Owen D. Thomas: Well, we -- I would say, on a stand-alone basis, we haven't spent a lot of time on it. The -- clearly, we own some terrific street level retail as part of our portfolio. And we continue to look at new opportunities in New York, primarily on the development side; a little bit less on the acquisition side. And some of them have retail associated with them. But in terms of a standalone strategy to pursue Street level retail, we're not doing that right now in New York. Douglas T. Linde: So the only thing I would add, Ross, is that we have 2 large retail opportunities in front of us -- actually, 3. We clearly, if and when FAO Schwartz decides to leave the General Motors Building, there's going to be a major -- a block of space that can be accessed from Fifth Avenue, it can be accessed from 50th Street -- 59th Street, it can be accessed from Madison Avenue. And how we utilize that space, which is currently on 3 stories, will be an interesting opportunity for us to redevelop. The second and third are over on Lexington Avenue. We obviously have the space on the ground floor of 399. John Powers suggested that Citibank would like to keep the branch. How much of that branch they're going to keep and then how you get into that branch and how you might access other space on either Lexington Avenue or on either of the streets is going to be a question. And then the third opportunity is, once upon a time, the retail at 601 Lexington Avenue was sort of the new cool thing in New York City. I mean, I remember going to Conran's way back when in the early '80s. And quite frankly, we think that there's an opportunity to really revitalize the retail at the atrium at Citigroup Center. And so those are sort of the 3 major opportunities that we're going to be looking at, investing capital and opportunity, to really enhance the overall cash flow from -- over the next couple of years. Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. On the disposition front, can you spend just a minute talking about why a recap of Carnegie Center as opposed to an outright sale, which I know you guys tried to do a little while back. And then on The Avenue in D.C., is this the optimal time to be selling given that the NOI growth [indiscernible] south on that asset? Owen D. Thomas: Well, let me start with Carnegie Center. I think we debated. We feel that we've had some terrific leasing activity at the property and it is approaching a more stabilized level. I think the occupancy right now at Carnegie Center is in the low 90s. But we still see some upside in the asset. We have development opportunities. We're doing a build to suit right now for NRG, as you know. So we thought, perhaps an ideal result would be to do a leveraged recap, possibly with a partner. We're very pleased with our management there and with the success that we've had with the property. And we found last year, in our Times Square Tower exercise, that we ended up doing that as a joint venture given where we found a lot of strength in the capital market for our assets. So on The Avenue, I think -- as I mentioned in my remarks, I think we don't know the answer to your question yet. Clearly, the execution that we're currently working on we think is attractive and it fits into the categories of the assets that we're selling. But the outcome of that sale is undetermined right now. Operator : Your next call comes from Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Just wanted to just touch base -- or go back to the comments on the VC centers, Silicon Valley, Cambridge and more recently, New York. Just wondering if you think there's room for or a need for a fourth center, maybe in D.C., where Vornado is helping seed some tech funds and that kind of thing? Douglas T. Linde: I would -- I think that we would all be enthusiastic if the brainpower that is concentrated in northern Virginia and the technology-oriented organizations that are in the defense home and security, cyber security, whatever you want to call it, would consider locating portions of their workforce in the district. I think the district would think that will be a wonderful thing, too. I think the interesting thing about D.C. is the commuting patterns and where people are living, and there's got to be a little bit of a change in the concentration of talent into areas that are not \"traditional.\" I don't really want to comment on what Vornado is doing in Crystal City because I -- it's just not where we have any investment. But we clearly would be exceedingly enthusiastic, and Ray has been working with the administration about ways to incentivize some of these companies to be more open to looking in the city through economic incentives that would encourage them to put roots down in the city. Raymond A. Ritchey: That's kind of the motivation behind our 501 K acquisition, the site, to have a platform where meaningful tech relocations could take place in a location that is consistent with where they try to put their workforce. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Got it. And would you be sort of interested in potentially doing some sort of side investments? Simon's also announced some stuff on that front in terms of retail innovation. Just curious if you'd have any interest in helping potentially spur that demand through some investments. Douglas T. Linde: It's an idea that was in vogue in 2000 and 1999, and we decided that seeking warrants was not a core competency of ours. So I think that it would -- we would struggle to put together a portfolio of -- in the D.C. investments in order to entice tenants to come into a particular part of our D.C. market. I guess anything is possible, but I would not anticipate that it would be a core strategy that we would follow. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. And then just going back to Transbay, I know we spent a lot of time on it. But in the prepared remarks, you talked about some blocks of space expiring in the market overall, in the 2017, '19 time frame. Can you just maybe comment on some of the tenants that might be looking for some larger space in that time frame? Douglas T. Linde: So I announced -- named the number that are currently in the market today. But between 2017 and -- or 2016 and 2018, I think there is about 6.5 million square feet of lease expirations in high-quality financial district buildings. The majority of them being law firms and traditional [indiscernible] type of organizations. And so, traditionally, those tenants, as their lease expires, look at the marketplace and look at ways to become more efficient, look at the way they're utilizing their space. And more times than not, they choose to sort of change their current location. And that's the sort of market that we, I think, are looking at for some of the smaller blocks of space in Transbay Tower meaning 150,000 square feet and down. Some of the larger requirements that are out there are really, we think, going to be more tech-oriented because those organizations are looking for larger blocks of space and they have growth that can't be met in existing assets. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. And just one last sort of question on the law firm discussion. In terms of densities at 250 West where you signed up a few law firm deals, can you talk about the density there versus sort of the 7- and 8-year-old leases that you have in the portfolio? Douglas T. Linde: Sure. John, you want to take that one? John Francis Powers : Sure. Certainly, there's a move towards increased density, and that comes from a couple of reasons. Law libraries are much smaller or nonexistent now. The ratio of support people to attorneys has changed. So it's -- part of it's density, but part of it's just sizing the space to the new characteristics of the law firm. The 2 examples that we have, MoFo and Kaye Scholer, certainly, have increased their density significantly, but certainly not what we see in other places. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : I guess, can you talk about what that is in terms of square foot per worker? John Francis Powers : I don't have the specific numbers for MoFo. Operator : Your next call comes from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Just quick question on the suburban portfolio. Very meaningful lease-up both in Boston and also Princeton this quarter. Just wanted to get a general sense if that was a quarter-specific, or there's some opportunities you were looking at that just happened to land or whether those markets truly are feeling much better from a demand and also a rental pricing perspective? Douglas T. Linde: So I think I said in my remarks, Tayo, that the suburban Waltham market is very strong right now. It's probably as close to where it was in sort of the early -- late 2000, 2001 time frame, than it's ever -- than it's been since then. I mean it's -- there is literally not a block of 150,000 square feet of quality space between -- in Lexington or Waltham right now, which means that build to suits are sort of part of the dialogue. And we've seen rents go, in the last 1.5 years, from mid 20s to the low 40s for the best space in the marketplace in those buildings like Bay Colony and Waltham Woods and CityPoint and Wellesley Office Park and Riverside, which are sort of the -- those are the higher quality buildings. And none of those buildings have a block of space that's in excess of probably 40,000 or 50,000 square feet. So that market has just been a consistent stronger market with better demand, and it's really been life sciences companies, some of them coming out of Cambridge and some of them being located in the Waltham-Lexington market and just expanding. Cubist Pharmaceuticals being the most significant of those. In Princeton, the -- I don't think Northern New Jersey, in total, has really had a strong recovery. But we have been the fortunate beneficiary, and we've worked hard at it, to attracting some pharmaceutical companies, particularly foreign pharmaceutical companies, that have gone through some explosive growth, and we did some things to entice them to come to Carnegie Center that have worked out. And so a company like Otsuka Pharmaceuticals, we started out and we gave them 23,000 square feet of, basically, free space for 6 months. And now, they've leased 140,000 square feet and they're talking about leasing another 80,000 square feet of space. So good things happen when you establish a relationship with a great customer and you treat them right. And so we have just been the beneficiary of some really strong organic growth within the Princeton portfolio. And as those companies do well, they become more attractive places for companies that are like them. And so we've seen a significant amount of other foreign pharmaceutical interest in the Princeton, and particularly in the Carnegie Center portfolio, and we don't think that, that is a sort of a quarterly phenomena. We think it's a consistent trend. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Great. That's helpful. And then just one more for me. The negative cash mark-to-market on the Boston portfolio in the quarter, I just was hoping I could get some details around that? Douglas T. Linde: Yes. I think, I said -- maybe you missed it. So we had a lease that was signed in 2010 for 75,000 square feet at 111 Huntington Avenue. If you're curious, the rent went from $78 at the time, to $62.50, but there was a limited amount of tenant improvements and there was no free rent, so no down time. And so it was -- and net effect of it is actually a higher overall rent. But that lease actually landed this quarter so the new rent commenced. And if you pull that out, it goes from a negative 13% to a positive 4%. Operator : Your next call comes from Brad Burke from Goldman Sachs. Bradley K. Burke - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Just one. Looking at the $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion portfolio on Boston that's been discussed as being for sale, and you look at those properties, and you see the pricing that's been discussed and you make adjustments for quality occupancy sub-markets etc. How do you think about that as a comp for your current Boston portfolio? Is it better than what you would've thought, or is it in line with what you would've thought? And if this transaction were to occur, does that make you any more optimistic about some of the potential development projects that you're thinking about in Boston? Douglas T. Linde: Okay. That's a loaded question. So let me try and answer it without putting my foot [ph] in my mouth. The portfolio that is being sold is a combination of some, what we refer to as the jewels of the portfolio, as well as some more commodity-like real estate. In total, the valuation that they believe they are going to achieve and they very well may achieve it, would, I think, look -- make our portfolio in Boston look like it was being priced -- it's currently being valued at $0.60 to $0.70 on the dollar relative to what those buildings are going to go for. If in fact the buildings do sell for what they are reported to be listed for, then I would hope that the expectations that those landlords have for where they think rents are, are going to go up. And so that will be an indication that there's going to be more incremental pricing pressure in the overall Boston CBD market, as well as Cambridge -- one of the buildings is in Cambridge, which would clearly push rents and, therefore, make development more attractive because you have higher rents and you know what your costs are. And if your return on cost gets to a certain point, you're going to start a development. So I think that's all sort of a positive opportunity for the development activity in our portfolio in Boston which, again, currently is 888 Boylston Street sooner rather than later, and then a 600,000 square foot building plus a low-rise building at North Station. And the other piece which we've alluded to, but really isn't on anyone's radar screen, is that we're working with the city to put some additional towers on top of the, what's referred to as the 100 Clarendon Street garage, which is the site that is adjacent to the John Hancock Tower. But that's off into the future, so you shouldn't be putting that on your paper from a modeling perspective. And then North Station's probably the one that's closest, after 888 Boylston Street, from a timing perspective. Operator : At this time, I would like to turn the call back to management for any additional remarks. Owen D. Thomas: Mort? Is there any final marks -- remarks you'd like to make? Okay, I guess not. Anyway, thank you, everyone, for your time and attention. Operator : This concludes today's Boston Properties Conference Call. Thank you, again, for attending, and have a great day.",

During the question-and-answer portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, our Executive Vice President of Acquisitions and Development, and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Mort for his formal remarks. Mortimer B. Zuckerman: Good morning, everybody. We are, as everybody else is in this wonderful economy of ours, basically operating in a fairly weak economy and a fairly low rate of growth and, particularly, in a fairly weak increase in employment where a large part of the employment comes from part-time work rather than from full-time work. Having said that, though, the markets that we are in, as you've all known, and we've sort of underscored over and over again, frankly are, if I could put it in popular terms, the top 1% of the markets in New York, Boston, Washington and San Francisco. They're the best markets, we believe, of any major cities in the United States. And it shows up in the activities that we are enjoying and working with. In particular, in each one of these markets, we have a range of products and those products, frankly, are meeting with a pretty good response from the marketplace to the extent that there is demand, and in each of these markets, there is demand. It's not a overwhelming demand, but it's a solid demand. The strongest markets are, for example, in San Francisco where they have the location there of the online world. It's probably the headquarters or the leading city for the online world, and they're growing at rates that we have not seen ever in any particular market. But Washington, New York and, indeed, Boston are still -- and Cambridge are still additional markets. In Washington, we, of course, also have a very, very substantial activity in Reston, Virginia. So we have a diversification even within these markets. Nevertheless, the one advantage that we are, frankly, able to exploit, take advantage of, is the interest rate environment which, as you all know, is almost at record lows over an extended period of time. It's certainly been the longest period of low interest rates that we've had since the end of World War II, and this gives us the chance to finance our activities and finance the company and to be able to refinance our activities when necessary. So in that sense, the environment for the company is actually pretty good in these markets, pretty good in the financial markets and in the markets that we are in, in the buildings that we are doing, where we are sort of in the upper end of the office market. There are still a lot of activity in there, so we're all feeling pretty good about it. We're kind of a little wary of the progress we've made over the past quarter, the past year. And with the progress that we foresee for the next period of time, as I say, particularly in San Francisco, which will be covered here, it's just been an opportunity for us to do what we do and have done, which is to find good sites, to build good buildings, to lease them well, to manage them well and to hold onto a good number of our clients on a longer-term basis. And to have built up credibility in the marketplace, that does make it easier for us to do all of what I've just described, both in terms of acquisition of sites, of building the buildings, when we're getting the tenants or financing the building.  So we're in a fairly comfortable place here, I don't want to overstate it, but I also don't want to understate it. With that, if I may, I'll just end my comments and turn it over to Owen. Owen D. Thomas: Thank you, Mort. Good morning, everyone. As usual, I'll touch briefly on the operating environment, and our overall performance for the second quarter and then provide an update on our capital strategy and execution. Mort covered some details on the environment. I would just reiterate that we believe the U.S. economy continues to experience somewhat sluggish growth characteristics and the economic indicators are mixed. As all of you know, GDP growth in the first quarter was revised down to negative 2.9%. Although the second quarter GDP numbers have came out this morning at 4%, which was certainly above consensus forecast, full year GDP growth is estimated to be 3%, and I think that will probably now be raised as well. And the payroll numbers in June, at least on their face, were more favorable, and published unemployment's dropping -- has dropped to about 6.1%. Importantly, the impact of this sluggish and uneven growth on our business has not changed substantially from what we reported to you over the last few quarters. Those markets, such as San Francisco, Cambridge and segments of New York City, which are driven by tenants and technology and other creative sectors, are experiencing very favorable growth characteristics in terms of rent increases and net absorption. However, likewise, those markets that are more reliant on traditional tenants, such as government, financials and law firms, are exhibiting lower levels of activity and growth. For us, those markets would be downtown Washington, D.C. and, to some extent Midtown Manhattan. Now moving to results for the second quarter for us. We performed well and made considerable progress in the execution of our business. FFO for the second quarter was $1.35 per share, which is $0.02 per share above consensus forecast. There are several recurring and nonrecurring items in the quarterly result, which Mike will cover in his remarks later in the call. Also in the quarter, we completed 88 leases, representing 2.1 million square feet, with the San Francisco and Boston regions being the largest contributors to that result. The 714,000 square foot lease with Salesforce.com is obviously also a large contributor to our leasing results. Our in-service properties in the aggregate are 93% leased, up 60 basis points from 92.4% leased at the end of the first quarter. And lastly, we also made significant progress executing our development pipeline and our asset monetization plan, which leads to my next topic, which is turning to capital strategy. As Mort referenced, interest rates continue to decline over the last quarter. The 10-year U.S. Treasury has dropped roughly 0.5% or 50 basis points to below 2.5% since year-end. But despite the continued commitment by the Federal Reserve to taper its quantitative leasing program, investor enthusiasm for real estate, particularly in our core markets, remains high. Our capital strategy remains consistent with what we've been communicating to you over the last several quarters. And that is, given pricing levels for assets in our core markets, we continue to find acquisitions challenging. However, we do continue to evaluate new investment opportunities in all our markets for both existing buildings and new development. Currently, we have the acquisition of a single building under a Letter of Intent in Washington, D.C., for under $100 million and are evaluating several additional properties and development sites where we believe Boston Properties has the unique ability to add value and, therefore, compete. Given low interest rates and attractive pricing for our existing assets, we continue to actively monetize selected assets in our portfolio. We've made significant progress in our disposition activities in the second quarter, having closed 1 deal and placed 4 additional sales under contract, representing $437 million in gross sales proceeds. Yesterday, we closed the disposition of a portion of our Mountain View single-story product. We received an unsolicited offer and are selling a group of buildings comprising 198,000 square feet for $92 million. Sale price represents the 5.6% cap rate and $464 per square foot, and we purchased the properties for $290 a square foot. The buildings were initially purchased in 2008, pre-crash, and the sale generated a 23% unleveraged total return to shareholders. The portfolio is being sold to a user, who is evaluating the acquisition development plan. Next, we also have under contract for sale, Patriots Park, which is a 705,000 square foot suburban office complex located in Reston, Virginia. The sale price of $321 million represents a 5.2% cap rate and $455 a square foot, which we think is particularly attractive given the buildings are in a suburban location, outside of Reston's urban core and are leased to the GSA for 20 years with flat rent. This asset was purchased 16 years ago in 1998 and the sale generated 11.5% unleveraged total return to shareholders. We also have under contract 2 land parcels, settling $24 million in gross sales proceeds. As you know, we also attempted to sell The Avenue, a 335-unit Class A apartment building we built near Washington Circle and downtown Washington, D.C. We have been under contract and engaged with a single buyer for several months. At the present time, the buyer is unable to perform, which has lead us to take the property off the market. And then, lastly, with respect to asset monetization, we continue to target at least $1 billion in sales this year and are evaluating the possibility of additional asset joint ventures similar to the transaction we completed with Times Square Tower last year. Lastly, on capital strategy, we will continue to emphasize development for our new investment activities, given the opportunity we see to recycle capital from the sale of our older buildings into new projects with higher returns. We made significant progress in the second quarter advancing the execution of our development. Our active development pipeline now consist of 12 projects representing 4.8 million square feet with a total projected cost of $3.6 billion, up from $2.5 billion at year-end. We have added to the active pipeline this year the vertical portion of the Salesforce Tower in San Francisco, 888 Boylston Street in Boston's Back Bay, 10 CityPoint and a related retail building in Waltham, Mass. and several other smaller developments. We continue to be in the pre-development stage on another set of projects with strong potential in all our markets. In the aggregate, our share of these projects represents an additional future pipeline of over $1.2 billion in gross development cost. Let me now turn the discussion over to Doug for a more detailed review of our markets and performance. Douglas T. Linde: Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. I'm going to start just with one brief comment on asset sales because I think it's important to reiterate. So last year, we sold about $1 billion of assets. And I would say, we had some pretty robust discussions about the near-term dilutive impact on our earnings and the accretive impact on our NAV of those decisions. And from the notes that I saw this morning, I think there's clearly attention in our earnings, in our short-term FFO numbers per share and the value that we are creating through the asset sale monetization perspective. As we move forward with these additional sales, I just want to reiterate why we're doing what we're doing. So we believe that targeted sales today provide a greater asset level of value creation opportunity in holding the asset, collecting the cash flow and then timing and executing on evaluation at a later date, which again is subject to both risk [indiscernible] of interest rate as well as future sales valuation. It's an opportune time to create asset level value. That's what we're doing, even though it's going to come with some short-term earnings dilution. And we obviously have a timing issue because most of our new investment opportunities, as Owen just described, involve development not immediate property acquisitions. So we will find ourselves, in all likelihood, with an inability to quickly redeploy that cash and, therefore, we create another special dividend opportunity. But that's really the rationale that we're using for what we're doing on a global basis. So let me talk a little bit about the markets now. It was an extraordinary 3 months in San Francisco. Year-to-date, there have been over 6.5 million square feet of leasing compared to about 9 million for all of 2013, which was a banner year. And it's been driven by large blocks from technology tenants that have really been forced to transition from what I would refer to as sort of a just-in-time real estate mentality to a long-term planning and decision-making mode of operation. The top 10 tech deals totaled 1.2 million square feet in 2010. The top 10 deals to date this year totaled 3.2 million square feet. So clearly, the tickets are much, much larger. A few weeks ago, Google joined LinkedIn as a Valley headquarters firm that's made the decision to expand in the city with its lease at One Market place and a purchase of 188 Embarcadero Center, 2 traditional downtown financial office buildings. Yelp, Splunk, Uber and, of course, Salesforce all made major expansion commitments during the quarter. We saw the law firm, Perkins Coie, who's a tenant in some subleased space at Embarcadero Center commit to Foundry III and with Google's lease at One Market, I think the stereotyping of where tenants want to locate becomes more and more difficult to predict, and the lines between what I refer to as tech buildings in tech locations and the traditional financial district assets really has begun to blend in a much more significant way. Activity at 535 Mission continues to be robust. We anticipate completion of the building in the fourth quarter, and we will have physical occupancy before the end of the year. We have leased another 2 floors, we're at 100,000 square feet, and we have active proposals with 3 additional multi-floor tenants, all with 2015 occupancy, way above our expectations. We didn't have any additional leasing to report at Salesforce Tower, but I think the 700,000 square feet we do with Salesforce was a pretty good start. Construction is progressing. Our marketing center overlooking the site is now open and we're making lots of presentations. The competing new construction pipeline has speculatively been fully committed, with the exception of the 420,000 square feet at 181 Fremont, which again is a small floor place building, 13,000 square feet of floor. And now the activity has switched to landfill in the next wave of development. The purchase of Salesforce Tower's land 1.5 years ago was $140 in FAR foot. The current bidding on the 2 entitled Mission Bay sites, so these are entitled sites, sold by Salesforce, bidding sold by Salesforce, are rumored to be in excess of $250 per rentable space. We are now focused on a number of next cycle developments with the increase in land prices, new construction costs are probably pushing towards $900 a square foot. And the one important factor that everyone now is going to start to consider and is being written about in all the periodicals and, I'm sure, it's being talked about on all the calls for people who have California interest, particularly in San Francisco, is that, lo and behold, the voter 875,000 square foot prop and limit on new commercial office development is suddenly going to be a governor on additional supply. While there's a deep prospective pipeline of additional projects that have been conceived, once the prop and allocation bank is depleted, which everyone, I think, projects will happen within the next 12 or so months, future approvals are going to be severely limited. So depending upon growth in demand, this may create a scarcity premium in the market for office rents. Activity in Embarcadero Center is pretty restrained because we're at 95% occupancy. We completed 10 more deals this quarter totaling about 73,000 square feet. We continue to market the 3 great floors on EC4. And while we're in discussions with a few tenants, probably doesn't have a 2014 revenue impact. I think the sweet spot in the market right now for all transactions, Financial Center buildings, South of Market buildings is really in with a starting rent between $70 and $75 gross. But with the lack of inventory, landlords, including us, are really seeking to try and push rents. And we're asking in excess of $80 a square foot for our best space. We'll see if we get it. Incoming tenants have adjusted to the market given the inability of them to have to spend money and move if they make a capital decision to relocate. So we're feeling good about the prospects for -- in rental rate increases [indiscernible] California South of Market, California North of Market, California Financial District buildings over the next couple of quarters. Net rents in Embarcadero Center in the second quarter generate some statistics for the supplemental show a 24% increase on leases that commence during the quarter, which is in line with what we've been talking about, which is basically a 15% to 25% markup over the next number of quarters and years. Shifting to D.C. Our investment capital continues to be focused on new development. Construction at 601 Mass Ave is on schedule. We'll be delivering that building for -- to Arnold & Porter in October of 2015. We are moving forward with the design and permitting of 501 K Street in the district, as well as a 276,000 square foot office retail building and 2 additional residential buildings, with about 25,000 square feet of space, in the urban core of Reston. The earliest construction commencement for the Reston development, probably the third quarter of '15, and the K Street building is really going to be tenant-[indiscernible]. Now the greater D.C. market is probably the softest in our portfolio. Although as Mort said, Reston Town Center, which makes up 40% of our D.C. NOI, is outperforming the rest of the region in a big way. When you think about our markets, Boston and San Francisco and New York City really have a more diversified tenant demand, while D.C. continues to roll [ph] in the legal industry and government and federal contractors the bulk of its activity. The sequestration and the budget deals from last year are actually still being felt in the contracting community and the GSA through both the nonrenewal of expiring contracts and the densification mandated by the GSA. And if you read the various market reports that are coming out from the brokers, I think it's pretty consistent with this. We completed about 75,000 square feet of early renewals in Reston and about 75,000 square feet of leasing in D.C., but our critical D.C. activity right now, particularly in the CBD, is focused on retaining 3 major law firms that currently occupy about 800,000 square feet of space in our CBD portfolio, with 2017 to 2019 lease expirations. Now 70% of this portfolio was in JVs on a square foot and weighted basis. We've actually signed a Letter of Intent with the largest of these 3 tenants, and we believe we have an excellent chance of retaining the others. In total, they're going to be reducing their footprint by about 100,000 square feet or 13%. The good news is that the current in-service rents for the 3 leases is about $61 of square foot growth and we expect that the future rents are going to be 10% to 15% higher, each with their traditional D.C. 2% to 3% annual escalations built in. Now in each case, the tenants are going to be rebuilding their space and we're going to be providing swing space at reduced economics until the build-out's complete. So as we mentioned in our previous call, these transactions will result in some transitional downtime that's going to impact our 2015 and 2016 revenues from these spaces. In Reston, where we have no direct vacancy, no real inventory, there are a few tenants within the portfolio that for various reasons have put some sublet space on the market. So our leasing associates are spending most of their time replying to inquiries on how we can accommodate new tenants with direct or sub-deals on these spaces. We're actually in the midst of a 40,000 square foot take-back lease termination to accommodate a growing tenant in Reston Town Center today. Turning to New York. There are a lot of large transactions announced in New York City during the last quarter, with Time and Bonnie downtown, Stony in Midtown South, and Neuberger Berman at 6th Avenue and Blackstone's renewal at 345 Park. But I think the takeaway is that Blackstone was the only expansion. There's been considerable velocity, but the overall availability coupled with the activity, which is still driven by lease expirations has really not resulted in any real changes in lease economics in Midtown, with a possible exception of the very small high end market where availability is much more limited. At 510 Madison, we did 4 more leases, including 2 floor deals at over $120 a square foot. And we're now over 91% leased with 1 floor and 3 of other prebuilt suites available. We haven't increased our asking rents, but negotiating room has narrowed dramatically. Through the end of the second quarter, the level of leasing for space above $90 a square foot, which we referred to as the premium market in Midtown, is 40% higher than it was in 2013 at this time, with a dramatic pickup in the number of new leases versus renewals, which is a big change. Our primary focus in New York, like D.C., is on our tenant expirations between 2016 and beyond. We're actively involved with 6 law firms, leasing over 1.8 million square feet, on their possible renewals. While 2 of these firms are looking at possible expansion, the most are going to be looking for some kind of an occupancy reduction over the next 4 to 5 years. So we have 2 transactions that are sort of in the documentation stage right now, and they encompass about 350,000 square feet. And the result is going to be a net giveback of about 40,000 square feet in 2015. The space we're taking back again is going to be used as non-revenue producing swing space for about 12 months as the tenants rebuild. But on a combined basis, these first 2 renewals are going to result in a 15% roll-down on a cash basis and a 2% roll-down on a GAAP basis in '15. Now we actually expect these other transactions will all result in positive cash and GAAP roll-ups and that, in the aggregate, the total portfolio of 1.8 million square feet will see a significant positive mark-to-market as we get to the other 3 transactions. At 250 West 55th Street, we completed 131,000 square feet of leasing, including the lease with Al Jazeera. So at 750,000 square feet, we're now 77% leased. We have only 4 prebuilt suites remaining. So in addition to focusing on the 1- and 2-floor prospects, we fully expect to break some more floors and continue our prebuilt program in the high rise. At Carnegie Center in the New York suburban market, we continue to gain both occupancy and extended leases. During the quarter, we executed 4 more leases for 75,000 square feet and we've got about 300,000 square feet of expansions and new demand under discussion. We expect to be under construction with our new development for NRG towards the end of the third quarter. Turning to Boston. Overall, the Boston office market continues to improve, our development activities are continuing to advance and we have included 3 new projects in our development section of our supplemental, which I'll give you a little bit of color on. At the Prudential Center, we signed lease with Natixis for 130,000 square feet and they have the right to go up to 150,000 square feet at the base of 888 Boylston Street, so that's floors 4 through 8 or 9. This is our new 365,000 square foot office development, which is on top of 60,000 square feet of new retail, which will be integral to The Shops at the Prudential Center. In addition, we're planning a complete renovation of our quick serve food operation and potentially a 17,000 square foot second story addition to the portion of the Boylston Arcade. These 2 retail projects will have a cost of somewhere between $30 million and $40 million, and that's not included in our construction of progress just yet, probably comes on into the program next quarter. We have begun the temporary closing of a portion of the retail, which will eventually impact about 22,000 square feet in our food court and reduce our overall revenue in '14 and '15 before we reopen with an additional 17,000 square feet. Now current inline rents at the Prudential retail are in excess of $150 a square foot. At the Hancock Tower, we're 5 months away from the expiration of our State Street lease, which is going to result in 2 blocks of availability at the building. We'll have a 170,000 square foot block at the base, which we're rebranding as 120 St. James, where we are creating a second lobby and entrance dedicated to the low rise and designed to attract technology and other creative tenants with its larger floors and floor-to-ceiling glass. Now the tight conditions in Cambridge and the influx of startups in the Boston area have really led to a rising new demand for office space from a nontraditional user in Boston. Wayfair, which is an online home shopping retailer, has expanded at Copley Place. Sonus has relocated from Cambridge to the Financial District. Autodesk is moving from the suburbs to the Seaport. World Winter, which is the parent company of the Game Show Network and Rapid7, which is a security company, have expanded and moved to 100 Summer Street. The Cambridge Innovation Center, note the name, opened a second location in downtown Boston and WeWork has now 2 sites with over 100,000 square feet and is looking for additional locations. Lots of untraditional demand in the Boston market at this point. The other major block of the Hancock is at the top of the tower, 145,000 square feet, which we will get back once we move in E&Y down into 4 of the State Street floors in the lower third of the building. And that's going to occur in the middle of 2015. So a little bit of extended downtime. While we have a big pickup in vacancy, the average in-place rent for those 2 blocks is about $40 gross and our expected starting rent is over $60 gross. This quarter, we leased 140,000 square feet of Hancock Tower at an average starting rent of over $65 gross. The suburban market in Boston continues to be very active, led by expansion of the life sciences and the tech businesses. Large blocks of space have disappeared, forcing larger tenants to consider new construction. Rents in Waltham continue to rise, an average to mid-'40s for new construction. We completed just over 100,000 square feet of leases in Waltham and Lexington this quarter. And in addition, we signed a lease with Wolverine, parent company for a number of shoe brands, for 155,000 square feet at 10 CityPoint, which will kick off our 230,000 square-foot office building and 16,000 square feet of retail space. And just down the Street, we're starting a 16,000 square-foot stand-alone retail building with a future of residential/hotel pad site. We've signed 2 full service restaurant leases, totaling about 13,000 square feet, and while it's a small investment, it enhances the amenity base for CityPoint, where we have 516,000 square feet of existing office space; 1.2 million square feet of additional office density, including 10 and 20; as well as 1.3 million square feet of other space at this interchange. In total, our new developments added this quarter are about $425 million, not just the Boston stuff, and are anticipated to yield in excess of 8% on a cash NOI basis. In Cambridge, where we're 100% leased, we anticipate making our formal permanent submittal over the next few months for our new residential building, which we hope to start in the first half of '15. In addition to the residential development, we're working in concert with the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority in the city of Cambridge on a 600,000 square-foot office and 400,000 square-foot residential density increase at our Cambridge Center project. In the meantime, there are 3 major tenants looking for blocks in excess of 150,000 square feet of office and lab space in Kendall Square as we speak. Office rents, as exemplified by our recent early renewals, are in the mid 60s to low 70s on a gross basis, which is an increase of over 50% since 2012. To sum up, it's been one of the busiest summers we can remember, and we are really encouraged by both the level of activity we're seeing across the portfolio and the development opportunities that sit before us. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Michael E. LaBelle: Thanks, Doug. Good morning. I'm going to start with a quick recap of our performance for the second quarter. Our portfolio had a strong quarter. Same-store NOI was up 3.5% on a GAAP basis and 8.1% on a cash basis from last year. We have been projecting growth in our same-store, and it's primarily related to occupancy increases in suburban Boston and Princeton and at 510 and 540 Madison Avenue in New York City, as well as strong rent rollups on expiring leases in Cambridge and in San Francisco. We also have free rent burning off from prior period leasing that is driving some of the cash rent growth, particularly at the Hancock Tower, at 510 Madison Avenue, 399 Park Avenue and Patriots Park. For the quarter, we reported funds from operation of $1.35 per share, that was $0.02 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range. Our rental revenues were in line with our expectations, and we experienced about $4 million of lower than projected operating expenses. The majority of the expense savings were in repair and maintenance items, and we expect to incur most of them in the second half of 2014. So the savings will not entirely flow into the full year. We generated $1.5 million of better than projected development and management services income with stronger service income in our New York City building portfolio, and we brought online development fees associated with our 2 new joint ventures where we started construction at Annapolis Junction 8, and we have commenced permitting and design work at 501 K Street. We also had a little bit lower than expected G&A expenses due to higher capitalized wages associated with this quarter's leasing productivity and higher development activities. The combination of these items resulted in about $6 million or $0.04 per share of outperformance. However, it was offset by $0.02 per share of nonrecurring items, including disposition transaction costs and an adjustment to our noncontrolling interest in property partnerships of $2.4 million. Next quarter, the run rate of our noncontrolling interest in property partnerships is expected to return to about $19 million per quarter. As we look at the rest of 2014, we don't expect much change to our prior projections. Since the majority of our current leasing activity involves transactions with revenue impact in 2015 and beyond, the most significant change for the remainder of this year will come from our asset sales activity. As Owen mentioned, we're selling some of our flex buildings in Mountain View, our long-term government-leased Patriots Park portfolio in Reston and 2 land parcels. These assets are unencumbered and currently contribute annual FFO of $23 million or $0.13 per share. We anticipate closing these within the next 60 days, and the projected impact to 2014 is the loss of approximately $8 million of FFO or $0.05 per share. The in-service portfolio continues to perform with solid same-store NOI growth coming from positive mark-to-market on expiring leases and occupancy improvement. Our occupancy improved this quarter to 93%. However, due to the anticipated lease expirations, our occupancy is expected to tick down in the second half, an average between 92.5% and 93%, for the rest of the year, which is slightly better than our prior guidance. And just a few details, we expect to lose occupancy at The Prudential Center with Arnold Communications, who's vacating 180,000 square feet, which will be backfilled by Blue Cross Blue Shield, but not until April of 2015. We're also getting the 26th floor back at the GM Building at the end of this month, and we're losing about 100,000 square feet of occupancy in our VA 95 R&D Park in Springfield, Virginia. These known moveouts totaled 75 basis points of loss occupancy and are partially offset by anticipated positive absorption elsewhere in the portfolio. On a same-store basis, we project our GAAP NOI to improve from 2013 by 2% to 2.5%, an increase of 25 basis points at the low end from our last quarter's guidance. On a cash basis, we expect moderation from the second quarter results due to the aforementioned lease expirations, but we're still projecting strong same-store cash NOI growth of 5% to 6% from 2013. Our noncash straight-line and fair value lease revenue is projected to be $93 million to $99 million for the year, up slightly in connection with our -- in conjunction with our GAAP NOI guidance increase. We continue to enhance our development pipeline both in terms of adding new projects and leasing up our existing projects. This quarter, we added 5 new developments. They totaled 840,000 square feet and $425 million of total investment. In addition to 280,000 square feet of preleasing in these 5 new developments, this quarter, we also leased 95,000 square feet of space in our other office developments, which are now 70% leased in the aggregate. Our Avant residential project in Reston had a strong quarter. It absorbed 95 units and is now 55% leased. Nearly all of the office leasing in our developments is for lease commencement in 2015, so the projected 2014 contribution for our developments is really unchanged from last quarter. We project an incremental contribution to 2014 full year FFO from these projects of $28 million to $30 million. The FFO contribution from our unconsolidated joint ventures is projected to be $29 million to $32 million for the year. We generated stronger than expected development and management services income this quarter; and for the full year, we're now projecting $22 million to $25 million, an increase of $3 million at the midpoint. And for our G&A, our projections are unchanged and we anticipate 2014 expense of $100 million to $104 million. We project our capitalized interest to be higher than last quarter -- in last quarter's guidance due to the commencement of new developments that were not included in our prior guidance. This will lower our 2014 interest expense, and we now project 2014 full year net interest expense of $444 million to $448 million, an improvement of about $2 million from last quarter. For the remainder of 2014, our quarterly interest expense run rate is actually going to increase due to the cessation of capitalized interest for 250 West 55th Street and 680 Folsom Street by the end of the third quarter. Included in our second quarter results is $8.5 million of capitalized interest from these 2 properties. In summary, we are modifying our 2014 guidance range for funds from operation to $5.24 to $5.29 per share. Adjusting for the $0.05 per share of loss FFO from our asset sales, this equates to a $0.03 per share increase in the midpoint of our guidance from last quarter. The increasing guidance is from a combination of better than projected same property NOI, higher development and management services income, and lower interest expense. For the third quarter, we project funds from operation of $1.36 to $1.38 per share. I want to spend a minute on our outlook for 2015 because there are a couple of things Doug mentioned that are important as you consider 2015. The first item is the dilution related to our disposition activity. As I mentioned, our dispositions have a current annual aggregate FFO contribution of $0.13 per share. We lose a portion in 2014, so you can expect the reduction in FFO year-over-year to be approximately $0.09 per share. The second item is interest expense. Assuming we simply refinance the $550 million of 5.5% yield in unsecured debt we have expiring next year, at current market rates, our interest expense should decline. However, the projected reduction in cash interest expense is expected to be fully offset by a decrease in our capitalized interest because our 2015 development spend does not ramp up fast enough to make up for the development cost that we delivered in 2014. In total, we expect our net interest expense to be relatively static year-to-year. The third item is the impact of transition in the portfolio that will have a short-term impact on our 2015 occupancy and our same-store performance. As Doug detailed, in Boston, we expect to lose 315,000 square feet of occupancy at the Hancock Tower and we're taking a portion of the high-value Prudential retail shops out of service in 2015. In addition, we have another 100,000 square feet of vacancies coming at the Prudential Tower and 100 Federal Street. While this space is currently below market and upon releasing should result in higher income, we expect downtime during 2015. We also expect to complete early renewals with several large law firms over the next 12 months, which could result in 200,000 square feet of either vacancy or non-income-producing swing space for a period of time. Again, this is all highly marketable space, but we anticipate some income interruption in 2015. In general, we anticipate that we could experience an average same-store occupancy decline of 50 to 100 basis points next year, which would hamper our same-store revenue growth. On the positive side, the contribution of our development deliveries is projected to drive 2015 FFO growth. Even though, 250 West 55th Street will not be fully stabilized in 2015, as some of the leases will not commence until later in the year, we project revenue recognition from an average of 75% of the building versus 25% in 2014. 680 Folsom is now 98% leased with 440,000 square feet of leases that commenced this quarter and the remaining 70,000 square feet commencing at the beginning of the fourth quarter. 2015 will be a fully stabilized year for the project. We will also start to see a contribution from 535 Mission Street with our first tenant taking occupancy at the end of 2014. And last, The Avant project in Reston is projected to complete its lease-up by the end of 2014 and be fully stabilized in 2015. I also would like to cover the impact that our disposition program may have on our dividend. The sale of the 2 office assets demonstrate the significant value that we're able to create through the development, repositioning and releasing process. The projected gain is $140 million on an aggregate value of $413 million, which results in an unleveraged IRR in excess of 14%. If we're unable to defer the gains through future investments, we could have a special dividend of approximately $0.80 per share later this year. And to the extent we sell additional assets, that special dividend could be larger. We're not currently projecting any changes in our regular quarterly dividend. The only other item I'd like to mention is that we're planning on holding our next Investor conference this fall. With Boston having many of our new developments that we've just announced, as well as exciting future pipeline deals, we will be having it in Boston on September 22 and 23. You can all expect additional information from Arista on this shortly, and we certainly look forward to seeing everyone. That completes our formal remarks. I'd appreciate if the operator would open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first call comes from Michael Bilerman. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Owen, I think in your opening comments, you talked a little bit about pursuing some additional development sites and some acquisitions. You talked about $100 million in D.C. I was wondering if you can elaborate a little bit on the development opportunities and sort of where -- what markets they're in. Are they more mixed-use space than just pure office development, and sort of give us a little bit of sense of size? Owen D. Thomas: Michael, the answer to your question is varied. We're looking for new development and acquisition opportunities in all of our markets. We're not focused on any one particular market. I would say, the -- in San Francisco, we pursued multiple sites. I would say the acquisition activity that we have in San Francisco has been much more focused on development as opposed to existing product. In Washington, I mentioned, the smaller acquisition that we're working on. In terms of developments, we've talked about 501 K Street, which -- where we have a joint venture on a site and we're seeking an anchor tenant to construct that building. We also have developments that we are considering related to the Reston Town Center. In New York, we are looking at acquisitions and development opportunities. And in Boston, I'd say, we are probably a little more focused on executing the robust pipeline that we're working on as opposed to identifying any new projects that we haven't announced. It's a little bit all over the place. Douglas T. Linde: I mean, Michael, just to sort of reiterate what we said in past calls, so in Boston, we have the North Station development, which is in excess of 1.8 million square feet, of which we're -- we presumably will be a 50% partner with Delaware North, and that's a 2015 start, which is not in our numbers anywhere. There's been some reports about the conversations we're having regarding the -- what's referred to the 100 Clarence Street garage, which is a site that, in all likelihood, could support some additional development, and we're working diligently with Mass Department of Transportation on figuring out a way to untap a couple of those sites, and those are in excess of 600,000 or 700,000 square feet apiece. We've got another building at 10 and 20 CityPoint, which we could build and then there's another close to 350,000 square feet of permitting that we're going to be getting accomplished in August for another building associated with the site that we're selling. And then, as I said, we have the Cambridge development. So that's a pretty big pipeline in Boston. In Washington, D.C., as Owen said, 501 K Street is a development that we are drawing right now, and Ray and his team are making active leasing proposals, and we're optimistic that someone is going to step up and take a very significant portion of that and allow us to get started some time in '15 or 16. In Reston, we have the 2 major developments in the urban core, which is 275,000 square-foot of building, which I described, as well as the signature site, which is another 500-plus thousand square feet of residential, which given our success at The Avant, we're very encouraged by. And then we have the Gateway site, which is another 2-plus million square feet of incremental development on top of the 500,000 square feet that we currently have at what's referred to as Reston Corporate Center, our 250,000 square feet of Reston Corporate Center. So there's a lot of potential development right there. In New York City, John Powers, as we would say, is up to bat with a lot of pitches coming at him. And there are a few that we're moving forward with -- in an expedition -- expedited basis. We're not prepared to talk about where they are or what they are, but they're not insignificant in terms of size, hundreds of millions of dollars. And then, in San Francisco, in addition to the Salesforce Tower and 535 Mission and 690 Folsom Street, Bob is in active discussions with a number of landowners about what I would refer to as next cycle developments, which are developments that will be predicated on 2 things happening. One, the central SoMa business district plan being passed by the city's planning authorities, and then the way the city has to go about it allocating its development resources with regards to the prop M allocation, assuming, as everyone expects, that we're going to get into the situation where there's going to be a limit. So those are the sort of the short-term things that we're looking at, which I think is billions of dollars of development in its total capacity. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Right. And it sounds like certainly over the next 18 months, that clearly well over $1 billion could be added to the pipeline. Douglas T. Linde: Those are your words, but I'm not going to disagree with you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jed Reagan from Green Street Advisors. Jed Reagan - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : On the Trulia lease commitment of 535 and then maybe just in general, if you can expand on the types of tenants that are expressing interest in Transbay and 535 these days, and maybe what kind of timing you might expect for reaching 90% leased at those 2 projects. Douglas T. Linde: So, Jed, could you please repeat your question again because you got cut off at the beginning of it so I didn't hear the earliest part of it. Jed Reagan - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : The first part of it was just whether the Zillow/Trulia merger might have any impact on Trulia lease commitment there at 535? Douglas T. Linde: Sure. Trulia was the first lease we signed. And during their process of being acquired or merging, depending upon your perspective, with Zillow, they approved and signed a lease extension. And they're building up this space, as we speak -- expansion, excuse me. So our strong inclination is that, as Dave said, they're going to be running 2 brands. And Zillow has a relatively small office in San Francisco and that they will fully be occupying the space that they've taken at 535. With regards to the other demand at 535 Mission and the Transbay Tower, which by the way we don't call it anymore, it's called the Salesforce Tower, which is the way we should be referring to it. We are seeing what I would refer to as a number of the traditional legal financial services oriented lease expiration driven requirements -- the major banks and law firms. And then we are making presentations and having conversations with a lot of the -- what I refer to as the technology or the new economy companies that Mort was describing, that are growing exponentially in San Francisco. As I described, they're very chunky and they're very large, and everyone is looking forward from a planning perspective because they all see the day when there's not much in the of way of blocks of space available, and Transbay Tower happens to be the one place where, right now, there is a block of space that is available for occupancy. With regards to the -- when we get to 95%, if all the leases that we are in discussions with at 535 actually were to happen, we would be basically 95% before the end of the year. I can't tell you whether or not all those leases are going to occur, but we have active proposals out that encompass more than 100% of the available square footage, which is 207,000 square feet. Michael E. LaBelle: Although we may be able to sign those leases, they wouldn't commence the rent until mid to later '15 at best. Jed Reagan - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : And Salesforce Tower, you feel like you might be able to reel in another bigger tenant this year? Douglas T. Linde: We are optimistic about the market. We are -- we feel that Salesforce Tower is an incredibly exciting project. And we are in no sort of rush to lease the next space, but if a tenant comes along that is looking for a block of space and is prepared to have an economic discussion with us, we are prepared to do another lease. Jed Reagan - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : Okay, great. And just to follow up, some of your competitors have talked about the flattening of the Manhattan office market and sort of a general shift to the south and west on the island. And just curious if you can talk about the extent to which year you're feeling that in your portfolio. And then does it sort of change how you're thinking about your longer-term footprint in Manhattan? Douglas T. Linde: John Powers, do you want to take that one? John Francis Powers : Well, there is certainly a lot of activity in Midtown South. That's the hottest market in Manhattan and that relates very much to Owen's opening comment about the increase in tech in the more steady-state and some decline in the law firm with steady-state and are unchanging in the financial service industry. The high-end law firms, or high-end financial firms are still very strong in Midtown. And we see a very good market here in Midtown. We don't see the positive growth or the spillover to downtown is getting because it's price advantaged. Operator : And your next question comes from Jeff Spector of Bank of America. Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I'm here with Jamie Feldman, too. Our first question, I guess, is on the development pipeline. And can you just talk to us a little bit about the size you're comfortable with versus the risks of development? Douglas T. Linde: Sure. We've had this conversation, I think from time to time during our history, and I'll start with the following, which is we are opportunity constrained not capital constrained. We are a $30 billion enterprise right now. And at any one time, having a series of projects that are in different stages of development from conception to leasing to coming and going into service of a $1 billion or $2 billion is not something that we are at all uncomfortable with. We've described the issues associated with development in the past, regarding the issues with permitting, the issues with construction and the issues with leasing, and we feel like we are really good at managing all of those issues. And that on the leasing side, the issues associated with new development and the issues associated with lease expiration driven vacancy are not too dissimilar. And often times, the advantage is associated with new construction and the changes in the way people are using space and the attractive nature of being able to move into a new environment relative to -- in the example that we're dealing with right now, having to rebuild over a 12- to 18-month period of time and having to swing through it actually create an incentive and an advantage to development. So it puts us in a position where we feel even more comfortable taking the leasing risk on certain developments, particularly when we have a major commitment for a portion of it, a.k.a. 888 Boylston Street than we necessarily have with the risks associated with our \"availability in our portfolio.\" Michael E. LaBelle: The other thing to recall, Jeff, is that these developments cycle through. So for example, we have a $3.5 billion pipeline today, but $1.7 billion of it is delivering in the next 6 months or is delivered effectively. And by the way, those are primarily leased, 77% leased to 250. You're basically 100% leased to 680, which is the 2 biggest ones that are delivering. So again, when you think about percentage of overall company size, we don't anticipate it increasing to a level that will be significantly more than what it is now as a percentage of company at any one time. Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And then, just wanted to focus, I guess, on law firms. I mean, one of the -- obviously, one of the tenants that has been downsizing. We appreciate your comments on next year. With M&A picking up this year, I guess, we were hoping to maybe hear that some of the discussions have changed a bit more recently. Is that -- I guess, that's not the case. The law firms you're speaking with, they're still talking about downsizing space in the coming years. Nothing has really changed there. Douglas T. Linde: Well, Jeff, there are 2 things that are going on, okay. So the first is that any law firm, and I don't care whether they're in the M&A business or the patent and trade business or the litigation business, that has an installation that was built 15 or 20 years ago, by definition, is looking at the way they're utilizing that space very differently. And we talked about this before, law libraries and the way conference rooms are used and the more uniform nature associated with the way offices are built out and the lack of secretarial or administrative report stations[ph] -- that in itself is creating a reduction in the total overhead of occupied space necessary for a law firm. Then, there are, in fact, mergers and acquisitions going on within law firms. I mean, so some of those firms are growing. And then, there are business unit differentiations. So, as an example, firms that have -- maybe had a significant bankruptcy practice, probably are in more of a downsizing mode than those firms that are in the patent and trade and for a biotechnology complex, right? So as I said, we actually have, in New York City, of the 6 firms that we're talking to, 2 of them were actually looking to maintain the same amount of space and that's after rebuilding it. So that would imply some growth for a few of them. And then, we have others depending upon their business practices and how much space they have that are going in other direction. So I think that, any law firm that has an installation that's probably pre-2007 is -- can find efficiency. And we're still -- I refer to the sort of the sixth or seventh inning of the continuum in the law firm world of tenants moving through their footprints and getting to sort of what I would refer to as the right size environment. Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. I appreciate those thoughts. And Jamie just has one quick question. James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Yes, just a quick follow-up, if you guys don't mind. Michael, are able to quantify the FFO impact of the transitional leases in 2015? Michael E. LaBelle: We're not going to give guidance for '15 today. I think the challenge that we have is that I described that 500,000 or 700,000 square feet of space, which is over 100 basis points of our space that is going to be going through transition. So with that kind of occupancy loss, we do continue to have roll-ups, particularly in San Francisco, where we hope we will see positive absorption. In New York City, there is opportunity to grow occupancy. Then we'll have roll-ups in Boston. So if those may offset each other, we'll see, but it's some headwind to having real kind of same-store growth in 2015. Operator : Your next question is from John Guinee. John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Three quick questions. First, on your law firm deals, I guess, Doug, can you give us just a basic number in terms of price dollars per square foot for releasing costs, TI, leasing commission, base building upgrades, how that tends to be split between BXP and the tenant? And is there any security obtained in this day and age for those kind of capital commitments? And then maybe this is also yours, Doug, but if I look back at your land inventory, about 9 million square feet of developable square feet and then another 2 million of options, do you have sort of near-term plans to either develop or monetize those? And then the third question would be for our friend, Ray Ritchey, if he can talk about what's happening in the DC market excluding the CBD and excluding Reston Town Center with the opening of the Silver Line. Douglas T. Linde: Okay. So let me see if I can do this succinctly. With regard to leasing costs associated with major law firms in cities like Washington and New York, where it's most germane for our purposes, a new transaction, okay so it's kind of moving into a new installation. It's probably getting in Washington, D.C., a tenant improvement allowances of up between $100 and $110 a square foot, and in New York City, it's somewhere between $65 and $80 a square foot. In New York, we believe that the cost of a new installation is somewhere in excess of $200 a square foot when you factor in furniture cabling and everything else, and in D.C., it's probably somewhere in the neighborhood of $175 a square foot. So that is the sort of costs. These deals are all different in terms of what's actually going on, and traditionally, in New York City, there's free rent associated with the move for the build-out time, so to the extent that a tenant is in place and they're not getting free rent, there's a transition of those economics to either rent or into additional TIs, and similarly in Washington, D.C. And then depending upon the age of the building, there may or may not be base building improvements that are required. So as an example, a building like 599, we are undertaking a lobby renovation because we think it's the right thing to do for the building, independent of the lease expiration. And the building work that's being done on elevators, for example, is sort of outside of a change to the tenant improvement, so that's not part of those costs. And that's obviously amortized over the entire value of the building over a much longer period of time. And then there are cases -- in cases where a building -- in one of the buildings we're looking in Washington, D.C., we may do a major gut rehab and change the entire HVAC system because we think that the building has gone past its useful life and we think it's the right thing to do both for the tenant and for the building, and those costs would all be on our side of the equation. So that's sort of -- that's the first question. Raymond A. Ritchey: I would also add, Doug, of the commissions that are forthcoming on these transactions, well, the biggest change is we're seeing the law firms participate greatly in the commission. So the commission could be $25 to $35 a square foot, but the law firms are going to harvest back between $15 and $20 of that, so that helps offset some of the costs associated with the build-out through the law firms' participation of the commissions. Douglas T. Linde: So with regards to our land inventory, John, I think we are working through 2 things. One is, there are certain sites that we are aggressively developing, a.k.a. things like 888 Boylston Street. And then there are others sites that we are aggressively trying to sell. So as an example, we have a land inventory in Rockville, Maryland associated with our Tower Oaks project, and we are looking to actually have an agreement with a non-office building owner to convert that land and permit that land into a different use, stick-built or multifamily or single-purpose, single-family homes, and we would be selling some of that land in manners like that. Again, we're selling a parcel out at the Broad Run project. We're selling a parcel of land that we have in Waltham because we're getting a terrific price and it's improving the environment around it. So over time, I'd say, we are working through that, and then a lot of that land, we hope to develop ourselves. Raymond A. Ritchey: And your third question, John, regarding the DC market, were you're asking specifically about the Silver Line or just the market in general? John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Essentially, if you look at the core urban markets, Crystal City, Rosslyn-Ballston corridor, Tysons, with the Silver Line, Southwest, they seem to be surprisingly anemic, unless you can tell me otherwise. Raymond A. Ritchey: No, I would fully support that position. The vacancy in Crystal City and in Rosslyn is approaching 30%. And the recently announced CEB deal was a little bit of a head fake in that while they're going to take down half of the new JBG building, or about 350,000 square feet, the space they're leaving behind equal to the amount of space they're taking. And thus, JBG is going to add 300,000 square feet to the market. So this will push the availability vacancy rate in excess of 30% in Rosslyn. And then in Crystal City, Pentagon City, you have the TSA out with a major procurement that may continue to show some continued erosion in that market itself. So while the Silver Line, I think, is going to be great long-term, and specifically for us in Reston Town Center, is going to create that development opportunity that Doug mentioned earlier, that $2.5 million to $3 million feet, certainly, in the short term, the Silver Line has done very little to impact or improve the market conditions in the RB corridor or in Tysons Corner. Operator : Your next question comes from Brad Burke of Goldman Sachs. Bradley K. Burke - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I was hoping that you could touch more on what you're thinking on a potential for new JVs. First, are those included in the $1 billion of asset sales that you're think about for this year, or is that in addition to the $1 billion? And then, you said that they're likely to take the form of what you already did in Times Square. So should we be thinking about these mostly focused on New York office? Owen D. Thomas: Yes. It's Owen. So to answer your question, what we said about dispositions for this year is that we felt that they would be in excess of $1 billion, and we'll continue with that guidance. I referenced the Times Square joint venture that we did last year as an example of something that we might consider for this year. And to go back to the merits of that, we were able to -- we feel monetized a portion of an asset at a terrific pricing. We retained the leasing and the management of the building, and we also retained the upside that was in the interest of that we owned. And then lastly, no, I wouldn't say that we would consider joint ventures only in New York. We might consider our own assets outside of New York as well. Bradley K. Burke - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the decision pool, The Avenue off the market. I realized that you can have issues with any given buyer, but what's the thought process on completely pulling it off the market versus just trying to line up a different buyer? Raymond A. Ritchey: Well, I think -- this is the Ray. We're considering the overall position of The Avenue book, the office building and the apartment building. And while -- let's put it this way. Our discussion with the current buyer has ceased. And we're evaluating where we go forward either with the buyer that has been considering the properties for the last 2 or 3 months, whether we take it back to the market or we continue to own it for the long haul. I mean, listen, it is a phenomenal asset that continues to perform in the best location in Washington D.C., and this was not a -- this was clearly trying to take advantage of industry environment and the interest from a capital markets for trophy-level properties like The Avenue. And certainly, nothing has happened that has distinguished that or altered our approach towards in our viewpoint of that asset. Operator : The next question comes from Vance Edelson of Morgan Stanley. Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Following up on an earlier question. Outside of West 55th there's no other New York development currently underway. And you mentioned you're looking at other opportunities, but given that New York is one of your largest markets, the fact that it's clearly at present not one of your larger development markets, is that just a matter of timing? Could it one day be one of your top development markets? Or do you think you just have better long-term opportunities in other cities? And related to that, is expanding into another district in New York City -- I think you touched on that a little bit earlier, but is that a realistic near-term possibility? Douglas T. Linde: As a public company, we've developed $3 million square-foot towers in Midtown Manhattan, and we think we've been highly successful at creating value to that process. We have a new Regional Manager in the form of John Powers, who has I think both a desire and an expectation to dramatically ramp up our activities in New York City, commensurate with the opportunities that he can find. And there is a significant desire to extend and expand our New York City outreach in terms of development as well as other types of transactions. And we've discussed in the past that we would consider doing residential, not unlike what we're doing in Washington and we're doing in Boston, at this point on a new development perspective as well. And again, as we said earlier in the call, we're opportunity-starved, not capital-starved. And so, we're focused on trying to grow that. Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. Good to hear. And then, shifting gears, could you discuss retail strength in Boston and the inclusion of retail in your projects like 888 Boylston, how integral is retail to the overall appeal of the project? And then longer term, do you see the non-office mix for BXP -- you just mentioned residential, but do you see the non-office mix with resi and retail moving any higher than it is currently? Douglas T. Linde: So, I'll break this into suburban and urban, okay? So from an urban perspective, having the right cachet associated with any of the buildings that we have in the form of what I would refer to as amenity-driven retail is pretty important. But when you're in the city, you also happen to be in a network where there are a lot of alternatives, right? So there are restaurants and dry cleaners and drug stores and hard goods and soft goods sellers of other things that are around that. The Prudential Center in itself is very different because it is effectively a regional mall in an urban location. And it's one of the highest producing productivity malls that we're aware of. I mean, it's over $1,000 a square foot, and it sells per square foot. An it's got both soft goods as well as restaurant and ancillary products and hard goods like -- Microsoft has a store here. Well, as we think about new developments across all of our markets, we are exceedingly aware that the old idea of having a suburban office park with a cafeteria in it is not the ideal mix for a tenant and a group of tenants that want to go into a location like that. So where we can, we're amenitizing and providing as much in the way of additional services to our customers, our tenants as we possibly can. And in the case of, for example, what we're doing in CityPoint, creating restaurants that have a full-service menu, where you can both get breakfast, lunch and dinner and have a cocktail after 6 :00 at night or whatever time you want to have your cocktail, is a pretty big draw for those tenants that are looking for an environment where they're trying to recruit and retain the best employees. And relative to going to a suburban office building that it really doesn't have that availability, it is a strong advantage and something we are acutely trying to bring to as many of our properties as we possibly can. And if you think about the cluster that we have, we talked about trying to create these clusters of great place, great space. And so it's a pretty strong focus of what we are trying to do, but we are not trying to become a major retail owner of space in an absentee perspective aside from how we're dealing with our office buildings. Bryan J. Koop: Some additional discussion on the retail. This is Bryan Koop. At The Prudential Center, as Doug mentioned, we're performing already at over $1,000 a square foot. We're very fortunate that we have a considerable role coming up. We have an opportunity to take -- we're performing at $1,000 a square foot. And that's what many performers and they're at $400, $500 a square foot. There's going to be opportunity to bring new, exciting retailers to produce at higher levels. And then when we look at 888, it's a really great, perfect combination of being able to support that building, but also enhance, call it, with greater destinations on Boylston Street for the rest of The Prudential Center. So we're really optimistic about the next few years of retail at The Prudential Center. Operator : Your next question comes from Ross Nussbaum of UBS. Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : I'm just curious. A number of your peers have been quite active on the Manhattan street retail scene. And I don't want to say you guys have been noticeably or notably absent because you do obviously have some street retail in a couple of buildings, but you haven't done any one-off deals. Could you just give us your perspective on that niche of the market and how you're thinking about it going forward? Douglas T. Linde: This is a not terribly well-informed answer, but I'll give you my perspective, and others may have a different one, which is we have not focused on buying individual condominium interest in high-value potential long-term lease rollover Manhattan, Fifth Avenue, Madison Avenue, Broadway, and Times Square retail as a strategy, because we're focusing on trying to put dollars to work in the office residential business in bigger volumes than that. It doesn't mean that we don't think there's an opportunity to create value there. I mean, as you said, we have, in excess of $60 million of revenue, and most of it is NOI. It's just that the 767 Fifth Avenue, that's the General Motors Building, and we have a 100,000 square feet of space there, so we have a pretty significant, relatively speaking, volume of that. And we are working really hard right now figuring out ways to significantly enhance the assets that we have on the 53rd and Lexington and Park corridor, a.k.a. 601, the Citibank -- the former Citibank building, as well as 399, to really create value and significantly increase the revenue potential of the street-level retail in those buildings. So it's not that we're not thinking about it. It's just we've not been focused on going out and buying a sort of one-off and creating a business like that. Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. And the second question I had was on Reston Town Center, and specifically given the pricing that you achieved on Patriots Park, and what I consider Reston Town Center to be, which is kind of an oasis in the middle of a suburban D.C. office desert, is that an asset you've ever considered selling or JV-ing and focusing your efforts in D.C. sort of in a more high-rise urban footprint? Raymond A. Ritchey: I'll answer that one. This is Ray Ritchey. And by the way, I'm in the Boston office today. I mean, it's just magic. It's just wonderful to be up here with these people. I can say that from our perspective in Washington that the Reston asset is a core asset not only today, but the future of that specific region is very much sized to the continuous success of Reston Town Center. And that while we are an oasis in a desert, we are a very large oasis and dominate the market. And we see even in times of softness in the surrounding markets, our ability to continue to outperform, and this is before the metro comes. And any future supply that will have a similar type of amenity base, and thus attracts them to the tenant, we control. So this is the market that we dominate today and we'll dominate in the future. And others in this table may have a different opinion, but they'll get a stronger argument against the Washington contingent, if that's in fact the case. Douglas T. Linde: I'd just put it in a slightly less personal context, which is that we believe that there continues to be an opportunity for strong growth in the Reston market. And that's both for the appreciation of the cash flows in the existing assets, we reinvest in those assets and make them better -- a.k.a. from what we're looking at doing, for example, with the retail in Fountain Square. And then we have -- as I suggested, we've got 750,000 square feet of immediate development, and we have another 2 million to 3 million square feet of longer-term development until we look at what we can create and what we can grow, invest in. And I guess, to the extent that at some point, we felt there was no growth left in it, we feel differently. But right now, our crystal ball tells us that this cluster in this particular location has a really strong long-term growth prospect, and that it's the kind of place we should be investing on money and see strong increases in our cash flow over a long time period. Raymond A. Ritchey: Also, the past part disposition was a long-term 20-year lease. So real upsize for a long period of time at a very attractive capital environment. So that was more -- but the sale was more opportunistic and not indicative of the company's commitment to Reston. Operator : And your next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill. Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : Two questions here. First, maybe it's for John. But as you guys look at New York, just given the way land pricing has gone, are you still able to sort of find deals where you can outright own the land? Or are you increasingly looking at ground lease situations? And, by extension, are you also having to look at situations where it's either a combination with residential or hotel to make the numbers work? Just sort of curious just with the bid from condos, curious if straight-up office deals, fee simple ownership, still if you can make them [ph] and sell. Douglas T. Linde: John, do you want -- he addressed the question to you, so John Francis Powers : It's a very difficult market. There's a lot of money-shaking deals here, and it's very difficult. So my approach is not to focus on the books that I get but to try to be innovative and proactive in the market and look for other type of opportunities. And I think we're making some inroads, but nothing that we can announce here. Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : Okay. But do you think that we'll see either ground lease situations or mixed-use situation, as you announced, future New York or borough deals? John Francis Powers : I would say, we're open to all of that. Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : Okay. And then for Ray, if you can just give some color on the D.C. acquisition. Maybe I missed it in the MD&A. But is this a redevelopment play? Is this a major lease expiration, where the reason you're buying it is because you're comfortable you've got a tenant to back that. So just sort of curious, some color on the D.C. acquisition. Douglas T. Linde: This is Doug. We don't feel comfortable talking about what the D.C. acquisition is at this point because it's an off-market letter of intent that we're approaching, and obviously it's a transaction that Ray has found that we think there's great long-term value creation opportunities on, but it's not appropriate to talk any more about it at this point. Operator : And your next question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : I just wanted to take the other side of Ross' question, if I could. I'm just curious about in terms of D.C., you've got this oasis in Reston that seems to have this natural barriers to entry. Whereas, in the district, there don't seem to be huge barriers to entry like we see in some of the other cities that you're focused and even in Reston with construction continuing in some big potential sites. What are the thoughts surrounding sort of paring that portion of the D.C. exposure and maybe concentrating more in Reston? Douglas T. Linde: So let me just give you some historical context about what we've done in D.C. because I think it's important in answering the question. So the vast majority of our holdings in D.C. were done through development, ground-up development, where we have found either sites or landowners who had sites, and we've done joint ventures with those parties in order to be in the value creation business on a long-term basis. There have been 1 or 2 acquisitions that have been done in what I would refer to as transitional times when the capital markets were struggling and we had the availability of funds to buy buildings at very, very attractive valuations, where we felt we could reposition those assets, or honestly, wait until the leases rolled and just mark-to-market over a period of time. And that continues to be where we are focused in Washington, D.C. Interestingly, we have actually done a significant amount of pruning in D.C. over the time that we've been a public company as well. We sold 1301 New York Avenue last year. We've sold -- we're in joint venture with a significant number of our properties, so we sold the joint venture interest in Metropolitan Square when we did our 901 New York Avenue deal. We sold one of our major assets in the Southwest of the city 10 or 11 years ago. Raymond A. Ritchey: The Marketing Center. Douglas T. Linde: The Marketing Center [ph], which is in the suburb. So we continue to be thoughtful about the long-term opportunities to create value in D.C., as well as what the appropriate exit point is for particular assets. Raymond A. Ritchey: I mean, we're underway right now, Jordan, as you know, with 601 Mass. That's a site that we controlled 5 years ago with a lease back from NPR, built their new headquarters. The project is 85% lease-free activity, doesn't deliver for another 15 months. the cash on cash return, that's going to be mid 8 unlevered when it's delivered. So while Washington continues to be challenged, at risk of sounding self-serving here, we have continued to outperform the market not only in Reston, but also downtown. And we're planning a really good defense on the 3 major renewals we have. We're very, very optimistic about our own chances of success of keeping all 3. So while Washington has had a little bit of dip in the last 2 or 3 years, and relative to barriers to entry, that pesky height limit keeps those buildings at 11 or 12 stories. So for us to deliver a $1 million square foot tower that you see in the other 3 markets, it takes $4 billion or $5 billion to meet that level of supply. So we're still bullish on D.C. and specifically very bullish on Boston Properties' position in that market. Operator : And your last question comes from Michael Bilerman of Citi. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : It's actually Manny here with Michael. Just thinking about -- you mentioned 2015 cash NOI growth. I was wondering what the spread between the cash and the GAAP may be given the burn-off of free rents and other things. Michael E. LaBelle: There still is a GAAP, so we still do have free rent burning off in some of the same-store from some of the leasing that we've done. I don't want to describe right now what the amount of that GAAP is, but there still is some more in there. I do -- I would expect the same-store portfolio, the noncash rent to be lower in '15 than it was in '14, although we will have noncash rents in our development portfolio that actually will probably be higher than in '14. But if you just look at the same-store, it would be lower. Operator : And at this time, I would like to turn the call back to management for any additional remarks. Owen D. Thomas: Okay. It's Owen Thomas. Let me just summarize by saying hopefully we've been able to demonstrate to you how busy we are at the current time given all the projects and activities going on. We feel we had a strong second quarter operationally. And we made significant progress executing the long-term strategy that we've been articulating to you. Thank you for your time and attention. Douglas T. Linde: Thank you, guys. Operator : This concludes today's Boston Properties conference call. Thank you again for attending, and have a good day.",

During the question-and-answer portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, our Executive Vice President of Acquisitions and Development, and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Mort Zuckerman for his remarks. Mortimer B. Zuckerman: Good morning, everybody. We are in the midst of a kind of a strange overall economy that is puzzling in terms of where it's going and how strong it'll be. J.P. Morgan Chase came out with a fairly bearish assessment of the economy this year and in future years looking forward. They called it the 1% economy because their projecting the rate of GDP growth over these years will be in the order of 1% or 1.25%. The good news, from our point of view, however, is that in the markets that we are in, we are seeing something a little bit stronger than that. This doesn't mean we aren't affected by the overall mood of the economy, because certainly it is not -- it is uncertain at best and pessimistic at worst. But in the markets that we are in, frankly, we're still finding a good deal of activity, particularly in the projects that we have, a good deal of activity in the buildings that we have. And in the developments that we have, we're still seeing action, all of which we will be covering in this call. Nevertheless, I think we all have to be aware of an overall economic environment that is not the most positive. There's a great deal of uncertainty in the business community because of the anxiety over the national leadership, I would say, is one dimension of it. But the real thing is that American business, I think, has slowed down and its capital spending. Employment growth has been much weaker than a lot of people expected. GDP growth has been a lot weaker than lot of people expected. So we just don't know for sure where this is going, but there's a lot of uncertainty in it. Nevertheless, as I say, in the markets that we're in, which if I could put it in colloquial terms, these are the 1% of the markets, these are the best markets in the country, at least as far as we know. We're still seeing a fair amount of action and a fair amount tenant demand and a reasonable solidity of the balance of demand and supply. We will be covering this during this call, but in general, I think we are modestly comfortable with where we are, although a little bit anxious about how the overall economy can affect the markets that we are in. So far it's had some effect but nothing to the point where we are kind of discouraged about it. With that, I will stop and turn it over to my colleagues. Owen D. Thomas: Okay. Thank you, Mort. Good morning, everyone, this is Owen Thomas. I'll touch briefly on the operating environment, our third quarter performance and capital strategy. But Doug and I want to leave substantial time for Mike this morning, to discuss our 2015 forecast, which, in addition to our earnings, is a primary new information we're communicating to you this quarter. Further as you know, we hosted a well-attended investor conference in Boston on September 23, which involved a very thorough review of all of our current activities and showcased a broad group of our professionals. And I'd I just like to remind everyone that these presentations and a webcast are still available on our website. So, starting with the environment, Mort touched on this, maybe I'll put a few numbers to Mort's remarks. The U.S. GDP growth snapped back in the second quarter, to about 4.6%. However, most forecasters, today, are forecasting growth to settle in the low 2% range over the next few quarters and for the year 2014. Growth is positive, but it's certainly not robust. The unemployment rate has also improved, marginally, to 5.9%. As we've been describing in prior quarters, economic growth continues to be uneven across our markets, as San Francisco, Boston and parts of New York are experiencing strong growth, driven by technology and other creative tenancy. While more traditional markets like downtown Washington, D.C., which are driven by government, financials and law firms, are experiencing much more difficult leasing conditions. I'd also like to touch on the recent market volatility. Given recent disappointing global economic growth numbers, particularly in Europe, political unrest in various points around the globe and other factors, the financial markets experienced highly elevated levels of volatility over the last month. And the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate has dropped another 20 to 30 basis points to around 2.25%. This increased volatility has not had any impact on our operations or leasing activities. Though perhaps a little early to call, given sales transactions recently announced and discussed, it would appear the real estate capital markets remain active and aggressive. In fact, we believe we could experience even more enhanced asset pricing in the market place given lower interest rates. Moving to our results for the third quarter, we performed well and made good progress in the execution of our business. As you know, FFO for the third quarter was $1.46 per share, which is $0.09 above consensus forecast, though there are some nonrecurring components that Michael discussed. We completed 89 leases in the third quarter, representing 1.9 million square feet space, with the Boston and New York regions being the largest contributor. This level of leasing activity, at 1.9 million square feet, is roughly 50% higher than our quarterly averages, and is being driven by new activities as well as early renewals of several significant law firm tenants. Our in-service properties in the aggregate are 92% leased, down 1% from the end of the second quarter. However, our occupancy is flat and in line with expectations if you exclude 250 West 55th Street, which was placed in service this quarter. Lastly, we made significant progress executing our assets monetization plan and development pipeline, which I'll discuss in greater detail. Moving to capital strategy, our capital strategy remains consistent with what we've communicated at our Investor Conference and in prior quarters. Given that prime assets in our core markets are trading at higher prices per square foot and lower yields than where we can develop, we have recently been net sellers of real estate while reinvesting raised capital into new development. The pursuit of acquisitions remains active but challenging. New investments considered today usually have some type of competitive angle for us, such as providing tax protection through the use of operating partnership, even if it's consideration; working with a financial partner or involving properties with a development or redevelopment component where we add value to our expertise. We made very significant progress in our disposition activities in the third quarter. As you know, in September, we announced the sale, to Norges Bank, of a 45% interest in each of 601 Lexington Avenue in New York and Atlantic Wharf and 100th Federal Street in Boston, for an aggregate sale price of $1.8 billion. The pricing represents a 3.8% cap rate on 2015 NOI, $1,073 per square foot, and a total return on invested capital to Boston Properties of 15.5%. The transaction will raise $1.5 billion in proceeds and is expected to close later this week. Combining this transaction with the Times Square Tower joint venture, we completed last year, we now have our $5.5 billion of assets in joint venture with Norges Bank, one of the largest sovereign wealth funds and most active real estate investors globally. We also completed, this last quarter, the planned sale of Patriots Park in Reston, Virginia, for $321 million, which represents a 5.2% cap rate, $455 a square foot and a total unleveraged return to shareholders of 11.5% over 16 years. With these 2 transactions along with the sale of 5 additional smaller assets, we will have sold $2.3 billion of real estate in 2014 versus a target of in excess of $1 billion. These 7 transactions were executed at an average cap rate of 4.25% and will raise $1.9 billion in proceeds to be used for investment in our robust development pipeline where we are forecasting initial returns in the 7% range, as well as a to-be-determined special dividend. We do not anticipate any additional significant dispositions in 2014, but we'll consider further sale activity in 2015. Depending, of course, on capital needs and market conditions. We continue to emphasize development for our new investment activities given the opportunity we see to recycle capital from the sale of our older buildings into new projects with higher returns. In the third quarter, we delivered into service 250 West 55th Street in New York, which is 77% leased, and 680 Folsom Street in San Francisco, which is 98% leased. Our active development pipeline now consists of 10 projects representing 3.3 million square feet with a total projected cost of $2.1 billion, down from $3.6 billion at the end of the second quarter. Our development pipeline is, in the aggregate, 54% pre-leased. Though no new projects were added to the active pipeline in this past quarter, we continue to be in a pre-development stage on another set of projects with strong potential in all our markets, most significantly our North Station project in Boston. In the aggregate, our share of these project represents an additional future pipeline of over $1.2 billion in gross development cost. Let me turn it over to Doug for a review of our markets and operating performance. Douglas T. Linde: Thank you, Owen. Good morning, everybody. I also want to add my thanks to everyone that made the effort to come to Boston and/or listen to our webcast last month. That conference every 3 years, and our objectives are pretty simple. First, we obviously want to provide you guys with an update on our activities in our market conditions, but what that conference really does is it allows us to showcase the depth of our regional management teams, and it provides you with some visibility on the people who are actually doing all the heavy lifting on a daily basis. And I hope, visually, when you see some of those projects, a.k.a. the things that we did out in Bay Colony or when we took over Cambridge. It really illustrates how we create and protect value. The emphasis was obviously on the Boston region this time, but it's what we do throughout our organization. It really is true that identifying the opportunities and challenges inherent in the individual assets; and creating the right plan to position them; and making speculative capital investments, those are the hard decisions, but it's what we do all the time; and it's our execution that really is key to outperforming the market. So we just hope you came away with a much better understanding how we have developed both our brand and our approach to managing, leasing, developing and when acquire -- acquiring assets. Given that I provided a pretty up -- rigorous update on the market conditions during the conference, this morning my remarks are going to be focused on the backdrop to Mike's forecast for 2015. So we're seeing another good quarter from an earnings perspective. Corporate America's balance sheets are very strong. When we look at venture capital investing, interestingly, if you look at what happened in the first 3 quarters of 2014, we've already surpassed the annual amount of venture capital investments for the last 10 annual years. So we've done, in 3 quarters, what we have done over the last 10 years on an annual basis. The Silicon Valley, New York City and Boston markets continue to obtain the largest share of those investments, a.k.a. those are the 3 markets that we talk about where there's the most activity and the strongest amount of overall demand growth. Big picture. Since last month, we really haven't seen any changes in our operating markets. So things still feel pretty good. During the first 3 quarters of '14, we've leased 5.6 million square feet of space, which already exceeds our annual leasing in 8 of the last 9 years. As you can see from our leasing stats that are in the supplemental, we're seeing strong mark-to-market on our recent transactions in San Francisco, Boston and New York, up 37%, 27% and 25%, respectively. While Washington D.C. remains weak, we are making good headway on our near-term lease expirations. As we begin our view of 2015 versus '14, I thought it would make some sense to provide you some color on the major factors impacting the year-to-year comparison as we experience major rollover in a few key assets and some visibility on where we hope to be when we get through these transactions. These are activities that we have forecasted over the past few quarters. So we'll start in Boston. At The Prudential Center, we are underway with 888 Boylston Street, and we expect to commence a 14,000 square foot addition to The Prudential retail, as well as a total renovation of The Prudential food court. Beginning in August of 2014, we began to terminate leases in the retail, and year-over-year we anticipate a $3.5 million to $4 million reduction in net operating income from that space. As we reopen the space beginning of early 2016, and finishing by the end of the that year, we expect to create an incremental -- so on top of the $3.5 million to $4 million, an incremental $4 million of annual NOI. At the Hancock Tower, our leases with State Street and Manulife will be expiring at the end of 2014, leaving us with about 414,000 square feet of availability beginning in the early parts of the year. In average, the in-place rent is about $43 per square foot, gross, for a loss of $18 million of NOI on an annual basis from the Hancock Tower in 2015. Our askoobing rent on this remaining block of space range from the low 50s to the mid-70s. So when fully leased, this space should generate annual revenues of about $25 million or a 39% increase. As a reminder, since the acquisition, we've completed more than 700,000 square feet of leases at the Hancock Tower, with an average markup of about 20%. We're also going to be going back 50,000 square feet of space at The Pru tower and another 52,000 square feet from Bank of America at 100 Federal Street. Offsetting this backup space will be the commencement of our 308,000 square foot lease with Blue Cross Blue Shield at 101 Huntington Avenue in April. In May of 2015, they have a staggered start. We also expect Bay Colony to move from 79% occupancy at the end of the year, or today, to about 93% by September of 2015. We don't have any vacancy in Cambridge, but nevertheless, we've already leased another 53,000 square feet of our 2015 expirations and 73,000 square feet of our 2017 expirations, at rents that are almost 25% above the in-place rents, but they're not going to show up at our numbers until the end of '15 and into 2017. We've been -- foreshadowing early renewals with our law firm clients in New York City. Our transaction with Weil was completed at the end of the third quarter. We will be taking back 3 full floors. The first in December of 2014 and the other 2 in December of 2016, where the current fully-escalated rent is about $90 a square foot. Our asking rent for these floors is over $150 a square foot, and we are in negotiations for the floor expiring at the end of the year. As is typical on a long-term lease commitment, the tenant will receive a period of time to build out the space, which will push revenue recognition into late 2015. Our second transaction is at 599 Lexington Avenue, again, another law firm, and we're going to be taking back 4 floors. We've leased 1 floor already and we'll be providing the bulk of the remaining space to another law firm tenant as free swing space for 12 months beginning January 1, 2015, limiting any revenues for the year. As we've discussed in the past, Citi has exercised their termination right on 173,000 square feet at 601 Lex in 2016. Well, we are already in discussions to lease up to 90,000 square feet of this space, and we're working with Citi on an early termination. This will accelerate the vacancy for 1 or more floors in 2015. Our newest assets in New York City, 510 Madison and 250 West 55th Street will contribute significant incremental revenue in 2015. 510 Madison is now 91% leased and 250 West 55th Street will see the lease commencement of 2 additional multi-floor tenants in March of 2015. The incremental NOI contribution from these assets will be about $36 million in 2015, based on current executed leases. We currently sit with 195,000 square feet of available space, with asking rents over $90 a square foot at 225 West 55th Street. We expect to finish most of the leasing in '15, but we won't see revenue until the very end of '15 or early 2016. In Washington, known GSA compression and law firm expirations will have an impact on our occupancy primarily in our joint venture properties. Overall, the D.C. CBD occupancy will end 2014 at about 96% and average 94% during 2015. In Reston, we have an unplanned vacancy due to the bankruptcy of NII Holdings in the Town Center. While they leased a 180,000 square feet, the net exposure, after taking into consideration subtenants and a reduction of their occupancy, will be about 63,000 square feet on January 1. The current rent is about $52 a square foot. We anticipate The Avant, our apartment building, currently 70% leased, should reach it's full stabilization by the end of March, with an incremental year-over-year contribution of about $6 million. In the Bay Area. 2015 will be very similar to '14 with very limited rollover. We're actively engaged with a host of full floor tenets with 2016 and 2017 lease expirations. Some of these renewals will be with law firms that are shedding modest space, but where we see significant opportunities for rental increases for both the renewal and the recapture space. We expect to end 2014 with about 6% vacancy at EC and to be flat at the end of 2015. The mark-to-market on our EC office portfolio stands at about 20% for all of the leased expiring in 2015 and 2016. We are close to 100% leased in our Mountain View assets, and with last week's announcement that Google had taken on an additional 2.9 million square feet of space through leases and purchases, we are optimistic with our ability to lease the 437,000 square feet of vacancy at Innovation Place, our Zanker Road project in North San Jose. When leased, this will drive an incremental $12 million of income. 535 Mission has received its certificate of occupancy and truly is expected to occupy their space in the next few weeks. We are in negotiations with other tenants for over 100,000 square feet, which should bring us to 67% leased before the end of calendar year 2014, with lease commencement early 2015. We would expect to achieve revenue on all of the space by June and are optimistic we can lease the bulk of the remaining space at 535, prior to the year end, with full commencement by the middle of 2016. All of the items I have discussed, however, are dwarfed by the impact of our 2014 sales transactions. Mike's going to discuss the earning impact of those transactions along with the geography of where it all appears in our future earnings. As we sit today, we would anticipate a sizable special dividend. The gain on sale from the sales activities is slightly over a $1 billion, but we are still working through some of the possible 1031 opportunities, and are finding our 2014 taxable income, which should impact the payout. We will be meeting with our board and will provide guidance on the dividend as soon as we have some clarity. Mike will now go through our results and our '15 guidance. Michael R. Walsh: Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. I'm going to start with a quick recap of our performance for the third quarter. As we been guiding you all year, our same-store performance continues to be positive. This quarter was strong, with same-store NOI up 3.8% on a GAAP basis and 5.9% on a cash basis over the third quarter last year. Our same-store occupancy was up about 20 basis points, though much of the better NOI performance came from higher rents and free rent periods burning off. As Doug detailed, we experienced large rent roll-ups in all of our markets this quarter, except D.C. Our lease transaction cost were also a little bit higher this quarter, they totaled about $46 per square foot, which is $6.50 per lease year versus our run rate, over the last few quarters, of about $30 a square foot. This was impacted by the large volume of deals in New York City which are longer-term but also carry higher brokerage cost. For the quarter, we reported funds from operations of $1.46 per share, that's $15 million or $0.09 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range. A big piece of the out-performance was nonrecurring items that totaled about $8 million or $0.05 per share. We received a $7.7 million distribution from the Lehman Brothers estate that related to our pre-financial crisis lease at 399 Park Avenue, which was terminated in bankruptcy and which we classified as termination income. We still have a remaining claim that has a value estimate of around $9 million, though the timing and the likelihood of collection of it is uncertain. We also recorded $1.7 million of termination income at Metropolitan Square in our joint venture portfolio, we negotiated the take-back of a floor from one of our law firms and immediately leased the floor, plus another vacant floor, to a new tenant. And the last item was $1.4 million in transaction costs we booked this quarter, related to our asset sales activity. The performance of our core operations was higher than our budget by approximately $7 million or $0.04 per share for the quarter. Our portfolio NOI was up $6 million and management services income up just over $1 million. The portfolio performance stems from the sale of Patriots Park, which occurred later than we expected and added $1.3 million, better-than-projected rental income spread across our regions of $1.7 million and lower-than-anticipated operating expenses of about $3 million. We expect half of our expense variance to hit in the fourth quarter, increasing our fourth quarter operating expenses. As we look at the rest of 2014, there are 2 key changes to our projection that will impact our full year guidance. The first is the impact of the sale to Norges of a 45% interest in 100 Federal Street, Atlantic Wharf and 601 Lexington Avenue. As we discussed at our investor call last -- investor conference last month, we entered into an agreement to sell a joint venture interest in the 3 buildings for $1.8 billion, which equates to a total valuation of $4.06 billion. As Owen mentioned we're on track to close later this week and the lost FFO for 2 months is $10 million or $0.06 per share. As a reminder, these assets will remain consolidated in our financial results. And the impact to our earnings will be reflected through an increase in noncontrolling interest. The second item is the anticipated redemption of $550 million of unsecured bonds that are expiring in 2015. We expect to notify the trustee, under our bonded venture, that we intend to redeem the bonds using our make-whole rights. The make-whole provides a 35 basis point discount compared to paying all of the remaining interest payments. This will accelerate the interest expense on the bonds from 2015 into 2014 and add $10 million to our 2014 interest expense projection or $0.06 per share. We now project our full year 2014 net interest expense to be $456 million to $459 million. The most significant change in our operating portfolio performance relates to our long-term renewal with Weil, Gotshal at the GM building. Weil, who currently occupies 485,000 square feet, is renewing in 390,000 square feet and will give back 3 floors in the upper third of the building. One floor on December 31, 2014, which Doug noted is under letter of intent, although the build-out time will take revenue recognition through to the end of 2015, and 2 floors at the end of the 2016. As you recall, the in-place rents at the GM building are significantly below market, so we will see an uptick in noncash straight line rents immediately, with the increase in cash rent commencing at their natural expiration in 2019. We also will accelerate the existing noncash fair value lease balance into income over the remaining shorter-term for the give-back floors. Particularly, with respect to the floor coming back in 2014, this has a significant impact and our noncash rent for the building will be $5 million higher in 2014 than our prior protection. We expect our occupancy to remain stable for the rest of 2014, the impact of the Weil renewal and the performance in the third quarter will show up in our 2014 same-store NOI projection. We expect same-store NOI growth of 3% to 3.25% over 2013 on a GAAP basis, which is up 75 basis points from last quarter. On a cash basis, we project 2014 same-store NOI growth up 5.5% to 5.75% over 2013, also better than our projection last quarter. Our noncash rents are projected to be $108 million to $110 million for the full year 2014. Our other projections for 2014, including for developments coming online, unconsolidated joint ventures, hotel and development and management services income result in no guidance changes from last quarter. We do expect to come in near the low end of our range for G&A expense and now project $100 million to $102 million in G&A expense for the full year 2014. So in summary, our out-performance in the third quarter of $0.09 per share, combined with improvement in our same-store projections, nearly offsets the loss of $0.06 of FFO from asset sales and $0.06 of higher interest expense from prepaying our 2015 debt maturities. We are tightening our guidance range for 2014 projected FFO to $5.24 to $5.26 per share, and we project fourth quarter funds from operations to be $1.23 per share to $1.25 per share. This is the time of the year that we start to talk about 2015 and provide formal guidance for 2015. And as you recall, last quarter we discussed a few items that would have a significant impact on next year. These include the dilution from our 2014 asset sales program and transition in our Boston CBD portfolio. Offsetting this is the full year impact of our 2014 development deliveries, which provides significant FFO growth. The asset sales have the most meaningful impact to 2015. In 2014, we expect to complete dispositions totaling $2.3 billion at a weighted average cap rate of 4.25%. The annualized FFO loss associated with these assets is $84 million or $0.49 per share. Now, a portion of the FFO loss occurs in 2014. So as you think about 2015, the sales will reduce our 2015 funds from operations by $65 million or $0.38 of a per share reduction in FFO year-over-year. As you think about our same-store guidance for 2015, we anticipate that our overall occupancy will decline early next year, due to the Boston move-outs, to near 90%. But then improve and average between 91% or 92% for the full year. 100 basis point of occupancy in our portfolio was approximately 420,000 square feet. The biggest impact to our 2015 same-store performance is in Boston. Where, as Doug noted, we have 516,000 square feet of expiring leases where we expect vacancy during 2015. Doug also mentioned the impact from the renovation of The Pru Center retail. The loss of occupancy is partially offset by the anticipated positive absorption in the suburban portfolio and also with Blue Cross Blue Shield moving into 300,000 square feet at 101 Huntington Avenue. In total, we project the NOI contribution from the Boston portfolio to be down by between $14 million and $18 million in 2015, which meets our same-store NOI growth in 2015 for the portfolio as a whole. We're projecting NOI growth in New York City, both from gains in occupancy at 250 West 55th Street, 510 Madison Avenue and 540 Madison Avenue, as well as from the roll-up on rental rates on some of our key lease renewal activity. In San Francisco, we project NOI growth from both occupancy gains and continued strong positive roll-up in our leasing. Given that we are 96% leased in the city and have just 260,000 square feet of leases expiring, our growth opportunities is somewhat limited in 2015. As Doug detailed, we are actively working on several of our 2016 expirations, where we have 900,000 square feet expiring at an average in-place rent of under $50 per square foot. In Washington D.C., we project losing about 200,000 square feet of average occupancy next year, resulting in lower same-store NOI. The market weakness in D.C. primarily impacts our joint ventures, as much of our D.C. portfolio is in our unconsolidated joint ventures. We also recorded termination income of $1.7 million this quarter at our Met Square joint venture that we do not expect will recur. So the 2015 FFO contribution from our unconsolidated joint venture portfolio is projected to decline in 2015 and total $22 million to $27 million. Overall, we project our 2015 same-store NOI, on a GAAP basis, to be relatively flat between negative 1% and positive 0.5% compared to 2014. On a cash basis, we project 2015 same-store NOI growth of between 0.5% and 1.5% over 2014. As Doug described our pending vacancy in Boston is highly marketable space, and once we re-lease it at market rents, we will see a nice increase in our same-store. In 2014, in our developments, we delivered 250 West 55th Street, 680 Folsom Street and The Avant, each of which has been in lease-up during the year. We're also delivery 535 Mission Street in San Francisco this month and 601 Mass Avenue in Washington, D.C. in the fourth quarter of 2015. These developments have a meaningful impact on our 2015 results, and are projected to add between $50 million and $60 million of incremental NOI to 2015. Our noncash straight line and fair value lease revenue is projected to be $80 million to $95 million in 2015, and we project our hotel to generate $12 million to $14 million in NOI in 2015. We completed a couple of large third-party development fee projects in 2014, including the Broad Center expansion in Cambridge and the George Washington University science center project in D.C. The completion of these jobs is factored into our 2015 projection for development and management services income of $15 million to $20 million for the year. This represents a significant decline in our third-party development fee income from the past few years, and as we illustrated during our investor conference, we have a robust development pipeline and we've been more focused on using resources to deliver our new projects than on third-party fee assignments. We will be generating management fees associated with our Norges joint ventures that are not included in this number. Since these joint ventures will be consolidated on our books, the management fees show up in our earnings through the computation of noncontrolling interests and are not included in fee income. We project our G&A expense to be relatively flat compared to 2014 and project expense of $100 million to $104 million. With the early redemption of our 2015 bond expiration, that have an average coupon of 5.34%, we anticipate that our interest expense will be lower next year. Given the large cash balances we'll be holding from our asset sales, we are not projecting additional financing in 2015. It's always possible that we may see an opportune window to hit the debt market. But at this point our cash balances are sufficient to fund our forecasted development needs for the next 2 years and we have no additional material debt maturities until the fourth quarter of 2016. Of course, we're constantly looking for new opportunities, including expanding our development pipeline that could accelerate our capital needs. For 2015, we project our net interest expense to be $415 million to $425 million. We project capitalized interest to be $40 million to $50 million in 2015, which is lower than 2014 due to our stopping capitalized interest associated with our deliveries of 250 West 55th Street and 680 Folsom this year. If you combine all of our assumptions, we project 2015 funds from operation of $5.22 to $5.42 per share. This represents an increase of $0.07 per share from 2014 FFO, at the midpoint, despite the loss of $0.38 per share of FFO from asset sales. If we had not elected to sell assets in 2014, our projected FFO midpoint would be $5.70 per share, equating to projected FFO growth of nearly 9% over 2014, which is driven primarily by NOI from our development pipeline and lower interest expense. That completes our formal remarks. I would appreciate if the operator would open up the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Steve Sakwa with ISI Group. Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Mike, if you sort of try and look at the quarterly progression of the way earnings are going to unfold -- and I realize it's a little early to even ask about 2016, but how would you kind of guesstimate the quarterly progression of FFO looks? And I guess, what I'm really trying to get to is, where do you think the run rate of the company is at the end of next year kind of positioning you for 2016? Michael E. LaBelle: Well, obviously, it's going to be lower at the beginning. Because that's when we're seeing our significant rollover in Boston, with 400,000 square feet of space. And our occupancy going down from where it is today by about 100 basis points, 150 basis points at the beginning of the year. And then we anticipate that we're going to continue to lease up that space through the year. I don't have the exact quarterly number in front of me but we're going to gain somewhere between 100 and 200 basis points of occupancy on our portfolio, which is -- our same-store portfolio is about 42 million square feet and the supplemental provides what the average rents on that are. Obviously our development, also, will have a significant impact on the growth during the year because a run rate today, on 250, where we got 50% of the occupancy that is revenue commencing. And we're going to get up to 78% based on existing signed leases by the end of the second quarter of 2015. And then we will continue to lease up the remaining 200,000-plus square feet, as Doug mentioned through the year, with the hope that we'll get revenue started on some of that stuff. Some of it is prebuilt during '15. And then there's 535 Mission, which, as well, is -- again, in lease-up, it is going to help us. So if you look at those developments, you will see an increase, through the year, of the contribution from those developments. Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. My guess it might just be something you want to think about trying to provide because I think there's a lot of lumpiness here. But it feels like the business is good and it's a timing issue and your exit the year on a much stronger footing. Michael E. LaBelle: Steve, I think that's a fair characterization. The business feels really good, particularly in Boston and in San Francisco, and in -- honestly, in New York City. Maybe not as much of a rental rate growth with respect to New York City. And we've got really high value-added vacancy that we've known about and we've been forecasting for the past number of quarters. And we will get it leased up and will probably get it up leased up at rents that are higher than what we are currently budgeting. I can't give you a crystal ball on the timing of it. We leased 2.5 million square feet of space in Boston -- or we will have leased 2.5 million square space in Boston calendar year 2014. And I would not be surprised if our leasing folks in Boston were highly successful at getting the 500,000 square feet of high-value space leased by the end of the year. Revenue recognition, different question, right? Is it going to be fourth quarter of '15? Is that going to be third quarter of '16? It's going to depend on the situation. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. And then I guess just the other question, for either you or for Owen maybe. Just as you think about asset sales and pricing in the market place today, how do you guys just think about potentially selling more assets, ala the Norges JV, as you look into 2015? I know you don't put in the guidance, but just kind of what are the drivers as you guys think about. Is it just the unsolicited offers and you make the buy/sell decision at that point, looking at kind of an un-levered IRR calculation? Or what prompts you to decide to sell those? Michael E. LaBelle: So, Steve, as I mentioned earlier, we don't anticipate anything further for '14, so your question really relates to '15. We put asset sales into 2 categories. One is assets we consider non-core, those transactions have probably been more in number, but certainly lower in terms of capital raised. And then the other are assets where we've been achieving, we think, pretty interesting pricing relative to the cash flow growth in the asset. So we have not -- and are certainly are not prepared at this point, to give you a forecast for '15, in terms of additional asset sales. But we clearly want to continue to work on our non-core portfolio. We have assets, again, that are non-core to the ongoing business. And to the extent that we can sell some of those for attractive prices similar to some of the deals that we've done in the suburbs, in Boston and in Maryland, over the last year. We're want to do that. And then we're going to continue to assess the capital market for the second category of buildings and our capital needs. Mike talked about the fact that we have a significant amount of capital to address our current pipeline of opportunities for the next 2 years, to the extent new opportunities are identified and there's more of a need for capital, that'll be another factor that we'll consider as we look at this. So I think the second category -- again, it's harder to predict and it'll depend on, again, capital needs and what's going on in the capital market and does this aggressive pricing continue to accelerate in the marketplace. Operator : Your next question comes from Emmanuel Korchman with Citi. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : If you look at the comment that you made in the earnings release on 415 Main Street in that purchase option. Can you just help us think about the dilution aspect of that in 2016? Given the high rents in that building. And I realize some of those related to amortization, but what's going to be sort of the '16 drag? Michael E. LaBelle: Sure. So, just to give you the history, so the transaction that you're talking about is a building that was once called 7 Cambridge Center, now our marketing folks have decided to call it 415 Main Street. It's a building that was built for the Broad Institute. It is a building that is leased to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As part of that lease back in 2004, when it was negotiated, they were dogmatic about the need to own this real estate at some point in the future. And so, we entered into an agreement where we would do 2 things. We would amortize all of their costs from the tenant-proven perspective, over the term of the lease, at 8%. And we would give them the right of purchase building at -- basically almost doubling our money over the 10-year period of time. So effectively, we built the building for about $60 million and we're selling it for $106 million. I believe, Mike, correct me if I'm wrong, the rent on the office space was about $31 a square foot. And then rent on the lab, which is effectively the TI loan, was about $29 a square foot. So, net-net, it's about $70 or $60 a square foot that we will be losing in contribution starting in February of 2016. And it's it's a 230,000 square foot building. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Got it. And then turning back to future dispositions for a second. How much are you weighing the need for capital in doing disposition versus selling an asset because of favorable pricing and then doing something like a special dividend? Owen D. Thomas: Well, I'll give you the first answer. I think it's pretty clear that we are not, in any way, shape or form, doing things because we are in \"need of capital\". We sit on -- at the end of these sales we'll have $2.5 million of cash and we will have $1 billion under our line and we will also have reduced our debt, significantly, over the last few years. So from a balance sheet perspective, we are highly liquid and have great ability to raise capital. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Maybe I'll rephrase that and say use of capital rather than need for capital. Owen D. Thomas: No, I think -- it's Owen again. Both are a factor. Again, going back to the question a moment ago, more broadly about asset sales. The first category, the non-core, we want to continue to do that. We think, given the current capital market environment, its an opportunity for us to exit certain non-core assets if we can get appropriate pricing. And I think your question really relates to the second category, which are these larger transactions that we've been executing at what we think are very favorable terms. And we're going weigh both of those factors as we consider additional asset sales. What is the opportunity? What are the cash flow characteristics of the building that we would sell or joint venture and what would our potential capital needs be. And as Doug and Mike have pointed out. Right now, we don't have a significant near-term capital need given the sales activities that we conducted this past year. Operator : Your next question comes from Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors. Jed Reagan - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : Your cash re-leasing spreads jumped up pretty significantly in the third quarter. I was just curious if you think that's representative of the kind of spread you'll see in 4Q and 2015 or if you think that was more of a one-off. And maybe just, in general, if you could highlight where your portfolio in-place rents stand relative to market today. Owen D. Thomas: So I think that the direction that you saw in the third quarter was consistent with the direction that you will see in the fourth quarter and in early 2015. I think, overall, we would anticipate that the mark-to-market on most of our assets in San Francisco and in Boston are in the sort of 20, plus or minus, percent increases. The New York stuff is lumpier. As I have described before, we some of these larger scale re-leasing transactions that we're working on, where the rents are sort of flat. We have a couple of where there's a market increase in the rent, a.k.a. the wild got-you-alls of the world. And then there are a couple that, on a mark-to-market basis, are negative. I mean we have, for example, a couple of the floors that we're taking back this quarter from one of the tenants, the tenant was paying $130 a square foot on, and then the market rent is probably $95 to $100 a square foot. So net-net, New York City is somewhat muted. And so I think, depending upon the timing of those transactions, there'll probably be more variability in the New York City leasing than there will be in the Boston or the stuff that's going on in San Francisco. And then Washington, D.C., it's really interesting. The funny thing about Washington D.C. is it's not all in the leasing spreads. The rents, net-net, are not going down. They're not going up a lot but they're not going down. So you have 2 factors. You have the fact that Washington, D.C. leases traditionally have 1.5%, 2.5%, 2.75% annual escalations. So a rent was, at one point, $35 or $36 a square footage suddenly in the mid-40s, and the rent today is probably in the low 40s. So there is, potentially, a little bit of a muted impact on that. And then, where the weakness is really translated in Washington D.C. is on the concession packages. A new transaction in Washington, D.C., for our major law firm over 100,000 square feet, you're talking in excess of $100 worth of tenant improvement money and you're probably talking about 9 to 12 months of free rent. And those 2 things don't get factored into the rental rate. And so it gets somewhat muted there. Jed Reagan - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And you guys had talked, at the Investor Day, about an interesting New York City development opportunity, potentially in an area outside the midtown. Just wondering if there is an updates to share on that. Owen D. Thomas: It's still really interesting and it's still outside of midtown and it's, unfortunately, not at the point where it's something we can talk about publicly. Operator : Your next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I'm hoping you could talk a little bit about leasing progress at Salesforce Tower and just your latest thoughts on San Francisco. Owen D. Thomas: Sure. Bob Pester, do you want to take that one? Robert E. Pester: Sure. We are making several presentations in the last couple of weeks. They range from anywhere from 1 floor to a user up to 250,000 square feet. We think the activity is very good, based on the status of the project right now, where we are just digging the hole. And we're optimistic that we will continue to lease space during the course of construction. Whether or not we'll have most of it leased or just some of at leased at completion remains to be seen. But we're very optimistic on the activity. James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And have you seen any change in demand or change in sentiment given some of the earning issues we've seen from some of the tech companies the last couple of weeks? Owen D. Thomas: No, not at all. Not at all. In fact if you look, Uber, Yelp, several of the large tenants that have been in the market continued to take space. I mean, Uber just took another 80,000 square feet on top of the 400,000 that they announced last month. So we're very optimistic as far as the activity that we're seeing. James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And then I guess a question for Mike. I don't know if you know the numbers or run the numbers. But if you were to back out the Boston transitional vacancy, do you know what your same-store would look like next year? Michael E. LaBelle: Well, I mean as I -- the same-store is about $1.4 billion. So we're losing $14 million to $18 million. So it's a 1% rough difference to 1.5% rough difference if that was not there. And then as Doug mentioned, you lease it up to the market, right, you're going to add another 40%. So another $8 million or something like that to that income. I would add, just to your question on San Francisco, it's interesting on some of the tech company earnings announcements. Most of them are expense related because they plan on hiring more people. I think that bodes, actually, well for San Francisco. James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay, all right. And then one last question. Hotel multi family same-store was down year-over-year. Can you talk a little bit about what's going on there? Michael E. LaBelle: I think the hotel was up a little bit. It had better rate than we anticipated. And the residential market was primarily due to The Avenue, which, from 2013 to 2014, has seen a reduction in the rental rate that we can get. And you can see in the supplemental, it'll show you what the rates are from period to period. And that's really what's driving that decline. James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : And do you see that turning? Michael E. LaBelle: I think that our projections are that it's going to be stable in 2015. We're not projecting significant decline. But there's a lot of product that has come online in that marketplace. Owen D. Thomas: Jamie, I mean, we are far from expert at where the Washington, D.C. market is with 1 property. I think our view, based upon our conversations with the folks who are doing the leasing, are that rates going to basically remain firm and we, hopefully, will pick up some occupancy. I'd say our occupancy went down more than we would have been anticipated during the move-out or around the end of the school year at G.W. And so we've done some things to sort of change the approach how we deal with that transition. And there is basically a total net-net neutral decision on where we're pricing the unit. But we are not a good barometer of the residential market in Washington, D.C. If you call in a half hour I'll probably do a better job for you there. Operator : Your next question comes from David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald. David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division : Just a couple of questions on concessions and leasing commissions for the quarter. They bumped up. Is that really a function of the mix or is there 1 specific lease, that you might have done, that was the driver of those numbers? Michael E. LaBelle: Yes, it is clear mix. It's, a, we did longer deals. And so, clearly, with a longer lease you have a higher commission. And then there's a majority of deals that were weighted towards New York City. And the New York City Leasing Commission has given that the New York City rents are also higher, pushing the number significantly. Robert E. Pester: Several of those deals in New York City were 20-year leases. So they have a pretty significant impact. David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division : Given the fact there's increasing pricing power across most of your markets. When do you think we can start to expect to see some of those absolute numbers start to tick down? Michael E. LaBelle: I think that, net-net, we are not seeing a lot of pushback on concessions in any of the markets that we operate in. Because there is still a bid for either new construction or there are landlords who are prepared to provide additional concessions with a higher rent. So there's been less pressure on that. Interestingly, in San Francisco, most of the transactions, from a concession perspective, are not too dissimilar from where they were 2 or 3 years ago, but the rents are 25% higher. David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division : Okay. And then just one last question, I'm not sure who wants to answer this. But given the sort of reversal of the 10-year, RMG has moved up pretty substantially, indicative of a readthrough to further compression in cap rates. I guess, number one, are you seeing any evidence of that or is it too soon? And number two, are you underwriting even tighter cap rates in most of your markets for future transactions? Owen D. Thomas: Well, it's Owen. There was a transaction announced in Washington, D.C. this week, the PNC Plaza, and it was an all-time record of 1,000, I think 1,075 -- if Ray is on, he could confirm -- 1,075 a square foot. So that is some tangible evidence, to us, that we have this volatile period and the market is continuing to move forward. And anecdotally, given that we're in the marketplace, we hear about other deals that are continuing to progress at pretty aggressive numbers. So I don't think it -- David, I don't think it necessarily changes our underwriting. But as I said in my remarks, on the acquisitions side, we're focused on deals where we have some kind of unique angle to Boston Properties. Whether it be using our partnership units or something that's got a value-added component. I guess, the good news is that maybe we sold the portfolio to Norges too cheap, but we retain 55% of it, so it should come through on our NAV right? Operator : Your next question comes from Brendan Maiorana with Wells Fargo. Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : I wanted a follow up just a little bit on San Francisco. I think it was mentioned in prepared remarks that VC funding was very high this year, higher first three quarters than it had been the past few years. And then I think you also mentioned that part of the improved leasing activity was the companies that are expanding their hiring expectations. Are you guys seeing any change in terms of tenants taking down growth space, such that the leasing that's occurring there now, has got a little bit more shadow space or growth space baked into it than what we've seen so far this cycle? Michael E. LaBelle: So let me answer the question in the following manner. Traditionally, in San Francisco, post the dotcom meltdown, technology companies had the luxury of being able to basically do just-in-time demand for their real estate offerings. So if they needed 50,000 square feet of space, they wait until 6 months before they needed it. They hire the people and the they would lease -- the space would be plentiful and it would be there. And I would say that was the situation that you were seeing in San Francisco until about 2 years ago. And 2 years ago, everyone sort of woke up at the same time and said, there are not a lot of blocks of suites available. And so technology companies, the Salesforces of the world, the Dropboxes of the world, the Ubers of the world, the LinkedIns of the world, the Googles of the world, all said, if we're going to be able to continue to grow, we have to be become more corporate and long ranging in our views on how we go about acquiring sites and making sure that we have the real estate facilities necessary to allow our growth and our new employees and existing employees to move into, as we sort of get there. So I would tell you that there is absolutely no question that a lot of what is going on today are tenants that are taking down space in expectation of growing their organizations. But these are all organizations, and Mike has, ad nauseam, talked about this in the past, that have tremendous operating fundamentals that have clear profitability indicators in either EBITDA or cash flow growth or top line revenue growth. And so you can see the logic behind their need for additional employees, juxtaposing it to, back in 2000, 1999, when there were a tremendous number of non-publicly traded or publicly traded and recently funded organizations that were based upon a business plan without any revenues, without any income, without any sort of track record. And it all sort of suddenly fell into the ocean in 2001. It's a really different kind of a class of customers that are doing what I'm describing. And I think that's what changing. But it is absolutely true that they are looking at real estate a couple of years before they need it because they don't have a choice, at this point, other than to do that. David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division : Okay, that's very helpful. Just one other just kind of follow-up question. Mike LaBelle, just on a very high level basis, it sort of seems like 2015, as you've highlighted, is a transition year from a same-store growth perspective. Is it kind of similar to, I think, what was 2012 or that appeared like it was a bit of a transition year. And then you posted very strong growth last year and this year on a same-store basis. Is that sort of how we should think about the years, maybe the couple of years after '15, that you're kind of priming the pump pretty good same-store growth thereafter? Michael E. LaBelle: I will agree with you that I think there's a good opportunity for us to have faster same-store growth beyond 2015, assuming that we are successful in leasing up the space that we have in Boston, which again is at The Pru Tower and the Hancock Tower and The Pru shops, which we're going to see strong growth on. And then if you look at San Francisco, and you look at 250,000 square feet EC expiring to the end of '15. But the 900,000 square feet expiring during 2016 at rates of under $50 a square foot, we should be able to lease that space today in the mid-60s to 70. So again, to the extent that we're successful in being able to kind of renew those and lease-up any space we get back, which I think we should be, we should see some benefit from both of those. So I do think that we are well-positioned heading into 2016 given that dynamic. Operator : Your next question comes from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : I just wanted to follow-up on the likelihood of potential 1031 Exchange and maybe if you could dovetail into that some of the opportunities you are seeing on the investment front and whether or not it's possible to potentially 1031 into development? Michael E. LaBelle: Okay. Let's see, I'll let Owen describe sort of the pipeline of things that we're looking at. Conceptually, it is virtually impossible to 1031 into development in a meaningful way because the dollars to be put out the door within 6 months. And the fact of the matter is you have to do it on a property by property basis and there's just not enough capital on a current basis going out in any of these assets to make a meaningful dent on that. Owen D. Thomas: And then on the new investment opportunities, I would put them in a couple of different categories. Although I think probably the most significant category is looking at new developments, so particularly new sites. So if you look at markets, particularly I would say in San Francisco and in New York City, we have a number of projects that we're actively working on, where we would acquire a new site and it would be a new development. We do look at the acquisition of existing assets in all of our markets. We're very active in that. But as we've talked about, from a pricing perspective, we've had a very difficult time making the figures work for those kinds of acquisition. So, again, going back. I think the focus for us to be competitive in this market is, is there a development or redevelopment angle, where we can our development and operating expertise to create value or is it something where there is a tax protection we can provide through our unit. That would be another category of things that we'd be looking at. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Okay. And just following up on on-development, as a look at San Francisco and there have been a number of questions surrounding sort of the strength and how long it will continue. What's sort of the appetite to invest incrementally in new development there given the existing exposure to Salesforce Tower et all? Douglas T. Linde: I think it's a very fair question, Jordan, and that the good news is that, from a timing perspective, none of the things that we are currently looking at are \"likely this sort of cycle development,\" in other words they're not going to be started in the next 6 months and be competing with the completion of Salesforce Tower, which is going to occur in the first quarter of 2017, knock on wood. So that most of them are -- as everyone knows, there's been a lot of talk about Prop M and the inability for the city, at the moment, to approve new development much more than what has currently been discussed, which is another a couple of million square feet, which is already sort of \"spoken for\". Most of that the stuff, the things that we're looking at, are projects that will be a 3- to 4-year permitting exercise. Working with the city, getting in line, doing what's necessary to procure the rights and get our Prop M allocation, and then be in a position to start the development at that point. So net-net, given our current exposure, I think I would hope and expect that our current exposure will have been long put to bed prior to the commencement of these other developments. So maybe we will get involved in something else in the interim. That's sort of in the process because it make sense for us from a capital perspective and there's an opportunity that we see. But most of the things that we're working on really have a more longer timeframe associated with it, which really will not be competitive with the Salesforce Tower. Owen D. Thomas: And just one thing I would add to what Doug said. If you think about our portfolio -- and we talked about this a lot, the investor conference, in Boston, and to some extent Washington, particularly in Reston, we have somewhat of an embedded long-term development pipeline. Because we have sites on our existing assets. We have the North Station project, which you're going to be hearing more and more about. Whereas in New York and San Francisco, we don't. And so that deals that Doug is describing is really setting is up for continued longer-term development investment in those 2 markets. Mortimer B. Zuckerman: This is Mort. Let me make a comment about the Salesforce Tower, because that building is being leased, 50% of it's being leased, but it's the bottom 50%. The upper 50% is unique in San Francisco. There's just going to be nothing like it. So I think it's just going to have an unusually strong competitive position, no matter what other buildings come on stream in the San Francisco market. We're talking about the tallest building, by far, in San Francisco. And we're looking at the top 40 floors, give or take a little bit. And those floors are going to have unparalleled views and will have an identity that will be just remarkable. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : Two questions for me. The first question is -- if you could just comment on the dialogue with tenants, especially the bigger tenants -- are you seeing the tenants engage proactively in lease negotiations earlier, trying to get a jump on playing off the, whether its development or availability of space or are you seeing landlords being ever more proactive, reaching out for tenants sooner, to try and ensure that tenants don't even get a whiff of what else may be out there? Michael E. LaBelle: So obviously, it depends upon the size of the tenant. I would tell you that -- and I'll let John Powers chime in here, I would tell you that almost every major tenant, and if you define a major tenant as more than a couple of hundred thousand square feet, is very sophisticated about what's going on in the market place as are we. And so it is a natural conversation for an organization to be having with it's landlord or for it's landlord to be engaging with its customer about what its long-term opportunities might be, how it might be able to reuse and reutilize its space more efficiently and what the choices might be in its existing portfolio versus going outside the portfolio and looking at -- either subsidize new development, which is what the issue is and in the case of a place like New York City, with the Hudson Yards and the step down in the World Trade Center area or new just sites that has been permitted and where building potentially available in a market like Washington D.C. But John, do you want to comment on that? John Francis Powers : Well, I think you're 100% right. But I add on to that, depends upon the situation of the tenant and their business. Are they long space, like Weil was? Are they short space? Do they need additional space today? Is their business -- need to be reconfigured? So we can do have a look at the macro conditions in the market that Doug spoke about. But every tenant has its own deal and its own story and its own structure, specially if they're more than 150,000 feet. Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And then the second question is for Mike LaBelle. As you guys contemplate -- right now, you spoke of not needing to recycle any capital. You guys are sufficiently funded. But when you, presumably, get around to the next round of potential asset sales or JVs, as far as JVs goes, how much of an impact is it with regards to the rating agencies, as to which assets you choose versus you've ample capacity regardless, within the rating covenants, that you can be looking at unencumbered assets to JV just as easily as encumbered assets to JV? Michael E. LaBelle: We have plenty of room and we had specific conversations with the rating agencies around the Norges joint venture because a couple of these assets are unencumbered. And our expectations, in the near term, is they will remain unencumbered. We do, however, have rights to encumber these assets, up to certain levels that are fully within our rights, and our partner is fine with that. So, to the extent that there was a situation where we wanted to encumber them to improve our pool, we could do that. However, in our conversations with the rating agencies, there's not a lot of concern from them related to that issue. There are many other companies that also have JVs like this, that have strong ratings. And my view is that it has minimal, if any, impact on where our rating is today. Operator : And your final question comes from Vance Edelson with Morgan Stanley. Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Maybe, first, just an update on traditional versus nontraditional tenants in Manhattan. In recent quarters you've referred to the traditional tenants in Midtown, and downtown D.C. for that matter, being weaker as the economy continued to slowly improve. Do you feeling any sort of strength emerging or is it's still largely limited to tech and the less traditional verticals? Owen D. Thomas: John, do you want to cover that? John Francis Powers : Well, tech is strong in New York. It has been -- clearly that's the case, but that's a small percentage of the market. The high-end financials are doing well and I think the law firms are rightsizing. In our portfolio we've talked about looking with -- I've mentioned we're dealing with 7 law firms, Weil was -- it took less space, but some of them are expanding. So I think that the traditional sector is doing well. Tech Is doing very well. And I think there's a lot of interest, now, in moving to the future. People are looking at solving their business needs and getting their business situation correct, looking longer term. I think that's a lot of interest in Hudson Yards and also Brookfield's project. A big tenant looking at that. So I think the New York market is in more in a growth mode overall. But certainly, tech is the hottest. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And then on 535 Mission, it's coming on in about 1 year. Could you provide a progress update on the pre-leasing strategy? It doesn't look like anyone signed on during the quarter. So how are you balancing the desire to quickly fill the building versus holding out for potentially stronger rents down the road? Owen D. Thomas: So 535 Mission actually got it's TCO a week ago. And the first tenant will be in occupancy, and working in the space, within the next couple of weeks. We have signed our second lease at the top of the building this quarter -- I mean, in the fourth quarter in October. And we are close to execution on another lease that will bring us to about 65% committed and leased. And we expect the remaining portion of the building to be leased before the end of calendar year 2015, with rent commencement either in '15 or by no later than the middle of 2016. And we are we have seen about a 15% increase in rents from the first transaction that we did, which was probably negotiated 8 months ago, to the rents that we are asking today. Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Great. And last question. I appreciate that you can't forecast 2015 asset sales right now because there are some unknowns. But if, for example, market liquidity remains similar to today's environment and given that you don't need capital, would you be encouraged to sell core assets just based on market pricing versus the fundamental outlook? I'm trying to get a feel for just how attractive the pricing is right now in your mind. Michael E. LaBelle: Well, Vance, as I mentioned, we have non-core assets that we're going to continue to sell, subject to the pricing that we're able to receive for those assets. And then on the second category, which is more return-oriented, we're going to have to weigh those factors as we get in 2015. What's the pricing for the asset? What are the assets? What's the structure? What our capital needs? And it'll be a confluence of all those factors. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to management for any additional remarks. Owen D. Thomas: Okay. Let me just conclude by reminding everyone that we had a strong quarter financially, and hopefully we've been able to demonstrate that we continue to make terrific progress executing our plan. And thank you for all your attention and we'll see you all in 2 days. That's right, down at Atlanta, yes. Operator : This concludes today's Boston Properties conference call. Thank you, again, for attending, and have a good day.",

During the question-and-answer portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, our Executive Vice President of Acquisitions and Development, and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Mort Zuckerman for his remarks. Mortimer Zuckerman : Good morning, everybody. This is Mort Zuckerman. Let me spend a little bit of time talking about the economy \u2013 since we all work within that environment. The mood out there is really quite despondent. In the recent poll only 40% of Americans say they are satisfied with the economy, this erosion of support is because we are undergoing the weakest recovery from our recession since World War 2 and they have restored the benefits of a rebounding economy have not reached a significant percentage of Americans. In manufacturing we have 300,000 fewer jobs compared to when Obama took office and 1.5 million fewer total jobs than before the recession. Adjusted for inflation the average wage for an employee in America has increased by a mere 2% since Obama took office and half of that is because of increased hourly pay and the other half is because of increased hours. Ordinary folks are just not sharing the little wealth that has been created. Fortunately lower gas prices have put about $7.5 a week into the average wallet, but the President has lost much of his credibility interaction with the public and so is the Congress. The President is trying to shift all the next tax burdens as a tax on capital or wealth rather than on income or wages and the Republicans want to find ways to help the middle class primarily through a much stronger job market which they don\u2019t believe will come out of the Obama approach. But it\u2019s that kind of environment that is still the background for what we are all working in. A year ago 65% said the gap between the rich and everyone else had grown over the last ten years and 90% of Democrats and 45% of Republicans want to do something about this gap. So it\u2019s going to be a very interesting political year with the Republicans in charge of the Congress and the President of course as the Chief Executive on the other side of just about every issue. Fortunately for Boston Properties and its activities and strategy, we have been able to do and continue to do quite well given the fact that we are focused in certain markets and in certain developments within those markets, so I will say to you that we still believe there is a market for what we do. And I think we will be able to describe this as you hear from my colleagues in a little while. I have a little bit of an additional announcement. As you all know at the end of 2014 I completed my previously announced move from Executive Chairman to Chairman of the Board of Directors of Boston Properties. I will still be active in the company and I will obviously continue to share my views on the economy, on the markets and the company\u2019s activities with our Executive team and Board of Directors. By way of background, I\u2019m just going to say this. I found that Boston Properties nearly 45 years ago my long time partner and great friend the late and very talented Ed Linde, he joined me six months later. We shared a simple philosophy of building and buying first class buildings in first class locations, and first class markets. That may sound simple but it was a lot more difficult to execute. It was made possible primarily because of the wonderful group of people who joined the company over the years and helped grow Boston Properties. And to one to the largest and I sincerely believe one of the most respected real estate times in the country which remains true to this day. I believe it will continue given an outstanding management team who will continue to ensure that Boston Properties thrives and prospers. I look forward to remaining active as a Chairman of the board and continuing to provide my support to the company\u2019s efforts. I want to thank you all for supporting the company for the years that I have been involved and I wish everybody well. With that I will just turn the telephone over to my colleagues. Owen Thomas : Okay. Good morning, everyone, it\u2019s Owen Thomas. Thank you very much Mort. You and Ed Linde certainly built a remarkable franchise over the last 45 years and all of us have walked in properties are very grateful for all your successes on the company\u2019s behalf and we look forward to continuing our work together with you as Chairman of the Board. This morning I want to address the economic and operating environment, our performance for the fourth quarter and provide an update on our capital strategy and related accomplishments. Let me start with the environment, Mort touched on some of this. We\u2019ve all experienced rather significant and at least in my opinion unexpected volatility in a number of capital and commodity markets over the last quarter. As we all know oil prices have dropped to $45 a barrel -- basically dropped in half in just the last three months. European economies continue to suffer declining economic growth and inflation prompting strong action by the European Central Bank which initiated a new and aggressive QE program. Many other Central Banks around the world have and will continue to take comparable actions. China announced 7.4% GDP growth for 2014 its lowest level since 1990. Lower interest rates and slower growth outside the U.S have prompted a roughly a 15% rise in the trade weighted dollar over the last six months, and importantly lower interest rates around the world have sparked a reduction in our rates here in the U.S. The 10-year has dropped another 40 to 50 basis points in the last quarter to a level of around 1.8% today. U.S economic growth has remained reasonably robust; the forecast for this year or for 2014 is around 2.5%. You just saw our fourth quarter announcement of 2.6% and the unemployment rate which more discussed has dropped under 6, though under employment remains definitely high. So, what does all this mean for Boston Properties? Starting with the property markets. In the short term there has not been nor do we expect much change. We\u2019re not active in any energy driven markets, so we see no direct impact to our tenants from falling oil prices and their associated negative impact on capital investment and employment in the energy sector. We continue to see healthy economic growth in San Francisco, Boston and New York driven by technology and other creative tenancy, while downtown Washington, D.C are driven more by government and law firms continues to experience more difficult leasing conditions. The longer term impacts of all the recent market moves are more difficult to discern. Lower energy prices should be healthy for consumers, however low oil prices will have a negative impact on energy sector and a stronger dollar will be an obvious headwind for exporters and the U.S. companies with significant non-U.S. activities as evidenced by some earnings reports over the last week. Now moving to the impacts on the capital market for real estate. Lower interest rate can only add to the aggressive pricing we witnessed for assets in our core markets. Further the downward pressure on growth and interest rates outside the U.S. has likely pushed back the timing for the inevitable increases in U.S. rates. Acquisitions will likely remain as competitive as ever and we believe we can be more patient in the pace of our asset sales and in company financing activity. Now let me move to results for the fourth quarter. We continue to perform well and made excellent progress in the execution of our business. FFO for the fourth quarter was $1.26 a share which is a $0.01 above consensus forecast. We completed 88 leases in the fourth quarter representing 2.2 million square feet with the New York region being the largest contributor at nearly half the leasing volume. This level of leasing activity is roughly 70% higher than our quarterly averages. And for all of 2014 we executed 362 leases representing 7.8 million square feet of activity an annual leasing record for Boston properties. The record level of leasing is being driven by not only new development activity but also the early renewals of several significant law from tenants, primarily in New York but also in Washington, D.C. Our in-service properties in the aggregate are 91.7% leased down 0.3% from the end of the third quarter. Now moving to capital strategy, as mentioned our approach will remain consistent with what we have communicated in prior quarters. Given that prime assets in our core markets are trading at higher prices per square foot and lower yields than where we can develop, we will likely continue to be net sellers of real estate while reinvesting raised capital into new development. Starting with acquisitions, the pursuit of acquisitions remains active but challenging. New investments considered have some type of competitive angle for us, such as providing tax protection through the use of operating partnership units is consideration; working with a financial partner on specific assets or involving properties with a development or redevelopment component where we add value to our expertise. We also continue to be active in our disposition activity. In the fourth quarter we completed the sale of Patriots Park, the Norges Venture on 601 Lexington Avenue Atlantic Wharf office and 100th Federal Street and the sale of a small land parcel [ph]. With these three transactions along with the sale of five additional smaller assets we sold $2.3 billion in 2014 at 4.25% aggregate cap rate resulting in a $4.50 special dividend to shareholders and the remaining capital to be invested in developments we expect to yield around 7%. Turning to dispositions for 2015 we intend to remain active. We will continue to focus on non-core assets and transactions where pricing is very attractive relative to the cash flow growth characteristics of the assets. Our expectation is that we will likely have a greater number of smaller transactions in 2015 totally in excess of $750 million in total dispositions. In early January we restored the contract for the sale of our lease hold interest in the Avenue at a net price of $190 million. The Avenue is a 335 unit Class A apartment building with 50,000 square feet of associated retail located adjacent to George Washington University at Washington Circle and is encumbered by 54 year remaining ground lease. The sale was completed at a 4.1% cap rate; our basis in the asset is $95 million and the total unleveraged return to shareholders from this development is 15.2%. The transaction is scheduled to close in the first quarter and is another great example of the value we add for shareholders through our development activity. We continue to emphasize development for our new investment activities given the opportunity we see to recycle capital from the sale of our older buildings into new projects with higher returns. We did not fully place in service any new assets in the fourth quarter and did add the previously discussed 15,000 square foot expansion of the Prudential Retail Center to our active pipeline which now consists of 11 projects representing 3.3 million square feet with a total projected cost of $2.1 billion. Our development pipeline is in the aggregate 58% preleased. However, we had a number of important accomplishments in our pre development pipeline which Doug will cover in more detail in his remarks. Most importantly we completed our joint venture agreement with Delaware North for the development of the 1.8 million square foot mixed-use North Station project located adjacent to the Boston Garden. Further we were able to add two potential projects to our pre development pipeline aside at 4th & Harrison Street in San Francisco and a renovation of potential development at the Back Bay Transit Station in Boston. We are now actively engaged with development projects at two of Boston's three major transportation nodes. We continue to be in the pre-development stage on a significant set of projects with strong potential in all our markets. Over the next year, we expect to be able to add approximately $1 billion in new projects to our active development pipeline, which is followed by a significant number of additional projects for future years all of course, subject to market conditions. Let me turn the discussion over to Doug for a further review. Douglas Linde : Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. Talking to you here from snowy Boston, where we've recovered from the blizzard of January 2015. We were \u2013 in fact, were closed on Tuesday, so we couldn't physically get here, there was a state of emergency. All the roads were closed. So we were unable to get our work out to you as we'd hoped. But we got it to you last night and here we are this morning. I'm going to organize my comments into three segments today. The current state of our operating markets, I'm going to give you a short update on our existing development pipeline. And then I'm going give \u2013 put a little bit more meat on the bones of our future development activities. Consistent with Owen's remarks on the overall US economy as we enter 2015, the overall health of the office markets, in our opinion is stronger today than it was 12 months ago. And why do I \u2013 why do we say this. Well, first and foremost, it's the demand from the technology and the life sciences businesses that's really driving things, and it continues to be very strong. In 2014, there was more capital deployed in the start-up ecosystem than in any year since 2000. Venture capital investing in 2014 was over $48 billion and included more first and second round investment than at any time since 2001. The Silicon Valley and New York City and Boston dominate the share of those investments. In 2014, the top 20 technology leases in San Francisco totaled almost 3.8 million square feet of demand. The average of the previous four years, which all were strong years, was 1.9 million square feet. In Massachusetts, we had 17 biotech IPOs in 2014 compared to 9 in 2013. And while the demand from traditional office tenants in the legal and the large financial services sector is not expanding, we believe we're getting much closer to the end of the law firm and financial services space reductions, stemming from changes to space utilization and downsizing. And we're seeing small financial firms expanding and absorbing high quality, premium office space. One of the DC brokerage firms actually estimates that 80% of the law firms in the DC market have gone through their downsizing cycles. So we're getting closer to the end. We had a terrific year on the leasing front, judged by our gross volume of activity. And that was driven in large part by the Salesforce.com lease at Salesforce Tower, and our strategic decision to go get in front of our major law firm expirations. So in 2014 we completed six leases with law firms, with expirations from 2015 to 2022, totaling over 1.4 million square feet. As you can see from our leasing statistics in the supplemental, the mark-to-market we've been describing in Boston was 38%, and in San Francisco 22% positive, all running through the portfolio as we've talked. The Boston figures are dominated by 139,000 square feet of leases in our Cambridge portfolio, where there was a net increase of over 50%. The New York City portfolio had a very small down hit this quarter, largely due to the fact that the majority of the deals were coming from Princeton, where there were limited transaction costs. And there was only one Manhattan deal in the stats and it was actually a short term extension on a piece of space that was signed in 2010. So, really very irrelevant. And in DC, those supplemental statistics are really biased by the NII bankruptcy, which resulted in a leased piece of space that was sublet, converting to a direct lease with Leidos in Reston Town Center, and that resulted in a $5 a square foot reduction in rent on 72,000 square feet. If you pull that out, our transactions in DC were actually up 12% on a net basis. Last quarter, I provided a leasing roadmap for our 2015 earnings projections. This morning my focus is really on the current market conditions that are impacting our portfolio. So let's start in Washington, DC. The Washington, DC, CBD market continues to be very competitive, since there really hasn't been any significant increase in demand. In the face of this, our DC team is making significant progress on the future explorations which are found in our 50% owned JV properties in the CBD. In December, we completed 250,000 square foot early renewal at 901 New York Avenue where this law firm downside by only 15%. In three assets, where we have upcoming rollover due to law firm relocations, we are competing for and wining market share. At 901 New York Avenue we\u2019ve 90,000 square foot lease expiration in 2015 and we have leases signed or pending for 55,000 square feet of that space. At Market Square North, where we\u2019re getting 90,000 square feet back, we have leases pending on 60,000 square feet. And at Metropolitan Square at the end of the year we have a 122,000 square feet lease expiring at the top of the building and the space is probably some of the best space in the entire portfolio and then in the entire city. It does continue to be a [indiscernible] supply coming into the DC market in the form of partially let buildings for lead tenants, not unlike the building we\u2019re building at 601 Mass, as well as speculative new construction in the CBD NOMA in the Southwest market. Reston, which offers walkable retail and a great mix of offers in multifamily continues to drive tenants. Small tenant demand is strong. And Bechtel which move to Reston Overlook in July of 2012 continues to relocate additional employees into the Town Center and we are working hard to find space to accommodate their growth. As we described last quarter and NII filed for bankruptcy, and it resulted in about 72,000 square feet space moving to direct lease with Leidos, a 21,000 square foot expansion by Google to take some of that space, and about 63,000 square feet of immediately available uncovered exposure. The Omnibus Federal Spending Legislation that was signed in December may result in some limited spending increases in the defense and homeland security areas. And if this finds its way into the program associated with Fort Meade such as the Cyber Command, it should improve our opportunity to see enhanced leasing activity at our JV asset up at Annapolis Junction. Four of those law firm transactions I talked about were completed in New York City in the portfolio in 2014. And as I said earlier this was a strategic decision since these tenants were all evaluating the large blocks of space available both Downtown on the Far West side and those blocks that were going to become available due to the some of the tenant relocation such as Conde Nast and Time down from the Midtown West market to the Downtown market. The economics we achieved in these transactions recognized the locations of our buildings in contracts to the potential competition, in other words, we got paid for the kind of sales we had. We didn\u2019t compete on price. In the case of Weil, we were also able to take a floor back on December and have already listed in an average mark-to-market of over 60%. We also completed an early renewal at the top of the building with the mark-to-market on the initial rent is over 25%, so to give you a sense of the embedded upside at the General Motors building. We\u2019re actively working to release a 173,000 square feet of our Citi [ph] exposure at 601 Lex that occurs in mid 2016, 90,000 square feet of that is on floor 15, 16 and 17, and we\u2019re under discussion and working with Citi on an early termination and a lease-back. The rest of the space is in the Annex building, the low-rise where we expect to commence a major redevelopment in 2016. Activities are high in the New York City, rents over a $100 a square foot was almost 1.9 million square feet, which was more than double the activity in 2013, and its risen from the nadir in 2009 of under 200,000 square feet. We have leased our last available floor at 510 Madison Avenue. While the majority of the high end activity is still under 40,000 square foot on a unit basis and the new leases averaged about 12,000 square feet as oppose to the renewals. Larger transactions above $90 a square foot are becoming more and more frequent on Park Avenue and in the Plaza District. Princeton continues to outperform the New Jersey markets. We completed almost the 100,000 square feet of leases in the fourth quarter most expanding pharma companies, and we\u2019re now in lease negotiations with another 250,000 square feet as we enter 2015. Turning to Boston, the Kendall Square area of Cambridge continues dramatically outperform the rest of the Urban Boston market and asking rents above $70 a square foot. Our prevalent and vacancy rate is under 8%. Migration out of Cambridge is now occurring. During the last half of 2014 three tenants move to space in the Financial District. The Back Bay and Downtown crossing, because they couldn\u2019t find the space at an affordable price. In the Back Bay we are underway with our repositioning and re-branding at a 120 Clarendon, the Hancock Tower low-rise, where we have 150,000 square feet availability. Our asking rents on the low-rise space of the Hancock Tower are lower than the rents in Cambridge. When fully leased the available space of the Hancock should generate close to a 40% increase over expiring rents. The Waltham Metro West market continues to get stronger driven by expansion by life science and technology companies. Organic growth continues into 2015, a number of suburban life science and tech companies have announced its expansion. During the fourth quarter we completed another 175,000 square foot of leasing in the market including 61,000 square foot leased at Bay Colony. This was the space we toured during our Investor Conference in September bringing our total leasing at Bay Colony in 2014 to over 250,000 square feet. We have limited current vacancy in suburban portfolio, but we\u2019re taking back our 170 Tracer Lane, which is 75,000 square foot building, and taking it out of service and repositioning in the spring and we\u2019re going to be getting about 100,000 square feet back at Bay Colony in October. San Francisco continues to be the strongest demand in the country with expected Prop M restrictions is also going to be facing availability supply constraints. 2015 will be very similar 2014 with very limited rollover and flat occupancy in all existing portfolio. During the fourth quarter we completed eight more leases including a vacant leased floor at EC4 with starting rents in excess of $80 a square foot. What actively engage with over 250,000 square feet of full floor tenant with 2016 and 2017 lease expiration, some of these renewals will be with law firms where they are shedding some amount of space, but we see significant opportunities for rental rate increases for both the renewal and the recapture space. The average mark-to-market over this \u2013 on the starting rent on all these transactions is over 50%. Our current development pipeline continues to show strong leasing momentum. Wolverine took an additional 30,000 square feet at 10 City Point bringing the leasing in our project to 74%. We have three leases under negotiation at 888 Boylston Street, which would more than double our commitments to over 260,000 square feet. We\u2019ve completed two additional leases at 535 Mission bringing us to 202,000 square feet of sign leases or 66% lease at the end of the year and we have a number of active full floor proposals under discussion there. We leased all of the office space at 690 Folsom, which was delivered in early December. The Avant, the residential building in Reston is now 84% leased after 13 months. 601 Mass Ave in Washington DC signed it first retail lease for 12,000 square feet and we\u2019re in negotiations on the remaining 6,000 square feet of that retail. We anticipate delivering building to A&P, Arnold & Porter, per the lease during the third quarter of 2105. At 250 West 55th Street, we ended the year at 79% lease. We continue to have success with small tenants and continuing our prebuilt program on the 38th floor where we\u2019ve done two leases of 5600 square each in the high 90 starting rent. Another 13,000 square feet of prebuilt is under lease negotiation and there good full floor activity on a portion of the remaining floors. Construction at Saleforce Tower continue to progress with the mid 2017 delivery for space at the top of the building were not yet in the window for any lease expiration driven leasing under 100,000 square feet. Our marketing team continue to activity market the building across the bay area both urban and in the Silicon Valley and there is a continuous flow of users that have expect interest in the building and we have commence preliminary conversations with the few large tenants for the building for delivery in 2017. Before I turn the over to Mike, I do want to provide some commentary on our future development pipeline where we really didn\u2019t make a lot of significant progress during the fourth quarter. The press release announced the official commencement of our venture at North Station. We\u2019ve also garnered our first lease commitment for the retail podium. Star market has taken 62,000 square feet to put in a full service grocery store and we are in decisions with the number of other retailers, as well as office tenant for various portions of the podium structure. Design documents are progressing and over the next few months along with our partners at Delaware North, we will determine the phasing of the project and how and when we will sequence the construction. Again, earlier this month we completed an amendment with the state of Massachusetts for the Back Bay Garage leasehold. We agree to a 45-year extension of the ground lease, so it\u2019s now a 99 year ground lease. We agree to prepay the ground rent. We agree to manage the refurbishment of the Back Bay Train Station which will be paid for by this Commonwealth of Massachusetts. We agree to take over the property managing and leasing of the station. And most importantly, we created the mechanism to potential add additional density to our existing Clarendon Street Garage plus a separate parcel adjacent to the train station and the garage. We have not yet advanced any plans for these air-rights parcels nor have we had any detailed conversations with the City of Boston or the local community. This will come as we work furiously over the next year to advance our planning. In San Francisco, we\u2019ve executed an option agreement on a 2.3 acre site at 4th & Harrison and to assist the long term owners, the Barrett family with the permitting process on this block. The site is located in the heart of south of market area and it is two blocks from stops on the new central subway line on fourth streets that connect Caltrans to the city. Based on the pending Central SoMa zoning, approximately 780,000 of office retail and/or residential can be built on this site. We will however require Pro M allocation before we commence development. We are in advanced discussion on the development project in an outer borough Manhattan probably one of the worst-kept secrets in the city, as well as another site in Waltham, Massachusetts that would include building that could be under construction in 2015 and the potential for a million square feet of additional office and retails development, that\u2019s on a joint venture basis. We continue to chase a large GSA consolidation requirement for our Springfield, Virginia landholding and we are in design in permitting for 500 residential units and 25,000 square feet of retail development in the Reston Town Central urban core on our signature site. So as Owen suggested we may not be making much acquisition headway, but we continue to dramatically expand our opportunities to put our capitals to work through our development activities. And with that, I\u2019ll let Mike go through our results for 2014 and our 2015 guidance. Michael LaBelle : Great. Thanks, Dough. Appreciate it. Good morning, everybody. I\u2019m going to start with the couple of comments on our capital markets activity. As Owen mentioned, we have successful closing of sales of Patriot's Park and the portfolio of sale of 45% interest in Atlantic Wharf, 100 Federal Street and 601 Lexington Avenue this quarter. The returns associated with these deals reflect the strong value creation that we can achieve through the development process, as well as the smart and disciplined acquisition strategy. The unleveraged IRRs we generated with these investments were strong and total 10% for Patriot's Park, which is over 16 year whole period and 15.5% for the portfolio sale.  I do want to point that the $970 million gains on sale for the portfolio deal is reflected in our financial statement has an increase in our paid in capital account combined with the decrease in non-controlling interest and property partnerships to account for the debt assumed, and not as a simple gain on sale as you might expect. This accounting treatments stems from the fact that we have maintained operating control of the buildings and we will continue to consolidate them under GAAP. We were also active in the debt market this quarter. We refinanced our $150 million expiring mortgage loan on 901 New York Avenue. The old loan had an interest rate of 5.19% and the new 10-year mortgage loan which is for $225 million, it has a coupon of 3.61%. We locked the rate when 10-year treasury rates were in the 2% range and with rally in rate this we think we can price a new 10-year in the bond market today in the 3.8% to 3.25% area. This quarter we also regained $550 million of our unsecured notes that were set to expire in mid 2015. That resulted in a debt extinguishment charge to earnings of $10.6 million or $0.06 per share in the fourth quarter. This was relatively high cost debt with an average coupon of 5.34% and the redemption was funded with the portion of the net proceeds from our sales activity and was included in our prior guidance. Our projections don\u2019t include raising new debt capital in 2015, but given the low interest rate environment we are evaluating various hedging strategies including both traditional interest rate hedges and potentially early refinancing of a portion of our 2016 and 2017 debt maturities that have an average coupon of 5.8%. Our current cash on hand is nearly $2.3 billion after funding our special dividend of $4.15 per share this week and our forecasted development spend, we project the cash balance at year end 2015 of about $800 million. Turning to our earnings for the quarter, we reported funds from operation of $1.26 per share which is $0.02 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range. The earnings outperformance came from a combination of core portfolio performance and better than projected development and services fee income. The biggest mover in the portfolio was from the accelerated recognition of fair market rental revenue associated with Weil Gotshal, who elected to terminate the 35th of the GM building a couple of months earlier than we have projected. As Doug mentioned we\u2019ve already leased this floor to a new tenant at rent rollup of over 60% that we will have down time in 2015 as the spaces build out. A portion of our fee income this came from the signing of our joint venture agreement at North Station. This enables us to recognize development fees this quarter as well as through 2015 as we finalize the design and plans for the first phase of the project. We also generated better than projected service related fee income this quarter. Overall we had a really strong year in 2014. Our portfolio generated same-store cash NOI growth of 5.6% over 2013. As Owen mentioned we sold $2.3 billion of assets at a weighted average cap rate of 4.25% and we delivered $1.5 billion of new developments that are currently 86% leased and our anticipated to generate an initial cash yield which is weighted by 250 West 55th Street of over 6% on stabilization. In addition we have another $2.1 billion of development underway, with a projected initial cash yield of greater than 7%. And importantly, we\u2019ve already raised the funds required to complete our pipeline which is currently sitting in cash on our balance sheet. As we look at 2015 and as we discussed last quarter we have 580,000 square feet rollover in our CBD Boston portfolio primarily at the Hancock Tower that we anticipate will result in a temporary loss of occupancy and income during 2015. Again, up on releasing we anticipate a significant uptick in rent from the space, but it negatively impacts our 2015 earnings growth. The majority of this space expired on December 31, 2014. So we expect our occupancy to dip down from its yearend level of 91.7% to closer to 90% in the first quarter before recovering and averaging around 91% for the full year. In New York City were successful in our large law firm early renewal strategy in the quarter. We completed three law firm renewals totaling 700,000 square feet, the net space contraction was only 40,000 square feet or 5%. However, one the leases was above market and this in combination with the give-back space we\u2019ll have a negative impact on our 2015 cash NOI. On a GAAP basis these deals have a positive aggregate impact to our earnings due to contractual rental bumps in the leases. In Washington DC we are in contract to sell our residences on the Avenue project for a price of $190 million. We expect closing in early March and the loss of $5 million of FFO to 2015. The FFO cap rate which is 3.1% is lower than the cash cap rate that Owen described due to the impact of the ground lease that contained contractual increases that are straight lined for GAAP FFO. Our projections for the rest of the portfolio are generally in line with our guidance last quarter. Overall we anticipate our same-store GAAP NOI for 2015 to be relatively flat between negative 1% and positive 0.5% compared to 2014 and that\u2019s in line with our guidance last quarter. We project 2015 same-store cash NOI growth of flat to 1% from 2014, that\u2019s 50 basis points lower than last quarter due to the impact of the law firm renewal in New York. As Doug reviewed we saw good progress in our development leasing this quarter. Our developments are projected to add an incremental $53 million to $63 million of NOI in 2015. Our non-cash straight line and fair value lease revenue is projected to be $90 million to $100 million in 2015 and we expect our hotel to generate $12 million to $14 million of NOI in 2015. For our development and management services fee income we\u2019re projecting $17 million to $22 million in 2015, this is slightly better than last quarter due to higher expected development fee income. There\u2019s one item I do want to point out in our fee income that our GAAP fee income excludes cash leasing commissions that we collect on our consolidated joint ventures that in accordance with GAAP accounting, are recognize as a reduction non-controlling interest and more importantly they are amortized over the term of the respective leases which could be 10 to 20 years. If these joint ventures were unconsolidated we would earn the fees in the period the lease was signed. This quarter we collected $7.8 million of these fees, which is reflected in our FAB. We project our G&A expense to be $96 million to $100 million in 2015 which is lower than our projection last quarter. As I mentioned we have no material 2015 debt expirations and our guidance does not assume any additional financing activity during the year. Our net interest expense projections are unchanged from last quarter at $415 million to $425 million for the full year and includes $40 million to $50 million of capitalized interest associated with our development activities. Our non-controlling interest in property partnerships will be higher than in 2014 due to the sale of a 45% in the three asset portfolio to Norges. Because these properties remained consolidated, a 100% of the NOI and interest expenses reported in our consolidated statements and the net income allocated to the non-controlling interest is deducted separately. We have provided a page in our supplemental financial report that reconciles our non-controlling interest so that you can calculate the deduction from FFO. For the full year 2015, we project the FFO deduction for non-controlling interest and property partnership to be $135 million to $145 million. So if you combine all of our assumptions it results in our projected 2015 guidance range for funds from operations to be $5.28 per share to $5.43 per share. Despite the loss of $0.03 per share from the sale of the avenue, we are increasing our guidance range by $0.03 per share at the midpoint. Our guidance increase includes $0.02 per share of projected improvement and the contribution of our developments $0.02 per share from lower G&A and $0.01 of higher development fee income. We have not included any additional asset sales in our guidance. In the first quarter of 2015, we project funds from operations of $1.22 or $1.24 per share. As in the past our first quarter is always our weakest quarter due to the seasonality of our hotel and the timing of the accrual for payroll taxes investing in our G&A. With the addition of the residences on the avenue through our disposition program the aggregate impact from our disposition activity since 2014 is the loss of $72 million of FFO or $0.42 per share in 2015 compared to 2014. In addition, we paid $770 million or $4.50 per share special dividend to our shareholders. Despite this sales dilution we still expect to grow our FFO in 2015 with the strong contribution provided from delivering developments and lower interest expense from reducing our debt which in aggregate add over $90 million of incremental FFO to 2015 at the midpoint of our guidance range. In addition we have retained nearly $1.2 billion of sales proceeds for redeployment in our active development pipeline. That completes our formal remarks; I\u2019d appreciate if the operator would open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Michael Bilerman with Citi. Michael Bilerman : It\u2019s Michael. If we look at the residences at The Avenue sale, you had a comment about NOI support in your press release. Just wondering if you could share some details of what that entails with us Owen Thomas : Sure. So the weighted transaction restructured was exactly $196 million purchase price and to the extent that NOI is less than a particular number over the first I think six years of the property performance we effectively have agreed to make up the difference to the tune of a total of and a maximum amount of $6 million. So effectively for purposes of accounting we are only going to book $190 million sale and we have a $6 million receivable effectively there that will if we actually paid out then it will nothing will change if we don\u2019t pay it out last $6 million of additional gain later over the period. Michael Bilerman : That's helpful. And then maybe just more generally, was wondering if you've seen any changes in the investment landscape across your sort of prime CBD market, especially from foreign buyers? And maybe as a secondary, that if the drop in crude oil prices has led to any more recent changes in that environment? Owen Thomas : Michael, it\u2019s Owen, I\u2019d say no. I think that I can\u2019t point to a large number of significant trades there, but my expectation is that lower interest rate could make cap rates even more aggressive in our markets. And given that a number of sub and wealth funds are driven by oil revenues that is a very logical question you ask but I haven\u2019t seen any tempering of enthusiasm from there, because of lower oil prices. So we expect that he interest in our core markets by offshore investors will continue into 2015. Michael Bilerman : Great, thanks guys. Operator : And our next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch Jamie Feldman : Good morning. I'm hoping you can talk a little bit more about your comments on New York City. I think you had said you are seeing a pickup in 99,000 square feet and larger leasing activity on Park Avenue. Financial Services firms, boutiques getting a little stronger there. So I guess just kind of big picture as we are thinking about the year ahead, how is Park Avenue stacking up versus some of the other submarkets? And what are tenants -- what is kind of tenant desiring now for like some of the -- for either downtown or for the Hudson Yards versus some of these more traditional submarkets? Owen Thomas : John, do you want to take the first crack at that? John Francis Powers : Sure. Yes James, New York is in terrific shape now and on every measure if you look at tourists, if you look at employment; if you look at the number of people living in the city pretty much every variable is positive. As it reflects the leasing market I think the text are commission very well and you are seeing some expansion on the Midtown south into downtown and also into Midtown particularly the western part. And as Doug said, the financial market on the high end is doing very well also. So the availability rate has dropped about a point and were looking forward to drop all this year. Jamie Feldman : Okay. Any thoughts on prospects for rent growth in Midtown over the next year? John Francis Powers : Well I think that we are going to continue to see more upward pressure on rent than balance pressure. The availability rate however historically is still fairly high for rate what I would call event spike or event pop, although you have seen that certainly in some sections of the City and Midtown south certainly on the high end market we have a lot of activity at the over $90 and over $100 number that Doug mentioned that carrier has been cracked in a way it hasn\u2019t been since 2007. So I think that there is still going to be upward rent but perhaps not the rent spike until that availability rate drops down certainly to single digits. Jamie Feldman : Okay, and then just if you were to think about if the pendulum of demand, how maybe a year ago, Hudson Yards was very interesting to people, talking to brokers and some of the other companies, maybe that swung a little bit more towards traditional Midtown submarkets now, is that -- are you seeing that as well? Or it hasn't really changed? John Francis Powers : Well the Hudson Yards has been very attractive to the very large users that needed a block of space because finally you have got some space in Manhattan has been very difficult except of course downtown and most of the large, most of the deals done there have been through large organizations to set a land on very large blocks of space. The balance of Midtown has been very active and continues to be active. We\u2019re seeing very good activity at 250 now, 510 is pretty much done. When we get a floor of the GM that went quickly. So, with regard to the occupants of the vacancy we\u2019ve going to have at 399, we\u2019re pretty optimistic on that, that\u2019s the City space and the Morgan real space that were rolling it\u2019s like 17. We are already working on that and we are already seeing good activity. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then just a follow up for Michael LaBelle. Can you talk about the better G&A outlook what moved that? Michael LaBelle : So our G&A for 2014 was about $98 million, $99 million and there was still some costs in there from the transition of the CO that we had. So those costs are basically out of 2015. So 2015 now excludes those costs and has a kind of a general increase that we typically have for our competition. Jamie Feldman : Okay. All right\u2026. Michael LaBelle : So we basically did, we finalized all of our competition process over the last two weeks and we have put in what we actually have for raises and anticipated bonus accrual for 2015 in the numbers now. Jamie Feldman : Okay. All right, thank you. Michael LaBelle : I just want to make one more comment on New York City because I mean I did someone else that would put out a \u2013 what\u2019s going on with City. And I want to relate it to what we did, so the reality of the situation in New York is that for large tenant demand there are three primary choices. There\u2019s the renewal in place, there is the new construction on the far west side those have Hudson Yards or a Brookfield's project or there is the new construction and the huge availabilities downtown. The pricing opportunities on those two new constructions of areas are subsidized in some way shape or form how do you want to characterize it. And so, and recognizing that a large tenant with a 2017 to 2020 lease expiration in Manhattan have reason to look at those types of alternative, we made a decision that we were better off trying to cut those deals early at rents that we considered to be market rents for our space when we did that, which basically put our portfolio in the situation that we are now in which is the bulk of the availability that we have is in very small chunks of space in the higher portions of our buildings where we have the ability to achieve more premium rents than we might have had we allowed these various tenants to sign lease expirations that were going to bring them out of those buildings two or three or four years from now where we really didn\u2019t know when we were going to get the space back, what their market conditions might be. So, that those big blocks of space still remain the city and they have an impact on large tenant leasing, but they don\u2019t have that same impact on the single floor at a General Motors building or the single floor at a 510 Madison Avenue or a single floor at 399 or a single floor at 601. So we feel really good about how we have strategically positioned our portfolio in the context of what will likely happen in Midtown Manhattan and downtown Manhattan over the next three or four years. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And what do you consider the cut off when you say big buck? Owen Thomas : John, what your deal [ph] 250,000 square feet? John Francis Powers : Well, yes I would say 250 or more, most of the deals they have gone to the west side or gone downtown have been launched into that. I\u2019d say probably the average size is more like 500, but certainly a 250,000 foot user has few choices in Midtown. There are -- in addition to what Doug said, there are a couple of choices on 6th Avenue, one or two and that was another price point, clearly our renewals were done at a higher price point than that also. But those are essentially the choices that rush tenants out Downtown, Westside something on 6th or stay in place. Jamie Feldman : And is there a pipeline at all of new 250,000 square foot plus users like anywhere new to the market that\u2019s looking for that much space? John Francis Powers : Well there\u2019s always new users but when you just shove them further in the future. So the 19s are pretty much done now and people are looking that 20s and 21s research [ph] prices. So those tenants are starting to get in the market interviewing brokers. Jamie Feldman : Okay. All right. Thanks for the added color. Operator : And our next question comes from Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors. Jed Reagan : Good morning guys. How is the early law firm renewal process going so far versus your initial expectations, maybe if you were scoring yourself on your internal score card? And how much more of that program do you think you can complete in 2015? Owen Thomas : Can I jump in on the first one since we look at lot of these? We targeted and we\u2019ve done four out of five and we\u2019re still working on the last one. Douglas Linde : And in our other markets we had one on Boston which we completed and we have had three in Washington, D.C, one of them is done which I described one of them. We are in negotiation to complete and third one we made the decisions that rental desire to that kind we\u2019re not comparable with where we thought the space would be allowed to be let by other tenant and so we chose to move on. Owen Thomas : And that doesn\u2019t have an exploration of 2019 Doug. Jed Reagan : Okay. And the renewal in New York that had a role down was that unexpected roll down or did that come just you doesn\u2019t landed that sooner than you\u2019d initially thought? Owen Thomas : I\u2019ll give you the specifics there was tenant that did at least 10 years ago and their rent was $135 a square foot and that\u2019s above markets for they were in the building at 599 and we could resell them to at market rent. Jed Reagan : Okay. And then on the San Francisco option agreement, can you just talk about your expected timeline for moving through the permitting process on that? And if you were successful in permitting, do you feel like that's a project for this cycle potentially or are you more likely looking at a future cycle? Owen Thomas : I\u2019m going to let Bob answer the question if the site were permitted today it would be just cycle project, but I think that the matter is that it\u2019s not going to get permitted in short order. So Bob, you want to you sort of give a perspective on the permitting process. Robert Pester : Sure. This site falls within Central SoMa which is the master plan by the city right, that\u2019s not expected to actually be in place until sometime in 2016. They say first quarter probably be beyond that. So it definitely is going to be next cycle project based Prop M allocation and the Central SoMa quarter plan. Owen Thomas : But this site is in the heart of where all the activity is right now. I mean, if this site were available today, we probably would have significant demand for the larger tenants because of \u2013 proximity to the central subway line and the configuration of the site and the fact that we can do a really large floor plate. Jed Reagan : Boston Properties' move their local offices to that building? Owen Thomas : I don\u2019t think we have enough demand for the size of floors that this building would allow to have. So we\u2019re probably better off, a more traditional size floor plate. Jed Reagan : Thanks a lot guys. Operator : And our next question comes from Brad Burke with Goldman Sachs. Brad Burke : Thank you. Good morning, guys. Doug, I wanted to know what you\u2019re saying with construction cost and whether it\u2019s more pronounced in any of your markets than the others. And when you talk about building to over 7%, are you expecting much in the way of cost inflation? Douglas Linde : Okay. Let me answer the question in the following way. As much deflation as there is in the overall economy right now in terms of impacts of oil prices and the impact of other commodities, it\u2019s not being reflected in reductions in construction costs in our markets. And that\u2019s largely due to two things. The first is that the overall amount of activity in our markets on a relative basis is probably higher today that\u2019s it\u2019s been at any time over the past five or six years, so there is more institutional, residential, as well as commercial development going on in New York City, in Washington, D.C, in Boston and in San Francisco than there has been in quite some time. The other thing that has occurred is that during the downturn there were a number of contractors who basically gave up and either went out of business because they decided it wasn\u2019t profitable, or they were forced out of business, because they couldn\u2019t make ends meet. So there are number of quality contractors that are around to do the kind of work that we need to have done has been reduced. And so there has been somewhere in the neighborhood of 3.5% to 4.5% annualized increases in construction budgeting over the past year or so. And that is what we are using as we plan our projects on a going forward and that\u2019s all baked into our numbers. And we really don\u2019t expect to see much in the way of a change in that. In fact in some of the cities, some of the larger projects like the potential casino that\u2019s going to be built in Everett [ph] and the current casino that\u2019s being constructed at National Harbor are major users of both materials and labor and given that the revenue models of those types of projects are such that time is particularly important. They are prepared pay whatever takes to get resources and that impacts the overall availability from a construction perspective in those markets as well. So we\u2019re seeing it and we don\u2019t expect for it to abate further. Michael LaBelle : Just add to that Brad. On the projects that we have underway which is $2.1 billion that I indicated and Owen indicated had a return of over 7%. The vast majority of the cost associated with those prices have been bought, because those projects are underway. We have GMPs on contracts in place for those projects. So we\u2019re protected on those. The place where cost increases would have more of impact is the future stuff that Owen had mentioned and Doug had mentioned where we\u2019re building that into our budget based upon the timing of when we think those projects are going to happen. Brad Burke : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then\u2026 Michael LaBelle : Yes, just before and there is more [indiscernible] and Owen probably should talk about it, which is, I mean interest in our component and where people\u2019s returns expectations are also sort of a part of this whole process. Owen Thomas : Yes. Well, look I think that given lower interest rates and lower return generally available in the world, I think that\u2019s going to contribute to compression in the yields that investors are looking for in the development projects, and but that impacting land prices directly. Brad Burke : And with the 15 basis points decline that was same maybe more than that over the past couple of months. Are you seeing that yet and expectations and the pricing on assets or is it more anticipated? Michael LaBelle : I think we are seeing it. If you look at land price escalation that\u2019s occurred in San Francisco, I mean, some of it is clearly due to above inflation levels of rent increases that\u2019s driving some of it, but I think some of it definitely driving, is driven by returns. As we underwrite some of the sites that have been \u2013 that have sold they certainly are not being sold at least on our underwriting at 7% yield. Brad Burke : Okay. And then, Mike, as we are looking at the trajectory of FFO over the course of 2015, I think the full-year guidance is coming in line with what a lot of us were thinking about. The first quarter is lower, and I realize there are a lot of moving parts. But I was hoping you could help us think about FFO trajectory over the year, whether there's anything unusual in the first quarter beyond you had pointed out the normal seasonality with the hotel business and G&A? And I know you are expecting -- I think you had said $53 million to $63 million from those recently completed developments. But can you give us a sense of how much of that you are expecting in the first quarter? Michael LaBelle : So I would expect that our FFO would improve as the years goes on. As I mentioned in the core portfolio, we expect our occupancy to be at low point in the first quarter and will improve going forward. So I would expect to improve modestly throughout the year. And on the development side, you\u2019re also talking about in the first quarter a contribution of that $53 million to $63 million are being similar in the $12 million to $18 million. And incrementally growing every quarter as we continue to lease up some of the projects like 250 where we\u2019re doing leases on prebuilt that are coming in. The Avant every quarter we\u2019re seeing probably 20 additional units being leased by the end of the first quarter that should be fully stabilized. And then at 535 Mission, we\u2019re going to have lease up. And then in the fourth quarter, we\u2019ve 601 Mass coming on line. So obviously that has an impact on our interest expense, because the capitalize interest for that goes off. But out of the quarter it\u2019s going to paying on their 380,000 square foot lease starting in the fourth quarter. So you\u2019ll see that come into development site. Brad Burke : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Good morning. I guess two questions. One, I can appreciate the decline in interest rates is probably push-down return expectations for many sovereign wealth funds. I'm just wondering, has the strength of the dollar perhaps impacted just the actual demand that you are seeing? Or is it too early to maybe have an impact on the sales market? Owen Thomas : Steve, I think it\u2019s a good question and I would say, so far we haven\u2019t seen the impact, not to suggest if this continue that we won\u2019t see some impact. If anything I would say, the strengthening dollar has confirm that U.S. has an interesting areas of investment, because it\u2019s added to the return for the investments that have already been made here by offshore investors. But I don\u2019t see yet as an impact on capital flow. Michael LaBelle : And just the other component of the capital flow as well as that \u2013 and it shouldn\u2019t be discounted. It seems like the Canadians have continue to ramp up their interest in U.S. real estate. So we\u2019ve seen CPP and Oxford and now SPQU all make pretty significant investments in fourth quarter or commitments in the fourth quarter to purchase high quality, well located Manhattan Inn and other CBD market real estate. And so the flow of funds from either Asia or Europe or the Middle East or Canada or the domestic pension fund market which is also has found its desire to expand its allocate, and the real estate doesn\u2019t deal like it is flow down whether oil prices were $80 or $90 or $45 or $50 and when the Euro is was at $1.30 or $1.12. Owen Thomas : The other aspect too is okay, you\u2019re right, the dollars appreciated, but what\u2019s your expectation for what is going to do from here. Everywhere else around the world as we talked about our going down, yet there is certainly a lot of discussion in the U.S. about when rates are going to be increase. So the positive expectation for the future dollar appreciation is also affect, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s being looked at. Steve Sakwa : Okay. And I guess secondly, as it relates to development, I mean, I know that over the 40-plus years Mort's been building, you guys have generally had a relatively conservative stance towards development business. And Mort was able to navigate the waters in the kind of late 1980's, early 1990's. As we kind of move later into the cycle, are you guys thinking about development any differently? Or has the conservative stance you've always taken just something you could continue to do, or do you make any changes over the next couple of years? Owen Thomas : I would say Steve that our pension for having strong pre-leasing commitments prior to commencing construction has really been a pretty consistent fanatic way of approaching development. And while it is true that in San Francisco we started 300,000 square foot building on spec, aside from that there really hasn\u2019t been any other development of significance has been done without major pre-leasing effort. We continue to believe that we are pricing our development properties at a level that is a great in value for the tenants that are our customers. And we\u2019re feeling pretty good above where we are from a business cycle perspective in those markets where we\u2019re building new buildings and where those particular locations are. But we clearly \u2013 it\u2019s been now six or seven years since we obviously had a \u201crecessions\u201d at least from statistical perspective. So we\u2019re cognizant of what\u2019s going on across the market and we\u2019re also cognizant and as everyone here has described where our overall leasing efforts are on the developments that we\u2019ve commenced. And there is a strong focus on making sure that those things get leased before we put ourselves in a position where we\u2019re adding additional exposure to the portfolio. Michael LaBelle : And I would add to that Steve if you \u2013 it\u2019s certainly not going to always be the case and we do have landholdings in the company. But lot of what we\u2019ve been doing lately our joint ventures with landholders, the transaction that we did talked about in San Francisco involves an option to purchase lands, that we\u2019re also not employing at least in the some of deals, capital to purchase lands, at least upfront. Steve Sakwa : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Richard Anderson : Market in New York driven by the Princeton activity, what would say a normalized kind of mark-to-market would be when you look at your New York City, Manhattan portfolio today? Owen Thomas : And this is a first part of your question, but I think I\u2019ve answered this question in past quarters and I don\u2019t the answer is changed, which is it is highly dependent on the building. So as we look at the portfolio, the largest exposure we have from a positive mark-to-market is at 76 [ph] Fifth Avenue, the General Motors building, where we had and we talked about this when we purchased the building back in 2008 where we had close to a 1 million square feet of that, almost 2 million square foot building that was let it at rents in the mid to low 80s. And so, there\u2019s enormous mark-to-market that dwarves everything else. The deals that we\u2019ve been doing at 601 Lexington Avenue under margin have been a positive mark-to-market, not a significant one. As 599 has been a negative mark-to-market on the transaction we\u2019ve done recently with these law firms because most of those yields were done in that 2005, 2006 time frame when market had been exposed to a pretty significant spike. And then everything that we\u2019ve done in, a smaller building 510 Madison, 540 Madison and he pre-builts and the other deals that we\u2019ve done in 250, at this point today, very positive mark-to-market. Richard Anderson : Okay. Owen Thomas : Not a 20% but \u2013 so if we did a deal in 2011 at $95 a square foot at 510 Madison Avenue that business probably $150 a square foot today, that kind of mark-to-market, but we\u2019re not going to see that for while. Richard Anderson : Okay. Regarding the resident sale, understand you guys are thinking for 2015 that your dispositions will be primarily driven by non-core type of assets to make up the 750 for this year. Is residence a non-core asset to you because its non-office or was that just the price you just couldn\u2019t refuse? Douglas Linde : Yes. So the categories for the sales are as you suggest non-core, there are also assets where we think it\u2019s an interesting price. The Avant is a new asset. It\u2019s in a great location. It is residential but I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say we considered non-core for that reason. The issue is we got or the attractiveness to shareholders as we received the 4.1% cap rate on a Class A asset that\u2019s on a 54 year remaining ground lease and we thought that was attractive. Richard Anderson : And what about\u2026. Douglas Linde : And I also just before you go on \u2013 I just say this, the following about our residential business. So we are a developer. We are not an owner manager in the residential world. We don\u2019t have the portfolio size to be great at operating residential. We don\u2019t have the portfolio size to be creating a business that strategic from the perspective of, well, there\u2019s a need to have a certain massive units to sort of maintain an operating platform. So we look at the residential business as a way to utilize our development prowess to create a lot of value. In infill locations, in our market. And so to the extent that we don\u2019t deemed there to be strong overall growth in those assets, overall foreseeable point in the future and someone, as Owen said, offers us a terrific price, we\u2019re going to sell those buildings. So it\u2019s very different than the way we think about our Midtown Manhattan office or our Back Bay officer portfolio or Reston, Virginia office portfolio which have a lot of continuity and operating leverage about them that creates them to be \u201cstrategic\u201d as oppose \u201cnon-core\u201d. Richard Anderson : Is Princeton long term non-core? Douglas Linde : Princeton is a terrific portfolio that is well run now by our New York City region. It\u2019s no longer a region in itself which made a lot of sense and created some synergies from an operating expense perspective which has you\u2019re seeing the flowing through our G&A to some degrees. And as long as we continue to believe that this Princeton market will continue to expand from a user perspective and we are seeing marginal to positive rental rate growth and we still have the ability to develop buildings which allow us to create assets that are yielding significantly higher than what we could sell assets for to some third-party, we\u2019re continue to look at as a important portion of the company\u2019s portfolio. Owen Thomas : And they also I think Princeton, you have to differentiate between Carnegie Center and Tower Center which are different assets and as Doug suggested we\u2019re seeing positive leasing momentum at Carnegie Center, we were investing in the buildings. We started to build-to-suite and we have options on additional development land. Richard Anderson : Last question at Salesforce you mentioned conversations going on? Are any of those conversations with Salesforce to take on more space? Douglas Linde : We\u2019re not going to comment on any particular conversation with any particular tenant, it\u2019s not appropriate. Richard Anderson : Okay. We got it. Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Alexander Goldfarb : Good morning. Two questions. The first one, Doug, you sort of opened the door on the worst-kept secret in New York. So, if there is any color that you can provide at this point on the Naval Yards. And in the Forbes article, it mentioned a partnership with We work in San Francisco and maybe Boston. If you could just provide a little bit more color on that? Douglas Linde : So Alex, unfortunately, we\u2019re not \u2013 like I said, we\u2019re not in a position of talking about what we\u2019re doing in the outer boroughs of New York, so we can\u2019t comment on what other peoples have written. But we hope that we\u2019ll be able to announce something sooner rather than later. We did a release. We were in straight lease with work in San Francisco at [indiscernible] condition. And at this point that\u2019s the only transaction that we currently have in our portfolio with that organization. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then the second question is, going again to the declining \u2013 sorry, to the strengthening dollar, declining foreign currency. Does where the dollar has gone versus the pound, does it make you guys possibly want to reconsider looking at London or you've firmly sworn off that market and are only looking domestically? Owen Thomas : Alex I don\u2019t think the dollar pound moments are driving any thinking we\u2019re having about investing in London. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. So you\u2019re only looking domestically, you\u2019re not \u2013 you put London off, it\u2019s not in the strategic view anymore? Owen Thomas : That\u2019s not what I said. I said we\u2019re not making investment decisions in London or elsewhere based on currency fluctuations. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. I appreciate that clarification, Owen. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brendan Maiorana with Wells Fargo. Brendan Maiorana : Thanks. Good morning. Mike LaBelle, I apologize because I'm splitting hairs here, but you mentioned average occupancy for the year at 91%. I think last quarter you said 91% to 92%. So I'm not sure if that's actually a change or just 91% is still within the range. And I think you previously expected to end \u2013 have a year-end occupancy around 93%. Does that projection still hold? Michael LaBelle : I think we have \u2013 we did bring it down a little bit. We did say, 91% and 92% last quarter. We still hope to increase our occupancy getting to the 93%, I think will be pretty thought to be honest with you based upon where we\u2019re think we\u2019re going to be in the first quarter, and the fact there are lot of space that we\u2019re getting back in Boston which is again the majority of this, its highly marketable but it\u2019s going to take a little bit of a time to lease and its going to take \u2013 somebody is going to have to build that space. So, we do not anticipate that, that space is going to be occupied in 2015, it\u2019s going to be 2016 and later. So I would agree that we brought it down a little bit and we think it\u2019s going to average around 91%. It should end above 91%. Brendan Maiorana : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then Doug you mentioned in Boston, you mentioned at the base of Hancock good activity there. I think you also have 200,000 or 300,000 square feet at the Tower that Mike alluded leasing there. Can you just shed some color on how conversations with perspective tenants are going for the top of the building? Douglas Linde : It\u2019s some of the best place in Boston we are as we know we like the sort of commonly say baking the cake before we try and serve it at the base of the building with our new rebranding and our new identification of 120 Clarendon Street sort of that new address for those larger floors at the base of the building and we continue to sent proposals on that base at a pretty significant pace. I think the space at the top of the building, right now it\u2019s a little bit challenging to have conservations because this space is currently occupied by tenant that\u2019s going to moving to the low rise, and when you tour the space its fully occupied with an installation that was build 10 years. It\u2019s not what somebody sort of things about when they want to be in the kind of space that the Hancock will offer you. And so it\u2019s a little bit of a challenge but we also try and bring people to the floor to bottom below them which are just fantastic. But back to the market for that space will be slower than we think the market will be for the space at the base of the buildings that have an attractive value that the place has with the market. Brendan Maiorana : Yes I think you guys is it April when they moved down, so kind of your expectations on leasing that, do you think it\u2019s maybe a 12 month process to get that leased not a tenant in the space, but just kind of leased? Owen Thomas : I hope we are leasing people who aren\u2019t listening because we had with them or the lease environment where our projections are at different ends. Our view is that the space is going to get leased really, really quickly; our revenue recognition is going to be a different story. So our view is that we\u2019re going to have really good strong leasing on the space in calendar year 2015, some of those leases may have started for 2016 or later just because of the realities of when these expirations occur in the market place. We just don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to \u2013 if we do the space on our [Indiscernible] leasing will probably be a little bit slower but the revenue recognition will be quicker and if we do a larger block of space that revenue recognition will probably be a little bit slower but the leasing and will be quicker. Brendan Maiorana : Sure, okay thanks for the time. Operator : And our next question comes from Vance Edelson with Morgan Stanley Vance Edelson : Good morning. First back on 425 Fourth Street regardless of entitlement timing which your provided some color on, how good do you feel about the process itself and the Prop M allocation if you had to rate it somewhere between a slam dunk and very challenging? Owen Thomas : Bob, you want to take that one.... Robert Pester : Yes there is a queue of 10 million square feet of space to seek in Prop M allocation. I mean this is a fantastic site; it\u2019s a great location the city is going to look to the transportation quarter or in the benefits of being on the transportation corridor. But it\u2019s going to take some time I mean this is not something that\u2019s going to happen very quickly, it\u2019s going to take several years to get approved. Vance Edelson : Okay it makes sense. And then related to that can you share with us anything or on the potential magnitude of the project what it would be if you got all your wishes that you have put for us on the entitlement, could you ballpark the potential investment? Robert Pester : It will be approximately 7\u2026 go ahead Doug. Douglas Linde : Yes we\u2019re really \u2013 I mean basically we don\u2019t like to get in front of the jurisdictions that we\u2019re dealing with, so the current Central [Indiscernible] plan allows for around 750,000 square feet of space, residential office and retail, where at this point is unclear what the right plan should be for the property vis-\u00e0-vis is what we think where the market wants the space to be designed and what the city would like to see happen there. And those two conversations that are going to take place over the next \u201cmonths and years\u201d. Big picture, construction cost for new development in San Francisco are probably including land the whole on the armadillo are well in excess of $800 a square foot. Vance Edelson : Okay thanks for that. And then shifting gears could you comment on how important New York Street level retail is going to be for Boston properties going forward, is rental growth there something you are optimistic about and therefore is that a presence you\u2019d like to perhaps grow overtime? Owen Thomas : I think we\u2019ve had this topic of conversation before and I want to make sure I\u2019m consistent with what I have said before. We have a terrific portfolio of retail space with high opportunities for value creation in our existing buildings in Midtown Manhattan namely at General Motors building and at 601 Lexington Avenue and potentially at 399. That\u2019s where the focus of our investment is going to be, so if the question was sort of way to say are we going to be doing what Renado and SL Green and others have done in terms of going after Street we feel Condominium interest in and around the City of New York, I think the answer is at this point we\u2019re busy doing our own portfolio and looking for larger scale opportunities to put development dollars to work. Vance Edelson : Okay. And yes, you did get the just of the question. And then lastly on G&A it sounds like you have a pretty good forecast and process, what are the main variables that could push it to the high or low end of the new guidance range which is understandably fairly healthy at this point in the year, and do you think there is any chance you could exceed or come in below the range? Owen Thomas : I think that one of the wildcards in that is that always capitalized wages, and given our development pipeline I think we view that our development team and construction and leasing teams are going to be very, very busy doing transactions. So we have estimated that they are going to be and that\u2019s going to benefit that G&A. I think we are comfortable with the range that we have provided certainly, so I would be very surprised if you see something outside of that range. And the other tricky piece of this is that our \u2013 if we do a joint venture we don\u2019t necessarily have the ability to recognize that capitalize wage expense. So if some of these properties turn out to be JVs versus wholly owned assets that they can skew the numbers not insignificantly by hundreds of thousands of millions of dollars on any one project in the year. Vance Edelson : Okay. I\u2019ll leave it there, thanks very much. Operator : And our next question comes from Ian Wiseman with Credit Suisse. Ian Wiseman : Good morning. Just two questions, first on Salesforce Tower where would you guys expect to end the year with additional leasing in 2015? Owen Thomas : Ian, I would say that we expect to end the year not to similar to where we are today unless a large non-traditional lease expiration driven transaction occurs. So our view is that as we get to the end of 2015 that\u2019s when we are going to be in the heart of the procurement of leasing conversations with existing lease expirations here with tenants, but that doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t have another other type of transactions from a user who is looking for big block of space and says, -- there aren\u2019t any big block of space so we are tantalized by the opportunity to be in Salesforce Tower and we engage in a conversation with them early on that. So that could happen, but it\u2019s not really part of our expectations. In the first quarter of 2016 we would hope that we will have some additional leases done. Ian Wiseman : Got you. And just one last question, just as I think about potential refinancing down the road you\u2019ve got about $2.7 billion of debt on three buildings maturing I think in as I said 2017 at a 5.7% [ph] rate the ten years below 17% today. How should we think about sort of fast tracking some of that refinancing early on and how much capital you think you can pull out of those buildings? Owen Thomas : Well I think that as I mentioned on my notes, this is something we are clearly evaluating. I mean one of the things we are watching is what\u2019s going to happen to the 10-year over the next three months, six months, nine months, and we are watching it very closely because we clearly have the opportunity to try to do a financing early. Now there is a significant prepayment penalty associated with repaying this debt early. And if you were to do the analysis some of these debts in 2017 if you did it early your breakeven point is 75 basis points to 125 basis points on the 10-year from now until mid 2017. And if you look at the forward curve it\u2019s telling you it\u2019s going to be 50 or 70 basis points higher than that. So it\u2019s hard to make the decision at this moment in time to go and do that \u2013 pay that kind of prepayment penalty, however I think as we need to focus on, think about how we can hedge that risk. So you \u2013 thinking about interest rate hedges and as we get closer and our view of interest rates may change you may see us in 2015 take some of that financing off the table and do something early. Ian Wiseman : Ex the prepayment penalty, just where do you think you can get financing for those buildings today? Owen Thomas : In terms of size? Ian Wiseman : Well just rate. Owen Thomas : Well we do a ten year bond today at three and eight three and a quarter something like that. Mortgage is not that dissimilar maybe it\u2019s 3.5%, maybe a little bit higher some of the Life Insurance companies are trying to hang on the floor rates, so some of those floors are in the mid high threes and once you start getting them competing I think that sometimes that goes away and then the CMBS market is also a very effective financing source right now. So on the mortgage side because with 5 million in Lex, which is expiring and one of those explorations in GM building, both of those are probably going to be secured mortgages, ones JVs and one had a lot of mortgage tax to be paid that has time [ph] so we would look at that life company or the CMBS market which again is probably in the mid three somewhere. That\u2019s a significant savings from the weighted average coupon of 5.8% today. The reason I gave 5.8% is we also have a more use on [Indiscernible] that is coming due in 2016 that we should be able to improve the rate on that as well. Ian Wiseman : Got you. Thank you very much. Owen Thomas : Yes. Operator : And our next question comes from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank Vincent Chao : Hey good morning everyone. Just a final question, I hope, on sort of capital flows and whatnot. Given the comments about foreign buying demand, at least not seeing any change in it today, and also your comments about cap rates continuing to -- or potentially continuing to compress on the back of the 10-year, has that caused any material shift in those types of buyer's appetite for assets beyond just the core gateways? And then maybe a corollary to that, the acquisition market has been tough for you guys for a long time. Have any other markets outside of your current core become more interesting to you recently? Owen Thomas : So the first question is given that how cap rates are coming down, our sovereign wealth funds or offshore buyers looking at non-core markets are taking more risk. My view of that is I don\u2019t think I think the perimeter is probably staying pretty much the same. I think core gateway cities is still a primary focus for offshore investors. That being said I do there is a little bit of a trend for some of these groups to go up the risk curve. So I think you are seeing here particularly in New York there have been a number of Chinese investors who have gotten involved in development projects. So I think if there is a I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a change but I think if there is somewhat of a trend as you might see more offshore buyers moving up the risk spectrum in their real estate investing in core markets. And then on your second question is, does the aggressive pricing in our core markets today lead us to look at transactions or acquisitions outside of the core markets? As we have mentioned in the past there are a small handful of other cities and areas that are interesting to us because they have certainly they have a strong creative tendency which is driving a lot of growth in the office business today and also these market demonstrate value creation for real estate and office in particular over a long period of time. So we are consistently and constantly looking at that type of thing, but the issue is the pricing that we described in our core market isn\u2019t substantially different in these new markets I mean the offshore investors are also very active in a number of these places. So I don\u2019t think we would do that because pricing is really substantially different. Vincent Chao : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And our final question comes from Ross Nussbaum with UBS. Ross Nussbaum : Douglas Linde : This is Doug. I think the stated operating philosophy that we have had since the great financial distress of 2008 was that we should make sure that our dividend is appropriately sized vis-\u00e0-vis the taxable income. And that to the extent that our taxable income should be going up, we would be increasing our ordinary dividend. And one of the things that happen when you sell what was the number Mike? Michael Walsh : $73 billion. Douglas Linde : $0.72 a share of earnings on your taxable income doesn\u2019t go up as large as much as it might. So it gives push into a return of capital based upon the gains on sale, which I guess are we consider to be a very good thing. So it\u2019s retarded the overall growth in our taxable income and to the extent that that is no longer part of our operating strategy from a capital recycling perspective the dividend is going to go up. Overtime if you look back, Mike what is it ten years? The average dividend yield for the company has been I think over 4%. So relative to where other dividends are and certainly in our space we think we have a pretty healthy dividend, it just comes in a little bit of bulkier manner as opposed to a constant recurring dividend yield that\u2019s been paid out on a quarterly basis. Ross Nussbaum : And as you pointed out\u2026 Douglas Linde : Yes and I think we\u2019ve had special dividends in like five of the last ten years. So if you look at that together with the regular dividend than our dividend yield is significantly higher than otherwise. Ross Nussbaum : Yes and that all makes perfect sense. And if I had been a shareholder for the bulk of that period certainly I would have been rewarded for it, but I am thinking in terms of if I may potential shareholder looking at buying the stock can I rely on getting those special dividends kind of every other year, every three years or what I like to have little bit more security or higher recurring dividend or a better balance between those two in the future. Douglas Linde : If we don\u2019t sell you will have a higher dividend because the earnings will be significantly higher, but if we continue to sell you will continue to get dividend in the form of a return of capital or gain on sell. Michael LaBelle : And as the cash flow comes in on your developments, the $2.1 billion that is going to be delivering between 2015 and 2018 I mean that goes right into our taxable income as those cash flows come in, so that will be its nature increase our taxable income and require an increase in our dividend overtime. I mean such if during that period of time we think that sales are the right strategy, then we might have specials. Ross Nussbaum : Thank you. Operator : At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to management for any additional remarks. Owen Thomas : Okay. Well that concludes our remarks and Q&A as hopefully we were able to demonstrate, we\u2019ve made terrific progress executing our business, we increased our guidance for the year despite announcing a significant asset sale and we thank you all for your attention. Operator : And this concludes today's Boston Properties conference call. Thank you, again, for attending, and have a good day.",

During the question-and-answer portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, our Executive Vice President of Acquisitions and Development, and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks. Owen Thomas : Thanks Arista, good morning, everyone. I\u2019m joined here in Boston by Doug, Mike and our local team. This morning I\u2019ll provide an update on how we\u2019re viewing the economy and its impacts on our markets and business. I\u2019ll discuss our result and capital allocation approach and progress. And lastly we\u2019ll provide some high level remarks on the quarter. Doug will provide an overview of our operation including leasing market conditions and activity as well as progress on our developments and then Mike will wrap up with a more detailed financial summary of the quarter. So, starting with the economy, we continue to experience a very hospitable environment for real-estate investment with support of capital and property market conditions. On the capital markets side, as you know, interest rates have been stable over the last quarter as measured by the 10-Year U.S. Treasury which decreased only slightly over the quarter about 20 basis points. Though the Fed\u2019s fund rate is extraordinarily low relative to the level of economic growth and unemployment in the U.S. There are headwinds for interest rate increases by the fed driven by very low interest rate environment outside the U.S., the prospect of a further rise in the dollar and somewhat tepid economic indicators. That being said we and market consensus would expect the fed to increase rates later this year. However, we\u2019re not convinced such a move will have an immediate negative effect on real-estate fund flows and values. Long-term rates or the 10-Year U.S. Treasury is a more important proxy for real-estate capital markets. And it has not historically moved up in direct correlation with Fed funds rate increases. Further, today there is a healthy spread between cap rates and long-term interest rates versus historical averages. These factors plus the likely rent increases associated with an improving economy should help cushion the impact of short-term interest rate increases. Now, private investor enthusiasm for real-estate remains at elevated levels particularly for high quality office assets in our core markets. Significant transactions were completed or announced in the U.S. in U.S. real-estate in the first quarter involving investors from Europe, Canada, Asia and Australia. The yield gap between the fixed income markets and real-estate is driving increasing capital flows into our asset class and when we do not yet see declining oil prices or an appreciated dollar diminishing offshore demand for U.S. real-estate. Now moving to economic growth and the property markets, as you know, the economy grew 2.4% last year and is predicted to be relatively weak in the first quarter. The unemployment rate has decreased to 5.5% as of the end of March. Job creation has been relatively strong over the past year averaging around 260,000 jobs per month though the figures for March were less than 50% of preceding year\u2019s average. Though these top line numbers demonstrate relative economic strength growth appears to us as reflected through our lands of tenant demand to continue to be concentrated among technology, Life Sciences and other creative tenant. As a result, our location is best positioned for this demand continues to outperform namely San Francisco and parts of Boston. One additional area of strength is from smaller asset management and financial advisory firms in New York City given heavier regulation of the financial segment, there appears to be some deconstruction of larger firms occurring, creating new tenant demand for high quality space in good locations. Oil prices have remained low over the quarter but this has had no direct impact on our activities given we do not operate in energy driven markets. The appreciated dollar though headwind for international corporate earnings has also not yet had a direct impact on our activities. So, in summary on the environment we believe capital values are more advanced in the cycle of an underlying fundamentals in all our core markets, prices per square-foot per office buildings are at all-time highs while rents have not returned to 2000 levels though it is certainly as close in San Francisco. We\u2019re seeing an upside driven by operating fundamentals and further cap rate compression, so logically we\u2019re more actively investing our capital in new developments rather than existing asset acquisitions. Further, we\u2019re taking advantage of private market pricing by funding this activity through targeted asset sales. Now, moving to the specifics on capital strategy for the quarter, the pursuit of acquisitions remains for us active but challenging. New investments considered in existing buildings must have some type of competitive angle for us such as providing tax protection to the use of our operating partnership unit as consideration or potentially working with the financial partner. We are spending more time looking at new investments and development sites or buildings requiring repositioning both of which leverage our development and operating skill. We continue to be active with dispositions. As you know so far this year, we\u2019ve completed the sale of the avenue in Washington DC and our land parcel in suburban Maryland for a total value of $205 million. We continue to evaluate disposition candidates that involve buildings in locations that are no longer strategic to us and/or buildings or we can achieve attractive pricing relative to the cash flow characteristics of the asset. Given our transaction pipeline currently under consideration, we continue to estimate dispositions could total $750 million in 2015 likely comprised more of individual building sales rather than large scale joint ventures. As mentioned, we continue to emphasize development for our new investment activities given the opportunity we see to recycle capital from the sale of our older buildings into new projects with higher returns. Our existing development pipeline consists of 11 projects representing 3.3 million square feet with a total projected cost of $2.1 billion. We forecast these projects would generate over 7% cash NOI yield upon completion over the next three years. We have all the capital required to complete these developments with $1.1 billion in unrestricted cash currently on our balance sheet. The pre-leasing of our development pipeline has increased to 61% due primarily to excellent progress in the leasing of 888 Boylston Street in Boston. In addition, we have a very significant portfolio of pre-development opportunities in all our core markets consisting of either sites, options on sites or existing asset redevelopment. Though this pipeline consists of opportunities available to us for many years in the future, in 2015, we estimate we could move approximately $1 billion in pre-development projects into our active development pipeline. These potential projects include the first and podium phase of North Station consisting of 360,000 square feet of retail and law space, law office space located adjacent to the TD Garden in Boston, 160,000 square-foot residential development located in our Kendall Center project in Cambridge, a 600,000 square-foot residential and retail development located in our Reston Town Center project. Three different potential office build-to-suit opportunities in the Washington DC region representing in the aggregate over 1.3 million square feet, two possible suburban office developments in the Waltham Market totaling over 300,000 feet, a new development in New York City, which we are unable to comment on in detail at this point in time. Significant improvement projects at 601 Lexington Avenue in New York and 100 Federal Street in Boston both of, which were enhanced and add high value retail amenities to the building. Before launching any of these projects, we need to complete the entitlement and planning process and in most cases some level of pre-leasing. This next wave of development will include a significant allocation to multi-family projects where we anticipate the initial yields to be closer to 6% than the 7% initial cash NOI yield we\u2019ve been able to achieve on our office project. Lastly, moving to results for the first quarter, we continue to perform well and made strong progress towards executing our goals. As you know, diluted FFO for the first quarter was $1.30 per share, which is well above our forecast and consensus. However, significant portion if not all of, the beat was due to lease termination income. We\u2019re also increasing our full-year guidance and Mike will take you through the details. We had an active quarter in leasing having completed 91 deals representing 1.5 million square feet with Washington DC representing 40% of the activity by square-footage. Notwithstanding the vibrant leasing activity, the occupancy of our in-service properties dropped to 90.3% from 91.7% due to the previously communicated move-out of Manulife and State Street at the Hancock Tower. So, let me turn the discussion over to Doug for a further review. Doug Linde : Thanks Owen, good morning everybody. I\u2019m going to focus my comments this morning on the operating additions in our market and our portfolio, and that includes our existing development assets. I\u2019m also going to say a few things sort of sprinkled throughout my comments about some specific property investment and leasing decisions that we are making in the operating portfolio. And they have some impacts on our future results, so I just sort of want to give you a little foreshadowing of some of those things as well. So, as Owen said, overall leasing in the quarter was 1.5 million square feet which is actually pretty similar to where it was in 2014. But it\u2019s actually pretty high on a relative basis, the last 10 years our average was about 1.1 million square feet. I wanted to spend a couple of minutes talking about the leasing statistics that I did notice a few things in the notes about them. If you think back to what we discussed last year, we talked a lot about the major law-firm lease expirations primarily in New York City. And you may recall that we explain that in some cases, the leases had a very significant roll-up at the General Motors building with Weil and at 601 Lexington with Kirkland & Ellis. But that at 599 Lexington Avenue, Reed Smith and K&L Gates, were also renewals that we did but there was a roll-down. Well, the two renewals at the 599 Lexington Avenue, this property 250,000 square feet are actually in the first quarter 2015 leasing statistics leading to that reduction in the mark-to-market in that particular place. If you look forward at our New York City lease expirations over the next few years, based on current market rents, the overall mark-to-market is basically flat to slightly positive. And the majority of the rollover is at 399 and at 601 where Citibank is going to be doing their consolidation from to their properties out in Greenwich Street. In Boston and in San Francisco, as you can see from our leasing stats and the supplemental, the improvement in market conditions is reflected in the mark-to-market, we were up 14% in Boston and 37% at San Francisco and that\u2019s running through the portfolio. In DC, the statistics are biased by a flat as is renewal on a 260,000 square-foot lease with the GSA in Northern Virginia but they still are pretty fair reflection of overall market conditions, not a lot of movement in DC. Now let\u2019s turn to the actual markets themselves. So, in DC, there have been a number of re-analyst market events in the last couple of weeks. And I assume many of you have either seeing first hand what\u2019s been going on down there or read the summaries. But simply put, the DC market predominantly the CVD continues to be very competitive since, there isn\u2019t lot of significant increases in demand. We are competing for and winning market share, on our vacated law-firm based on our JV properties, so at Market Square North, where we\u2019re getting 90,000 square feet back, we\u2019ve already released 60,000 square feet. We are getting this space back in July of \u201815, but as with all the new long-term deals in DC, there is free rent so, there is going to be very little income recognition from that space into late in 2016. We also completed another 38,000 square feet of extensions in that building. At 901 New York Avenue, we talked about the 250,000 square-foot Finnegan lease renewal last quarter but as part of that deal, we are providing 40,000 square feet of currently rented space as free swing space as the concession to the tenant. It\u2019s going to begin in August and they\u2019re going to have that space free for the duration of 2016. We also got back 90,000 square feet from another firm and we\u2019ve completed 34,000 square feet of leases there most of those have already started. And our availability is down to 45,000 square feet in a 556,000 square-foot building. And then finally in our JVs, at Net Square, we have about 200,000 square feet expiring at the end of 2015 including 122,000 square feet at the top of the building and this space continues to be some of the best space in the city. The one wholly owned building where we have some near term exposure, law-firm expiration is at 1330 Connecticut Avenue and we\u2019re actively engaged in conversations there to retain that major tenant. There does continue to be additional supply coming into the DC market in the formerly the personally let buildings for lead tenants, the space there vacating as well as stacking the construction in the CBD and NOMA and in Southwest. Our development at 601 Mass is scheduled to open in five months, the building is 83% leased and it\u2019s income contribution is going to ramp up in 2016. Reston Town Center continues to be the best performing market in the DC region, it\u2019s the combination of walk-able retail, high quality new multifamily community programming and improving access to metro, all continue to draw new tenants to that market. Small tenant demand is strong, technology tenants are expanding, we have Google and FireEye and Appian who all have expanded in the last quarter. And Bechtel which moved to Reston Overlook in July of 2012 now leases 290,000 square feet from us. And we continue to try and relocate other tenants that they can bring they are relocating to the Town Center. Earlier this month, we negotiated the recapture of 55,000 square feet at our Overlook property in order to provide expansion to Bechtel and we\u2019re working on another two floors in that same building for 2016. Our design and permitting on blocks four and five in the urban core for an additional 520 residential units and 275,000square-foot office building is progressing. And we are working towards an early 2016 commencement the apartment component. The Avant, which is the apartment building that we have now completed in Reston finished the first quarter at 95% leased, 15 months after its initial November 2013 opening. And as Owen said, we continue to chase a large GSA consolidation requirement in Springfield Virginia, we\u2019re actively making proposals on 1001 Fifth Street and we have to build the suites that we\u2019re chasing in Reston as well. The market with the most significant pick-up activity is clearly New York City this quarter for us. It\u2019s been a really good market but with 10% availability and lots of uncommitted new construction, rental increases are pretty moderate still. During our last call, we talked about early loss from renewals. This quarter, we find ourselves in a position of having multiple tenants looking for expansion space with limited availability on our portfolio. At 601 Lexington Avenue, we have leased the first floor of our 2016 City expiration. This resulted in a termination payment and a reduction in our remaining 2015 revenue. We\u2019re in discussions on two additional floors and have 200,000 square feet tenant looking for additional space in the building. With virtually no vacancy, our New York team is actively looking at ways we can control currently leased space for the benefit of these growing users. We\u2019re also in the planning stages on major repositioning of the retail and the low rise of 601, that\u2019s 138,000 square feet on floors three through six. And hope to be able to share those plans in the coming quarter. At 599 Lexington Avenue, in order to speed up the rebuilding process for our recent law-firm renewals and get that space back on to the market quicker, this quarter we negotiated a full floor recapture with a payment from the tenant to allow us to provide three swing space and from mid 2016. As further evidence of good activity in Manhattan, a year ago we had 95,000 square feet of availability and expirations at 540 Madison. In the past 12 months, we\u2019ve done 12 deals on 80,000 square feet including six deals and 53,000 square feet since the beginning of 2015. And today, we\u2019re sitting on 15,000 square feet of availability and we have actions on 10,000 of that right now. At 250 West 55th Street, we are in lease discussions with 11 separate tenants ranging from 5,000 square feet pre-built suite to two-floor users for over 145,000 square feet of the 188,000 square feet of available space, that\u2019s lease discussions not tours. The bulk of our available space today is on floors 30 through 35 and our rents range from the low $90s to well over $100 per square-foot for the top of the building. Our taking rents are very consistent with the forward-looking pro forma expectations when we restarted the building in 2011 though our concessions are higher. A lot has been written about the values and the rents associated with high-end retail space, specifically on Fifth Avenue, where we\u2019re coming up on the lease expiration of FAO Schwarz at the end of 2016. The FAO space is over 60,000 square feet includes 14,000 square feet on the ground, 34,000 square feet on the second floor which has 20-foot slab-to-slab ceiling and 11,000 square feet of concord space. On the one hand, the front door for this space is 125 feet off of Fifth Avenue front and the other were told 4.6 million people visit the Apple store on an annual basis. The FAO Schwarz space is going to go through a major renovation and downtime as part of any re-leasing and if possible that we may be able to work with FAO to expedite this transition sooner than the expiration of their lease. Princeton continues to outperform the New Jersey markets. During the quarter, we completed 260,000 square feet of leasing and we continue to see expansion from the far end pharmaceutical tenants. Our suburban New York team engineered a very creative recapture with a tenant payment again and relocation in order to secure a 10-year commitment from Solvay a global chemical company for 110,000 square feet and a new addition to Carnegie Center. Switching over to Boston, the Kendall Square market of Cambridge continues to dramatically outperform the rest of the urban Boston market with asking rents well over $70 per square-foot. Our Cambridge portfolio is essentially 100% leased and we have no short-term availability. What we do have our existing tenants that want to expand. There are a number of large expansion requirements in the market. We are working with the city on the up-toning of our Kendall Square project up to 600,000 square feet of office space. And the Volpe transportation site continues to be a potential expansion for the market. But the marketing process there has been delayed. Our residential project as Owen said, adjacent to Kendall Center has received its entitlement during the quarter. And we hope to commence construction in 2015. In the Back Bay, we\u2019re underway with our repositioning and re-branding at 120 St. James, the Hancock Tower low-rise where we have 170,000 square feet of availability. Our asking rents on the low-rise base at the Hancock Tower are lower than the rents across the river in Cambridge. The base building work will be completed in the third quarter. Our 150,000 square feet block at the top of the tower is still under lease until the middle of the summer. While it is certainly available to show, the space, 20 years old won\u2019t be in a market ready condition until the end of the year. Realistically, we are not likely to have rent recognition or commencement on these blocks until the back half of \u201816. However, when fully leased, the available space at the Hancock Tower should generate close to 40% increase over expiring rents. At 888 Boylston Street we signed leases for four additional floors bringing our committed space to 232,000 square feet of the 350,000 square feet of office space. The historically difficult weather we experienced January through March did impact our construction spend during the first quarter but we still anticipate having tenants in the space during the third quarter of 2016. We are having extensive conversations with retailers for the 65,000 square feet of retail space at 888, the prudential flagship expansion which is well underway as well as our major food court renovation repositioning. We hope to have a number of signed leases to report over the next few months or days. Our predevelopment activity at North Station in the Back Bay Garage which involved designing and permitting are ongoing. The Waltham Metro West market continues to get stronger driven by expansion by life science and tech companies. While there were tenants that are relocating to urban locations, there continues to be urban growth on 128. We have limited current vacancy in our suburban portfolio. The harsh weather had minimal impact on our two Waltham developments and we expect to deliver our stack retail building which is now 100% committed in October of this year, and 10 City Point 74% leased is on schedule for rent commencement in mid 2016. In the phase of lots of growing tech demand, we\u2019re working with the owners of 1265 Main Street, that\u2019s the former pulled away property adjacent to City Point to complete a 50-50 joint venture and 119,000 square-foot lease with a global shoe company. This development would commence construction next quarter. This project is part of a larger master-plan that could allow for over an additional 1 square feet of office and retail development in the future. Finally going to San Francisco, San Francisco continues to have the strongest overall demand in the country. And as we\u2019ve discussed in the past, with the expected [indiscernible] restrictions coming into play it\u2019s only going to be facing more and more supply challenges. Other than new development, there is perhaps one block of 150,000 square feet of available contiguous space in the City. And unlike in the first quarter of \u201813 to \u201814, there have been no big deals this quarter other than 200,000 square-foot Uber deal [indiscernible] market, likely the lack of available supply maybe a factor. Overall activity in the market while down from the first quarter of \u201814 when you had the Salesforce and the Twitter and the Dropbox deals or large deals get done, actively continues to be very strong. During the quarter, we completed four single or multi-floor office lease renewals at EC totaling 174,000 square feet. The mark-to-market on a growth space was between 35% and 70%. None of these transactions are in our same-store statistics for the quarter. These deals had starting rents between $65 and $73 per square-foot. We are actively engaged with additional full floor tenants with 2016 and 2017 leased expirations. There were significant opportunities for rental increases in all of our transactions in Embarcadero Center. I do want to mention though, one trend that we are seeing is San Francisco particularly in high-rise space. There has been significant compression in the market between the less expensive and the premium space. During the last cycle, the range of starting rents we thought EC was from the low $40s to close to $90 a square-foot. Today, the range is more like the low $60s to the mid-$80s. At 535 Mission, we\u2019ve now completed leases with four tenants and have two more leases out for signature which will bring us the 240,000 square feet or 79% of lease. We have a number of active full floor proposals under discussion on the remaining four floors and our acting rents are in the high 70s about 10% higher than our original pro forma. Construction at Salesforce Tower continues to progress. We were overly aggressive with our spending schedule for 2015 and our contractor has allocated a heavier spend to 2016. With the mid-2017 delivery for space at the top of the building, we\u2019re still not yet in the window for much in the way of leased expiration driven leasing under our 100,000 square feet. However, our marketing team continues to actively market the building across the bay area, and there is a continuous flow of users that have expressed interest in the building. Over the last quarter, we had 12 preliminary presentations for users in excess of 50,000 square feet. That was a lot of information I went quickly. But I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike to jump into the financials. Mike LaBelle : Okay, thanks Doug. Good morning everybody. I\u2019m not going to spend too much time talking about the debt markets today because we really don\u2019t have any significant debt maturities this year. We also continue to have meaningful cash balances in excess of $1.6 billion which does include $534 million of currently restricted cash that has held for a possible 1031 exchange. We are focused however on our loan maturities in late 2016 and \u201817 which primarily consists of six mortgage loans with our share of the outstanding balance totaling $2.9 billion. These loans have weighted average interest rate of 5.8% which provides a great opportunity to reduce our interest expense by 2017. Assuming the current 10-year treasury rate, we maybe - the current forward 10-year treasury rate, we may be able to reduce the coupon on this borrowing by almost 200 basis points which could result in more than $55 million of possible annual interest savings in the future. Now, these loans have yield maintenance, pre-payment premiums. And they were looking at a variety of strategies to pre-pay them early. We see it as relatively expensive today. What we\u2019ve done is we started to layer in some forward starting swaps to hedge the index rate on a portion of the refinancing opportunity. And today we\u2019ve locked in $300 million at a forward starting swap rate in September of 2016 at 2.45%. The average forward premium is 33 basis points and the swap spread is 12 basis points. So we\u2019ve locked in based on an average current 10-year treasure rate of about 2%. Our strategy will likely be a combination of early refinancing, possibly in 2015 and hedging the interest rate risk for financings in 2016 and 2017. Our hedging program has no impact on our 2015 earnings and our guidance does not include any refinancing activity in 2015. So, turning to our earnings for the quarter, we reported diluted funds from operation of $1.30 per share which is $0.07 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range. The majority of the variance is due to termination income which totaled $14 million for the quarter and was $12 million or $0.07 per share higher than we had projected. One piece of our termination income was a distribution we received from our claim against the bankrupt Lehman Brothers at State of $4.5 million. We continue to hold the claim against Lehman related to the termination of its lease at 399 Park Avenue in 2009. And we believe the remaining claim value to be roughly $5 million. We\u2019ve not projected income from any additional possible distributions in 2015. As Doug mentioned, we orchestrated three significant lease terminations in our New York region this quarter. The earnings impact is the acceleration of income into the first quarter and a reduction of revenue from these spaces during the remainder of 2015 and in some cases in 2016. If you exclude the terminations, the performance of our portfolio exceeded our expectations by about $2 million or $0.01 per share. All of this was in rental revenue as we completed several early renewals with nice rent up-ticks in New York City and in San Francisco and completed new leasing both in Embarcadero and in our Gateway project in San Francisco ahead of our projections. The rental increases on our early renewal activity does not show up in our leasing statistics this quarter as the new cash rental rates will not take effect until the natural lease expirations in 2016. And lastly our interest expense was higher than our projection by $0.01 per share due to lower capitalized interest than we projected. Looking at the rest of 2015, and our guidance for the year, our out-performance in the first quarter was mostly termination income. As I mentioned, we would be losing the rental income projected for these spaces for the rest of 2015. We project the income loss for these deals to the remainder of \u201815 to be approximately $0.02 per share. So the net increase you should expect in our guidance from the first quarter out-performance is $0.05 per share. Our occupancy dropped to 90.3% as we forecasted due primarily to the loss of 350,000 square feet of occupancy in Boston at the Hancock Tower. For the rest of the year, we anticipate average occupancy of, just under 91%. As we\u2019ve discussed in our prior calls, our same-store growth will be negatively impacted in 2015 but the anticipated reduction in our average same store occupancy from 2014. Offsetting this however is the positive impact of the projected roll-up in rents in our leasing activity. This quarter, we completed several early renewals with rental rate increases and in San Francisco we\u2019re actively working on several more early renewals of leases that expire in 2016. Deals could improve our 2015 GAAP rental income as future rental increases are straight-lined into 2015. As a result of the leasing activity we see, we expect our GAAP same-store NOI to be relatively flat in \u201815 versus \u201814 and expect growth of negative 0.5% to positive 0.5%. This represents an improvement of 25 basis points over our same-store guidance last quarter. On a cash basis, we also expect relatively flat same-store growth of 0% to 0.5%, which is down slightly from last quarter due to a couple of the terminations in New York City happening earlier than we projected. As you know, we exclude termination income from our same-store specifics. The lease-up of our development pipeline is consistent with our projections last quarter. The projects that impact 2015 and are not part of our same-store include 250 West 55th Street, 680 and 690 Folsom, 535 Mission, 99 Third Avenue, 601 Mass Avenue and the Avant and are in aggregate projected to add an incremental $54 million to $60 million of NOI in 2015. Our non-cash straight-line and fair-value lease revenue is projected to be $85 million to $95 million in 2015. And it includes only our share of our joint venture properties. We project our hotel to generate $12 million to $14 million of NOI in 2015. For our development and management services fee income, we\u2019re projecting $17 million to $22 million for 2015, that\u2019s in-line with our guidance last quarter. We project our G&A expense to be $96 million to $100 million in 2015 also in-line with our projection last quarter. As Doug mentioned, we experienced weather related impacts on our development projects in Boston in the first quarter would float our developments then. And we\u2019ve also re-projected the timing of our development spend at Salesforce Tower. None of these changes are expected to impact our completion schedule but they do have an impact on our capitalized interest projections. The result is an increase to our 2015 forecasted interest expense to $423 million to $433 million for the full year. We project our capitalized interest to be $30 million to $40 million. Our forecast for non-controlling interest and property partnerships is unchanged from last quarter. For the full year 2015, we project the FFO deduction for non-controlling interest and property partnerships to be $135 million to $145 million. So, when we combine all of our assumptions and results in our projected 2015 guidance range for funds from operation of $5.35 to $5.45 per share. This is an increase in our guidance range of $0.04 per share at the mid-point and includes $0.07 from the first quarter performance, $0.02 of projected improvement in our same-store portfolio offset by the loss of $0.05 per share due to lower capitalized interest. Although Owen mentioned the possibility of additional asset sales, we have not included any additional asset sales in our updated guidance for 2015. For the second quarter 2015, we project funds from operation of $1.32 to $1.34 per share. Our development pipeline continues to be a meaningful growth vehicle for us. And in 2015, it is projected to provide 6% to 7% FFO growth to the company. This in combination with lower interest expense from reducing our debt load, is projected to add $86 million to our 2015 FFO at the mid-point versus 2014. As I mentioned, our same-store portfolio is relatively flat this year due to a temporary dip in our occupancy. In addition, the impact of our sales program in the past year has resulted in the loss of $72 million of FFO from 2014 to 2015. Despite these two headwinds, we are still projecting to generate between 2% and 4% FFO growth year-over-year. That completes our formal remarks. I\u2019d appreciate if the operate would open the lines up for questions. Operator : Your first call is from Gabriel Hilmoe from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Gabriel Hilmoe : Thanks. Doug, just on the Volpe site in Cambridge, I know you mentioned it was delayed, but just anymore details you can provide there on the process and how that\u2019s progressing? Doug Linde : The GSA is obviously, works on their own schedule and they just, they were in expectation that they were going to put an RFP out in the first quarter of 2015 and lo and behold it hasn\u2019t happened yet. Right now, the rumors on the street are that there is going to be something that comes out before the end of the year. But again no one really knows. Gabriel Hilmoe : Okay. And then just on 1016 in DC, you mentioned some active proposals there, but any more color you can provide there just in terms of the depth of the pipeline? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of what activity has been like with some of the larger users in DC recently? Doug Linde : I\u2019ll have a couple of comments and then I\u2019ll let Ray to pick up. But basically it\u2019s a 500,000 plus or minus square-foot building. So, the users that we\u2019re talking to are really users who are in excess of 300,000 square feet. We made two or three proposals wherein, I\u2019d say the latter stages of from discussions, with some tenants that are looking at us as well as other potential build-to-suites and I\u2019ll let Ray give some commentary on that. Ray Ritchey : Well, I think you hit the nail in the head there Doug with this, this is a situation where clearly we\u2019re not going to go spec. And there is a careful balance between how much of pre-lease we have to make to justify going forward. But I mean the great thing about that building that side is a terrific site for the demographics that we\u2019re trying to attract to the building. And our price basis there is extremely competitive relative to other new options. So, I think we\u2019re very competitive with the people we\u2019re talking to. And should we go forward, we\u2019re very confident in a lease, and lease very strong referring. Gabriel Hilmoe : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citigroup. Your line is open. Michael Bilerman : Yes, good morning. Owen, you talked about this $1 billion of potential pre-development projects moving into starts or into the development pipeline this year. And you rattled off a long list of projects which likely exceed well over multi-billions of dollars of spend even at your share. So I\u2019m just curious, the $1 billion doesn\u2019t seem like a big hurdle to get over. And what would be the most likely scenario, maybe sort of goalpost of what it could be in terms of new development coming on into the pipeline this year? Doug Linde : I did, Michael as you say, I did go through a number of different projects because I wanted you and shareholders to know what the breadth of our pipeline was. In that list that I gave does exceed $1 billion but we probably won\u2019t launch all those projects. There are contingent obviously on entitlement, on full planning but also many of them contingent on pre-leasing. So if we can do more than $1 billion that would be terrific, we\u2019re certainly working hard to achieve that. But when we looked at the pipeline and we estimate what we think we\u2019ll be able to launch this year, we put the estimate more at $1 billion. Michael Bilerman : And then on the at FAO Schwarz space at the GM building, if you look at the lease roll schedule, I\u2019m not sure if that rent is there. I think, Doug, you said it was the end of 2016. Doug Linde : Yes, it actually fills up in \u201817. So that\u2019s where the number is, and if you look it in our supplemental. Michael Bilerman : Right. So that\u2019s like $260 a foot. Grade level rents in that location are thousands of dollars, well over $4,000 that grade. So just maybe you can walk through a little bit of the potential amount of capital that you think you\u2019re going to have to invest and effectively the targeted NOI effective upside because that could be a game changer, something going from $250 well into the thousands? Owen Thomas : Well, I can only make some cursory comments and I\u2019ll let John Powers continue on. So, I, there seems to be a euphoria about what potential rents might be on Fifth Avenue locations and while we are very strong believers in the value of our real-estate. The ground floor is where the people are getting those big numbers not on all of the space, right. So, we have 14,000 square feet of ground floor space and it\u2019s deeper than a typical floor would be. But we don\u2019t know what the up or the appropriate level of rent will be, the market won\u2019t let us know. Then we have some space that is below grade then we have sizeable amount of space on the second floor. So, as you think about the overall value that we might be able to achieve from that 64,000 square-foot piece of space if this kind of sort of categorize it appropriately. With regards to improvements, for the most part, tenants are putting the work in themselves. There will likely be some work that\u2019s done to a plaza and Apple has talked about maybe doing some things to their store. But well, I\u2019ll stop there and let John continue on. John Powers : Well, I think Carnegie has done very well. And I think we\u2019re very optimistic about that but there are a lot of moving parts right now. And as Doug said, a lot of the space is not right on Fifth Avenue and is not on grade. Although there are a lot of people visiting the Apple Store so we\u2019re pretty optimistic but there are a lot of moving parts. Michael Bilerman : Okay. And just last question for LaBelle, the $534 million that is sitting for 1031, what is the timing of that? Is there any sort of, anything in the pipe? And if you can\u2019t identify something, how should we think about the distribution or any taxing of that? Mike LaBelle : So, basically we have a policy of - we\u2019re always setting up these 1031s whenever we sell assets, just in case we find some opportunity. And then we have 45 days to identify and six months to close. So, within the next six months we have to either find something to buy that fits or that money comes out of the escrow arrangement. At this point, obviously we\u2019re actively looking at opportunities but as Owen described and we\u2019ve described for quite a while, it\u2019s challenging to find things that are going to fit what we\u2019re looking for. So the likelihood of us being able to do that is, I mean, it\u2019s uncertain but it could be low. If it comes out of the escrow it doesn\u2019t mean that there is some sort of special distribution associated with it. We have indicated in our supplemental that the gains associated with the assets that we sold thus far are about $95 million. So, that would be the number that approximates what the tax gain would be for those sales. And presuming we\u2019re right in line with our taxable income where our regular dividend is right now, that would drive potentially a special dividend. Obviously that depends on what the ultimate taxable income is for the company this year. But the $534 million is not something that would be part of the distribution, that would actually come into the company now than as unrestricted cash and be funded for our development pipeline. Michael Bilerman : Right, and then obviously depending on the other $700 million or the gross $700 million of sales that Owen referenced, it could create some other taxable gains or a need for 1031 in a special? Mike LaBelle : It could, yes. Doug Linde : I mean, honestly Michael, I think it\u2019s fair to say that if we\u2019re successful in selling $1 billion worth of properties, it is unlikely that we will be able to reinvest that asset and all of the assets. And there will be some additional special dividend in calendar year 2015 not similar to us having one in calendar year \u201813 and calendar year \u201814. Michael Bilerman : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jed Reagan from Green Street Advisors. Your line is open. Jed Reagan : Good morning guys. It looks like same-store operating expenses and real estate taxes increased last quarter at a faster clip than it has recently. I just wonder if you can comment on what\u2019s driving that and whether we could expect that to continue for the rest of the year? Mike LaBelle : I think that when we look at our margins Jed and I think our margins, have been generally stable between the mid 65% to mid 66% range. So I expect us to continue to be operating in that range. I mean, we do we have seen some tax increases obviously in New York City. And we did for the first quarter, we saw some utility increases and we also saw snow related increases honestly that had a pretty significant impact in the Boston marketplace. We will recover some of that. But that recovery comes over the remainder of the year effectively, some portion of it comes in the first quarter, but the rest kind of is accrued through the rest of the year. So, I do think that expenses were a little bit higher in the first quarter but generally our margins are in line with where we expect. Jed Reagan : Okay, thanks. And you guys offered some pretty upbeat comments on the Manhattan fundamentals market. I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019re seeing big banks and law-firms in Midtown starting to bake growth plans into their space needs more now or is it still mostly contraction mode for those sectors? Owen Thomas : John, you want to try that one? John Powers : Well, in our portfolio we took care of most of the law-firm expirations that were out before 2020 last year. So, those contractions, they are rebuilding the space now and all their plans were locked in last year, are locked in now. Clearly, the market is doing well but as tenants move, the resize, Skadden of course will make a major move. And our recon on that is that they will have some right-sizing in their portfolio. So I think that trend will be going on for a long time. It really only, the only opportunity that the firm has is to right-size is when they rebuild. Owen Thomas : So, just to give you a little more color on that. I would say that we are seeing the mid-size financials firms, in some law-firms expanding, not expanding significantly but expanding. So as I suggested, at 601 Lexington Avenue, we have two tenants, one is a law-firm and one of them is a financial firm and they are both looking for more space in that building. They are not looking for going from 100 to 150 they\u2019re looking going from 100 to 120 or from 100 to 130 that sort of the range. And I would expect that some of the demand is being driven at 250 West 55th Street is both the efficiency associated with being a brand new building and all that brings to it, but a modest amount of growth, I mean, modest meaning 5% to 10% kind of growth. You may speak to those larger financial institutions, I haven\u2019t seen much in the way there. Doug Linde : No, I think on the large financials, financial employment growth has been weak in New York. And I don\u2019t see, we haven\u2019t seen certainly expansion by large scale financials. I do think some of the contractions have stabilized. Jed Reagan : Okay, great. John Powers : This is John Powers. My comment was regarding only the law-firms, certainly on the smaller financials we\u2019ve had pretty robust growth in the last quarter. Jed Reagan : Okay, that is helpful. Thanks, all. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Jamie Feldman : Great. Thank you, good morning. So I guess my first question, I appreciate your color on the investment sales market. How should we be thinking about how much more of the portfolio you would be willing to sell or JV given where current prices and demand are? Owen Thomas : Jamie, its Owen, as I mentioned our - we sold little over $200 million so far this year. We\u2019re evaluating some additional asset sales are estimates for 2015 would be approximately $750 million in sales. As you know, that\u2019s less than what we saw in the last couple of years. And the other piece of it is I do think the execution this year at least as we see the pipeline right now are centered more around individual targeted asset sales as opposed to large scale joint ventures. Jamie Feldman : Okay, but I guess longer-term as you guys think about the, I mean you certainly have some core assets you have had in the company for a long time. Do you feel like you have kind of dug into or already done most of the transactions you would be willing to do and at this point the legacy assets will remain 100% owned? And what\u2019s the strategy behind, what\u2019s the thinking behind that? Owen Thomas : I think as we move forward beyond 2015, we\u2019ll have to evaluate one market conditions to our capital needs and what the best way to raise capital is. And I think we\u2019ll continue to have very selectively non-core assets that we want to sell from time to time. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then moving on to the future development pipeline, I know you had said you had cash on hand to finance the existing pipeline. How should we think about financing for future projects? Owen Thomas : Well, I mentioned approximately $1 billion of new developments that could be added this year. Mike talked a little bit about the restricted cash that we currently have on our balance sheet that could be made available. Certainly the $750 million of additional asset sales for this year, even net of tax gains would provide some additional proceeds to fund that development pipeline. In many of the developments, the larger developments that we\u2019re doing are developments that have a joint venture partner. So, as an example, 1001 in DC, we have a 50-50 partner with the Stewart family at North Station, we have a 50-50 partner with Delaware North. And that means that we will be getting construction loans which we haven\u2019t done on a number of our most recent financings for development projects we\u2019ve been using cash. And we already own the land in these ventures. So, when you look at what we actually have to raise from an equity perspective, it\u2019s a pretty small number if we finance 60% to 65% of these assets on a project secured financing basis. Jamie Feldman : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then finally, just focusing back on New York City, what are you guys seeing in terms of actual rent growth across the sub markets or at least the submarkets where you guys operate? Owen Thomas : John, I\u2019ll wager my own opinion and you can contradict if you want. We are seeing that in our development property at 250 West 55th Street we\u2019re actually hitting our pro forma. And that\u2019s a pro forma that we put in place in 2011. And we assume that the market would grow. In our existing assets, I think that the Plaza District asset it\u2019s very much a question of where it is in the building and what floor it\u2019s on. And we\u2019re trying to achieve the best rents we can for our shareholders and for the building. But then we\u2019re probably seeing 4% to 5% growth year-to-year in \u201cmarket rent\u201d assumptions might be from one building to another. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then finally, you had mentioned in New York some tenants there need additional space in your buildings. Is there a risk that you may lose some of those tenants if you don\u2019t have the expansion space? Owen Thomas : Well, the good news is most of these tenants are under relatively long-term leases. And so, to the extent that we can\u2019t accommodate their growth, they probably would need to sublet their space in to find satellite locations. We are, like we\u2019re pretty creative about finding space. And as I suggested, what we did down in Princeton where we basically took a tenant, who didn\u2019t have a lease to expire in for seven years and we figured out a way to relocate him and bring a new tenant in and then have them path to do that. We\u2019re going to do everything we can to accommodate the tenants that we have. Jamie Feldman : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Yours next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open. Alexander Goldfarb : Good morning, just a few questions here. First, can you just remind us what the triggers are for the Lehman estate to release the lease term fees? Just help us understand how that works? Mike LaBelle : Obviously it\u2019s up to the trustee and the bankruptcy court to approve these things. And they\u2019re trying, I think they\u2019re trying to when they have liquidity that is built up from selling assets, they try to distribute them as soon as they can. But they don\u2019t provide any kind of forecast or views on when it\u2019s going to be, how much it\u2019s going to be or anything like that. And I do want to point out that these are with a couple of notes on this, that we believe the value of the remaining claim is $5 million. Our claim is $33 million left based upon what they actually owed us. But the value is closer to $5 million. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay, so it almost sounds like you guys are sort of in line with a bunch of other creditors at sort of a similar level and as the estate - hurdles or whatever then all those creditors within a certain level are paid off, is that how it works? Mike LaBelle : Yes, I mean, they\u2019ll pay-off whatever they have. Obviously it\u2019s liquidating entirely, right. So, they\u2019re trying to liquidate the assets they have and they have to conserve money to pay for the cost to kind of the legal cost to manage the estate, the trustee cost, all of those costs over time. And when they feel they have excess liquidity, they make a distribution but I just don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be in \u201815 or if it\u2019s in going to be five years from now, we don\u2019t know. And there is still litigation out there with Barclays that has an impact on what we actually may get. So, it could be zero, we just don\u2019t know. Owen Thomas : We think there will be a long tail. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay, okay. And then, Ray, down at the - what used to be the K Street site, can you just talk a little bit about how the effort is in DC to try and get more of the tech tenants? And if it\u2019s more homegrown or if this is more, if you guys or the market sees more growth in lobbyists for the tech firms? Just a little bit more color on that part of the market. Ray Ritchey : Sure, Alex. The District of Columbia government is really trying to provide appropriate incentives to get homegrown tech tenants from Virginia down to downtown. And they have kind of made 1001 Sixth Street kind of the poster child for the tech tenants because of its geographic location and the quality of the building we are building and the nature of the building we have built. But we\u2019re not going to be confused with Palo Alto or Cambridge for sure. And so it is going to be a long struggle, but every tech tenant we bring by the site falls in love with the demographics of the site and falls in love with the building. So we\u2019re cautiously optimistic that if there will be a tech boom in DC, we\u2019re going to be leading the charge. The same thing is true with our Met Square building, the space we\u2019re getting back there we\u2019re specifically targeting tech tenants to come into that outstanding location with some of the best public spaces in the district. So we\u2019re just a two-pronged attack both Met Square and 1001 Sixth Street. Alexander Goldfarb : And Ray, are you optimistic that materially tech will increase this part of the tenancy or is it like, or do you or others in the market think that this is going to be a tough slot to try and get more tech to the DC market? Ray Ritchey : Well, it sort of reminds me of Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart demands all of its vendors to come to Bienville. The United States government is the largest consumer of tech services in the world. So I think the United States government needs to start demanding these tech tenants come to DC and lease basing us. But we\u2019re focusing on both home-grown and this summer working with Owen and Doug, we\u2019re going to do a outreach to many of the major tech tenants throughout the United States, alerting them not only of the availability of great tech opportunities in Reston and DC, but in all of our core markets. And we\u2019re going to take the show in the road to them to get them excited about coming not only to Cambridge or San Francisco but all other markets as well. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay, and then just finally, Owen, on the New York development I know that you don\u2019t want to really disclose anything, but can you at least let us know if it\u2019s Manhattan or Brooklyn, can you at least give us that color? Owen Thomas : Well, I\u2019ve said what I can say. But thank you for your interest. Alexander Goldfarb : Well then, we\u2019ll leave it to the news articles. Thank you. Owen Thomas : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee from Stifel. Your line is open. John Guinee : Great, okay, thank you very much. A couple quick questions, probably one for Ray and one for Doug. First, Ray, it seems to me the apartment business is a pretty good business as is the retail business. Talk about why you decided to sell the backside of 2200 Pennsylvania. I know there is ground lease, etcetera. And if you can also talk about pricing on that asset it would be great, maybe bifurcating on, a per unit and a per square-foot between the apartment and the retail? And then for, I think for Doug, you said something very interesting in that the bottom side of San Francisco has escalated up maybe 50% but the top side of the market is relatively flat. Can you talk about where your tenants are willing to pay without much pushback and then where the air gets very thin? For example, is the price where the tenants are willing to pay at Reston Town Center in the $40 to $45 range and then it gets thin after that, etcetera-etcetera.? Ray Ritchey : So, I\u2019ll take a shot at the Avenue first I guess. John, it\u2019s a great asset in a great location, and we\u2019re very proud of what we achieved there. But with a ground lease that is slowly ticking down that is hurtful both in terms of just the long-term ownership and also the REIT accounting coupled with the fact that it\u2019s a pretty management intensive apartment with a lot of student housing. We just felt coupled with the cap rates we\u2019re seeing for well located DC apartments we decided now the time is right. The allocation between the retail and the apartments themselves, hard to say how the buyer underwrote the respective cap rates of each, but there is no stronger retail in Washington than that ground floor. So I\u2019m sure they did, they\u2019re going to do very well there. Maybe Mike LaBelle could comment on the allocation on the price per units after the adjustment for the retail. But it was a great opportunity for us to harvest tremendous value on an asset that is not core to our presence here in DC. Doug Linde : And John, this is Doug. Basically look, we had a ground lease property that we found a buyer to purchase for just over 4% forward looking cash-on-cash return. And we looked at the DC market and the amount of property that was coming online in the greater DC area, on the rent side and felt that the rents were going to be pretty flat for the next few years. And so, we said, this is probably a place where we can better allocate our capital to other investments, aka the new development pipeline that we\u2019ve been talking about for the better part of two years. And so, it was a strategic decision that there was no synergy for us to hold on to that residential property in that particular location. With regard to your second question, I think that we can, you can leave space all day long in San Francisco at $73 to $75 a square-foot in high quality buildings across the city. And there is massive tenants who are prepared to pay that number. When you start acting $85 to $90 a square-foot, it becomes thinner and the size of those tenants become smaller. And the real question that we and that the market I think is asking is, as the supply picture gets worse and worse for the tenant, are the new development, new construction economics are going to start pushing that upper end to a point where those numbers become more aggressive from the landlord\u2019s perspective and easier to achieve. To date, almost all of the new construction that has occurred has been in that sort of high $60s to low $70s level. But given what people are now paying for ground, and the costs of construction going up on 4% to 6% range on annual basis. We believe that with that the timing is right for the top-end to by necessity start being able to achieve a wider growth of tenant looking on that space that we\u2019ll have to pay those numbers. Bob, I don\u2019t know if you have any other comments on that? Bob Pester : Yes, I would just add that San Francisco is cheap by comparison to other major cities where tech tenants are located such as London and Paris. And I think if you look at someone like a Salesforce for example, they\u2019re paying a lot more in London than they\u2019re paying here. And we continue to see these tenants pay up because they\u2019re not going to have a choice, there is just not going to be space for them to go to unless they pay the rate. John Guinee : Just a quick follow-up, Doug, that\u2019s great. Is there a, is that $73 to $75 number similar in New York City, Kendall Square, Back Bay of Boston, Washington DC, CBD or is it more or less? Doug Linde : It\u2019s different in every market John. I mean, in Kendall Square, I think that if you\u2019re looking for more than 25,000 or 30,000 square feet of space and you want to be in Kendall Square in particular, you\u2019re going to be paying somewhere in excess of $75 a square-foot with dollar bumps. But if you\u2019re in the financial district, you\u2019re not going to be paying more than $65 a square-foot. I mean, if you\u2019re in the low-rise of a building like 120 St. James, the number is probably close to $60 a square-foot. So there is a much wider growth in terms of the differentials. In Reston Virginia, the top-end of the market is $55 a square-foot. And I think the low-end of the market in our portfolio in Reston is I don\u2019t know, $46, $47 a square-foot, so it\u2019s a very, very tight range given the kind of property and the relative lack of differentiation between sort of being in the middle and the top of the building. And then in New York City, I mean, their tenants are going to pay over $200 a square-foot to be at the top of the General Motors building, 767 Fifth Avenue. And someone may pay somewhere in the low $70s to be in 540 Madison Avenue. So, again there is still a wide variety of where the rents are depending upon the building in a particular location. John Guinee : Great, thank you very much. John Powers : Yes, this is John. And obviously we count square-footage different in New York than they do anywhere in the country. So you can add a good premium on to the New York numbers. John Guinee : 20%? John Powers : That\u2019s a good number. John Guinee : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman from KeyBanc. Your line is open. Craig Mailman : Good morning, guys. Owen, maybe I could ask about, you talked about where we are in the cycle from asset values maybe later, but then you also said you guys are looking at additional land and redevelopment sites. So I\u2019m just curious kind of where you guys think we are in the valuations for land and vacancy relative to operating assets. And how you guys are looking at returns on some of these potential future sites you guys are working on? Owen Thomas : Well, in terms of the cycle, as I mentioned in my remarks, I think we do see the capital market cycle being more advanced than the property market cycle. And relating that now the property values, I do think that the values of buildings advanced sooner as, normal than land values. But that being said, land values are also rising around the country. And we are looking at many sites in our core markets, it\u2019s not easy today to find deals that completely pencil and we are being cautiously careful. I do think land probably to some extent does lag the building value, so we still see opportunity selectively. And I talked about the yields that we at least see in our current book and the developments that we intend to add this year, those being around 7% for on the office side and closer to 6% for the residential. Craig Mailman : Okay, that is helpful. Then maybe turning to San Francisco, I think we all know CBD is doing well and clearly some of the better markets down the peninsula. Just curious as you look in your portfolios, Zanker Road in Mountain View, still about 20% leased kind of what\u2019s the update there and the prospects? Owen Thomas : So, we are in active conversations with tenants on Zanker Road. The Silicon Valley is a pretty bifurcated market. So, what\u2019s going on in Mountain View and Palo Alto are different than what\u2019s going in North San Jose and in Santa Clara and to some degrees in Sunnyvale, where it\u2019s not quite as frothy. The rental rate differentiation is enormous, and you\u2019re talking about rents of $2.5 to $3 a square-foot for brand new property in North San Jose, Sunnyvale, Santa Clara and you\u2019re talking about $7 or $8 a square-foot for new property in downtown Mountain View and even more than in Palo Alto. So, again it\u2019s not as quite as frothy. I think what is happening is that the large tech tightens as we like to refer them and down the valley that the two largest have been Google and Apple have made a dramatic, dramatic impact on the availability of existing inventory and blocks of space. And so, things are getting more and more competitive. And that the users that we are seeing for Zanker Road are looking at it as a campus. And so, we\u2019ve been less interested in talking to tenants that are looking for 150,000 square feet because it\u2019s much more competitive there, but the tenants we\u2019re looking for a multi-building campus and we have the ability if someone is prepared to pay for it, to build additional buildings on Zanker Road, so we can increase the density from 550,000 square feet to in excess of 1 million square feet. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re targeting the demand. And I would say that there is an active conversation that\u2019s going on with those buildings on a continual basis. But we have not truthfully gotten anyone to say yes to what our economic desires are. And we\u2019ve been the bridesmaid a couple of times with some of these larger requirements as well. But the market clearly has improved and I would say we feel better today about our chances than we did 12 months ago. Craig Mailman : Is this a candidate at some point - I know a lot of users have been buying up assets down there. Is this a candidate for that or for one reason or another it is better to lease for you guys? Owen Thomas : We would prefer to lease, the business that we\u2019re in is the lease space. But we have been approached by users about either options to purchase or outright purchase decisions as opposed to these decisions. And we have encouraged them to tell us what they want to do and that we will respond to them regardless of what their requirement was. Craig Mailman : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick from Capital One Securities. Your line is open. Tom Lesnick : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I\u2019ll be brief since most of them have already been answered. But just touching on 901 New York real quick, was that promote already assumed in your first-quarter guidance? And what, if any, other promotes are coming up in the next few years? Mike LaBelle : That was assumed in our guidance. And we do not have expectations for any other significant events like that in our portfolio. We don\u2019t have a lot of these JVs that have kind of promote features in them. This was more of a unique situation that occurred. And I would call, kind of a one-time event that affected our earnings and our FFO this quarter. And the future run-rate on 901 New York Avenue will likely go back to closer to what it was in the prior quarter. Tom Lesnick : Okay, thanks for the clarification. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Maiorana from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Brendan Maiorana : Thanks, good morning. In San Francisco, I think you guys have stated this and some other landlords have as well, one thing to look out for is maybe some sublet space that would come back to the market. And there has been some sublet space that has come back to the market in the first quarter, albeit from very low levels prior to that. But is that anything to look out for in terms of maybe some users or some of the velocity in the market slowing down or some of the users that were looking to take on aggressive levels and space maybe slowing down a bit at the margin? Owen Thomas : I\u2019ll make a brief comment and then I\u2019ll let Bob Pester give some color on it. So, the only major block of sublease space that we\u2019re aware of that impact of the market was 200,000 square feet of 555 Market Street which was on Omnicon sublease and as soon as Omnicon got out of it, Uber took the entire block of space. And every other major large block of space that we\u2019re aware of has got scooped up. However, there are a lot of technology companies and private equities funded entrepreneurial organizations that don\u2019t work and they don\u2019t make it. And that there, so there is a lots of churn that goes on in a market like San Francisco. But again, it\u2019s at the sort of smaller size range, it\u2019s the 20,000 to 30,000 square feet. But I\u2019ll let Bob provide more color on that. Bob Pester : Yes. I would use the example of 680 Folsom where we had slack and about 11,000 square feet. They just expanded in are taking 40,000 square feet and now they\u2019re building and that space has been on the market less than 30 days and it\u2019s already been taken by another tenant. Salesforce has some space available at 1 California and 123 Mission. And when we were with Ford at Salesforce the other day, he said they have a great activity on that. So, when you take the total amount of square-footage that\u2019s available on sublease which is about 650,000 to 675,000 square feet. It\u2019s really just a blip down in the market. Brendan Maiorana : Okay, great, that\u2019s helpful. And then just, Owen, point of clarification. I think you mentioned all the development projects and then the projects which could come into the development pipeline this year, the $1 billion or so depending on how those break down. Is the yield on the future development projects is that also 7% for office and 6% for retail? Or was the blend 6% on kind of everything that would come into the pipeline this year on the newer projects? Owen Thomas : Yes, we continue to target 7% for office and 6% for the residential for the pre-development projects that we would bring into the development pipeline in 2015. Doug Linde : And just to clarify, because I think different organizations talk about this differently. When we provide you a number like that, we\u2019re including a fully baked asset with a return on capital equity and debt included in that return - in that budget. So to the extent that someone else is doing this without a cost of capital associated with it and a number of different, we have a cost of capital on our debt and our equity. Brendan Maiorana : Okay, great. Thanks for the clarification. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson from Mizuho Securities. Your line is open. Rich Anderson : Sorry to keep things going. Just quickly, Doug, you mentioned a lot of different stuff in your opening remarks. And I\u2019m curious if you said not to request 2016 guidance, but when you think about CapEx and downtime and free rent and rent roll up and all that goes into that recipe, do you think that the rent recognition kind of really plays a meaningful role next year? Is it more of a 2017 event in your mind when you think of it all together? Doug Linde : You mean, are you saying the ramp-up in our occupancy? Rich Anderson : Yes, like Hancock and GM and everything that\u2019s going on, I\u2019m just trying to kind of aggregate the impact to your cash flow to a better degree. And it sounded like in the case of Hancock it\u2019s a back half of 2016 rent recognition. I\u2019m just wondering if that is kind of par for the course for the entire process and you think it\u2019s more of a 2017 event where you really see the fruits of your labor? Doug Linde : So, let me give you an example. So, the 145,000 square feet of deals that we\u2019re talking at 250 West 55th Street, I would expect if knock on wood, things go well most of those leases are going to get signed in the second quarter of 2015. We will not have rent recognition on most of those leases until the back half of 2016 because when you do a 10 or 15-year lease in New York City, you\u2019re giving somebody 12-months a build-out time. And in particular, when you\u2019re doing it on first generation space, there is no such thing as straight line rent, right. So, we\u2019re not delivering this space tomorrow and then saying, we\u2019re going to start rent recognition day one, we\u2019re actually having to wait until the tenant actually has taken the space, built out that space and are in occupancy effectively. So there is a lag associated with all of these things that we\u2019re talking about which is sort of my point in my comments. So, as an example, when we take a space back to for the build-out of the law-firm installations that are going on at 599, that floor is effectively occupied but there is no rent recognition on it until we\u2019re done with that and we won\u2019t get done with that build-out until the end of \u201816. So, there is a lot of stuff like that that\u2019s going on within the portfolio but you just have to sort of recognize as your thinking about your projections on a going forward basis. Rich Anderson : Okay, great. And then if you can quickly just rattle off for me, you mentioned 4% to 5% market rent growth in New York. What would that be for San Francisco, Boston, Cambridge, DC, Reston, do you have that just like a quick number for each of those? Doug Linde : I would tell you that rental rates in Cambridge are probably up 15% year-over-year. I would say rents in suburban Boston are probably up in high single-digits. Rents in the financial district of Boston are pretty flat. But rents in the Back Bay of Boston are probably up 7% to 10%. And there is a premium associated with the high-end space in the Back Bay. In Reston, I think things are locked up to 2% to 3% maybe, and in the district they\u2019re very flat. And out in San Francisco we\u2019ve probably seen somewhere close to 10% to 12% increases year-over-year in our rental rate assumptions overall, although again it\u2019s been higher at the low end of buildings and less at the high-end of buildings. Rich Anderson : Perfect, thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Vance Edelson : Thanks, good morning. On the Salesforce.com tower, I know a variety of floor designs are possible, but bigger picture, just given the lack of large blocks available in the financial district and beyond, do you envision tenants taking multiple 25,000 square-foot floors and connecting them via staircase? Would that be your preference to rent more in bulk or do you picture more single floor or even partial floor tenants filling the rest of the building? Owen Thomas : Bob, you want to take that one? Bob Pester : Yes, well, first off there is already three stairwells on each floor connecting the various floors, so it\u2019s doubtful someone would add an additional stairwell. We\u2019ve got a variety of users that we\u2019ve been making presentations to, tech tenants, financial tenants and law-firms. So I would see a combination of single floor tenants and then some much larger users as well. Obviously, if someone like a Google came along and wanted a big block of space for 400,000 to 500,000 square feet, we do that type of transaction we are talking to single floor tenants right now as well. Vance Edelson : Okay, got it. And then sticking with Salesforce, are you getting any clarity on rents per square-foot as you speak with prospective tenants? There are some buildings just a matter of blocks away that are already asking $100 a square-foot for the best floors. You\u2019ve got the preeminent new construction with the views and the connection to Trans Bay. Is it realistic that we\u2019ll be hearing about triple-digit rents? Bob Pester : Well, we\u2019re not asking triple-digit rents on our floors right now. But I think as far as rents in the high $80s to low $90s on a net basis, are realistic. Vance Edelson : Okay, fair enough. And then on the FAO Schwarz space, just given the relatively large size, has any thought been given to whether that could be split up for multiple tenants or does it have to be a single tenant given the relatively limited frontage facing Fifth? Owen Thomas : John? John Powers : It clearly doesn\u2019t have to be one tenant. It would be unique opportunity for single tenants that could use that much space. But we have a number of scenarios that we\u2019re looking at as to how to divide that up with Fifth Avenue with on the street are also likely to. So, there is a number of possibilities with the upstairs, with the downstairs, with the main floor, really lots of flexibility in how we do that. Vance Edelson : Okay, perfect. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citigroup. Your line is open. Manny Korchman : Hey, guys, Manny Korchman here. We\u2019ve been hearing a little bit of construction delays at Salesforce due to sort of the ground being softer than you expected. Is there any truth to those rumors? Owen Thomas : My comment in my prepared remarks was that our spend is up, and our spend is up because we\u2019re spending more time in the foundation work and in the shearing and the shoring. And we have yet to start the major concrete and seal work. Our expectation is that the building will be open for Salesforce with the TCO in the first quarter of 2017 or end of the first quarter of 2017. And that our spend is going to pick up and so this year we\u2019re going to spend less and we\u2019ll spend more in 2016. Manny Korchman : Great, thanks. Operator : At this time I would like to turn the call back to management for any additional remarks. Owen Thomas : I think that concludes our remarks. Thank you very much for your interest and attention. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s Boston Properties Conference Call. Thank you again for attending and have a great day.",

During the question-and-answer portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, our Executive Vice President of Acquisitions and Development and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks. Owen Thomas : Thank you, Arista. Good morning, everyone. As we have done in prior quarters, I will provide an update on how we're viewing the economy and its impacts on our business, our resultant capital allocation approach and progress and some high-level remarks on the quarter. Doug will then provide an overview of our operations followed by Mike who will wrap up with a more detailed financial summary of the quarter. In particular this morning we intend to highlight specific investment decisions we have made and the resultant tenant activity which will have an impact on our 2016 and 2017 results. So starting with the environment, economic performance in the U.S. continues to unfold the way we have described in previous quarters. Economic growth is steady but modest as first-quarter U.S. GDP declined 0.2% but is forecast to be a positive 2.4% for all of 2015. Unemployment has dropped to 5.3% at the end of June but the underemployment rate remains stubbornly high at a little over 11%. Economic growth has translated into office net absorption for the second quarter in the U.S. of approximately 15 million square feet and 1.1% of stock for the last year. Technology and life sciences driven markets continue to lead the pack in terms of positive absorption. Office construction continues to increase as well with 2.1% of current stock under construction versus a long term average of 1.9%. The capital market landscape has remained fairly benign as well. The 10-year U.S. Treasury rate has risen approximately 30 basis points since our last call but remains at a historically low level of 2.3%. We and market consensus continue to expect the Fed to increase rates later this year which has stoked cap rate expansion fears and driven capital flows out of REITs, $4.8 billion from U.S. mutual funds and ETFs so far this year with a resultant negative impact on share price performance for Boston Properties and the entire sector. REIT valuation declines are not consistent with the current private market for real estate assets where investor enthusiasm remains robust. We continue to see positive rent growth, a significant yield gap and the potential for an appreciating dollar attracting both domestic and non-U.S. investors to high quality office assets in our core markets. Aggressive asset pricing including for our own sales continue to exist in our core markets. So in summary on the environment, we continue to believe capital values are more advanced in the cycle than underlying fundamentals and see more upside driven by operating fundamentals and further cap rate compression. So logically we're more actively investing in our capital and new developments rather than existing acquisitions. Further, we're taking advantage of private market pricing by funding development activity through targeted asset sales. Now moving to the specifics on our capital strategy execution for the quarter, we continue to be active at measured in the pursuit of acquisitions. We're focused on sites and redevelopments in our core markets and though pricing is a challenge, we're having some success as demonstrated by the new investments which I will describe in a moment. We're also looking at acquisitions of high quality existing buildings in partnership with private capital providers given the opportunity to enhance our returns through compensation earned for providing real estate skills to targeted assets. On dispositions, we announced this week that a contract has been executed for the sale of 505 9th St. in the Washington DC CBD. This 325,000 square foot Class A building was broadly marketed globally and is under contract with a domestic investor for $318 million which represents pricing of $977 per square foot and a 4.4% forward NOI cap rate. The buyer is assuming $117 million of above market debt which when factored into the valuation, brings the price to in excess of $1000 per square foot and an even lower effective yield. Boston Properties owns 50% of the building and generated a 16% unleveraged and a 30% leveraged return on the development for shareholders. We're also continuing to reduce our Montgomery County, Maryland activities with a second land parcels sale expected in the third quarter at Washingtonian North for $13 million. With these sales plus the already completed sale of The Avenue in Washington DC, we will have completed or contracted for total dispositions of $377 million measured as our share and remain on track for targeted total dispositions of $750 million for 2015. As mentioned, we continue to emphasize development for our new investment activities given the opportunity we see to recycle capital from the sale of our older buildings into new projects with higher returns. We were able to launch three new development projects in the second quarter. The most significant new development we recently announced is Dock 72, a 670,000 square foot, 16-story building located in the Brooklyn Navy Yard in a 50% partnership with Rudin Management. The building is 33% preleased to WeWork for 20 years, will cost $410 million to develop and is scheduled for delivery in the first half of 2018. The land is leased from the Brooklyn Navy Yard for 96 years with modest levels of ground rent and given the land is owned by the City of New York, all tenants are exempt from real estate taxes and sales tax on leasehold improvements. Further, tenants located in Brooklyn are exempt from commercial occupancy tax and can qualify for business relocation benefits. With these incentives, we can lease the balance of the building at around $60 a square foot and achieve an unleveraged initial NOI yield in access of our target of 7% for office developments. Boston Properties will manage and be paid development fees for the construction of the building and we will jointly lease and manage the property post completion with Rudin Management. Through this investment, we will be expanding our business to an exciting new district in New York City of great interest to technology and creative tenants and expanding our relationship with WeWork, one of the fastest-growing office tenants in the United States. Further, we think the Dock 72 investment could lead to additional development opportunities for Boston Properties at the Brooklyn Navy Yard and in Brooklyn more broadly. This past quarter we also announced the development of 1265 Main Street in Waltham, Massachusetts in a 50% partnership with the current owner of this former Polaroid site. 1265 Main is a three-story, 115,000 square foot building that will undergo a complete redevelopment at a cost of $52 million including site acquisition. The development is 100% preleased to Clark Shoes and is forecast to generate in excess of a 7% unleveraged NOI yield on cost were delivered in the fourth quarter of 2016. Though these size of the 1265 Main Street development is modest for us, the investment secures our opportunity to develop up to an additional 1 million square feet of commercial space on a site immediately to the south and adjacent to our CityPoint portfolio. Boston Properties will now effectively control 90% of the East Route 128 frontage between exits 26 and 27 with opportunities to create transit connections between the new development and our existing Waltham assets. Lastly, we're redeveloping Reservoir Place North, a 35-year-old, 73,000 square foot building we own adjacent to Reservoir Place in Waltham which was vacated earlier this year. We expect to generate in excess of a 7% unlevered NOI return on the $25 million of incremental costs required to convert the building to a Class A facility. Reservoir Place North is an example of existing portfolio investment opportunities that exist for us in strengthening markets such as Waltham. With these three new projects, our active development pipeline now consists of 14 projects representing 4.2 million square feet with our share of total projected cost of $2.4 billion. We forecast these projects, currently 59% preleased, will generate over a 7% cash NOI yield upon completion over the next four plus years and we have all the capital required to complete these developments with $1.3 billion in unrestricted cash currently on our balance sheet. We have now commenced $486 million on a gross basis of new projects for 2015 and continue to target $1 billion in new starts for the year. As described in the past, we have a large number of projects in our pre-development pipeline which could still be launched in 2015 including the first and podium phase of North Station consisting of 360,000 square feet of retail and loft space located adjacent to the TD Garden in Boston, a 160,000 square foot residential development located in our Kendall Center project in Cambridge, a 600,000 square foot residential and retail development located in our Reston Town Center project, three different potential office build-to-suit opportunities in the Washington DC region representing in the aggregate over 1.3 million square feet, as well as significant improvement projects at 601 Lexington Avenue in New York and 100 Federal Street in Boston, both of which will enhance and add high value retail amenities to the building. The next wave of development will include a significant allocation to multifamily projects where we anticipate the initial yields to be closer to 6% than the 7% initial cash NOI yield we have been able to achieve on our office projects. Moving to results for the second quarter, we continue to perform well and as I described earlier, we have made strong progress towards executing our goals. As you know, our diluted FFO for the first quarter was $1.36 per share which is above our forecast and consensus. We're also increasing our full year guidance and Mike will take you through those details. We had an active quarter in leasing having completed 88 deals representing 1 million square feet with balance across all of our four major markets. And the occupancy of our in-service properties increased to 91.1% from 90.3%. So let me turn over the discussion to Doug for a review of our operations. Doug Linde : Thanks, Owen. Good morning everybody. My commentary on the general market conditions in our four core markets is going to sound really pretty consistent with what we have described in the last few quarters. Boston, both the suburbs, the city and Cambridge, New York City, San Francisco they are all really healthy markets and they are all characterized by strong demand coming from new economy companies although there seems to be more and more [indiscernible] type users as well accompanied by stable supply characteristics and it is all resulting in improving real estate economics which I think are flowing through our numbers as you saw in our second-generation statistics this quarter. And then DC CBD continues to work through its densification issues in the relatively modest amount of new demand generators there and then Northern Virginia really continues to be a story of both strong and weak markets. The good news is we predominantly are in the strongest markets. As I discussed the operating portfolio this quarter, I think I'm going to spend some time providing some specific expectations on sort of some of the larger moving parts in the portfolio, the major vacancy upcoming rollover and discuss some of a pretty meaningful property-specific investment and leasing decisions that we're making right now all with the goal of foreshadowing our 2016 same-store portfolio. I hope this is going to provide a pretty good backdrop to the earnings guidance that Mike is going to provide for 2016 in October. Our overall leasing activity in the second quarter dropped off a little bit from the first quarter but was really pretty much in line with the average that we have been hitting for each second quarter for the last 10 years which is about 1 million square feet. Again, the second-generation leasing stats were dominated by Boston and San Francisco. I think they are probably a little bit higher than you might have expected in Boston, up 30% on a net basis and that is really stemming from the impact that we're starting to see as the lease at 200 Clarendon Street which was formerly referred to as the Hancock Tower but we're not allowed to call it that in a longer since the Hancoc's lease expired at the beginning of the second quarter. As well as there was lease commencement at 101 Huntington Ave. with Blue Cross Blue Shield which was over 300,000 square feet which had a big pop as well. In San Francisco as you saw, we're up 41% while the contributions from Embarcadero Center specifically was up over 60%. Statistically New York City was pretty limited, there was only 36,000 square feet in total and about half of that was from Princeton. Then in DC, we had pretty strong rollup in Reston and then really flat results in the CBD and our other markets. I'm going to begin my specific market comments this morning on Midtown Manhattan. So it really continues to be a very healthy market, solid leasing activity but as we have said in the past with 10% availability and lots of uncommitted new construction, rental rate increases have been pretty modest, really moderated. We're seeing heavy traffic across our entire portfolio but if you look at our occupancy statistics, we have very limited current availability so most of our negotiations are revolving around future availability. The one exception to this is obviously at 250 W. 55th Street where this quarter we completed eight more leases ranging from 4000 square feet prebuilt suites to a floor and half square foot lease. We're 89% leased, we have two prebuilt suites and three full floors in the top quarter of the building to go. Our asking rents are from the low $90s to well over $100 a square foot for those full floors remaining at the top of the building. At 599 Lexington, in order to speed up the rebuilding process from the tenants that we renewed last year, we have three non-revenue producing swing floors that are all currently occupied but will be unavailable for revenue until the end of 2016. We have leases under negotiation on two of those floors and activity on the third. At 399 Park, there are two major lease expirations in 2017, 190,000 square foot block in the midrise, this if you recall is adjacent to 150,000 square foot block that we got back in 2016 and we released to four separate tenants in six months the entire block. There we have expiring rents of about $100 a square foot and we expect to get rents well over that. And then we have the Citi space at 399 which is really in the three blocks. We have a 280,000 square foot block at the base, 97,000 square feet in the midrise and about 110,000 square feet below grade. The above grade space has a current rent of about $90 a square foot and we expect to be pretty close to that and discussions are already underway with more than 300,000 square feet of that 2017 rollover. At 601 Lexington Avenue, we announced a few quarters ago that Citi would be terminating its lease on about 170,000 square feet in April of 2016. Three of those floors were in the Tower and two of those floors were in the low rise building which is floors three through six. We have now leased the entire Tower block, 90,000 square feet, though rent is not going to commence on 60,000 square feet until 2017 and we're in the planning stages of a major repositioning of the retail and the low rise of 601 which I think we introduced at our investor meeting a year ago and we're working on a plan to vacate the entire 140,000 square foot office building including the 70,000 square feet that is under long term lease to the Citi. This would result in additional 2016 and 2017 vacancy as we renovate this portion of the complex. With virtually no vacancy at 601, what our New York team is doing right now is trying to find ways where we can actually control currently leased space so we can move tenants around and move forward with these plans. This is very high contribution space and it is going to result in a diminution of our 2016 occupancy and revenue. But consistent with our core strategy and philosophy, we're making decisions with a long term view of maximizing the value of individual assets in the portfolio and this is the opportune time to take advantage of what we can do at 601. Last quarter, we commented on the possible early termination of FAO. This will occur on August 1 as part of an agreement we reached with an existing tenant to use the FAO space on a temporary basis as they reconfigure their existing operations. As we look forward to 2016, the net contribution from this space will be suboptimal. We made the decision to accelerate the lease expiration and forfeit a portion of FAO's rent for 2016 in order to accommodate this tenant's requirement and set up the GM retail for even stronger future performance. The FAO space is over 60,000 square feet, 14,000 square feet on the ground floor, 34,000 square feet on the second floor with 20 foot ceiling heights and 11,000 square feet of Concourse space. This city block has among the highest pedestrian traffic counts on Fifth Avenue and historically the FAO foot fall has nearly matches that of the Apple Store. The FAO space will go through a major renovation and downtime as part of any releasing which will likely occur in 2017 and we will greatly increase the contribution thereafter. Switching to DC, so this quarter I think the headline news from all the brokers reports was that the DC had positive absorption after a number of quarters of negative activity and while this is certainly a positive change, the District continues to be very competitive since there hasn't been much in the way of significant demand increases and in fact the real interesting overhang today revolves actually around the massive amount of GSA related expirations. Nearly half of all leased GSA space in the Metro area rolls between 2015 and 2017 and the GSA has mandated densification. How is this really going to work? It is really one thing to require on paper an agency to reduce its space per employee by 10% or 20% or in some cases 40% which is what they mandated, but with specialized uses in many installations and the capital requirements necessary to build space or move tenants, we will really see what actually happens. The one wholly-owned building in our portfolio with a near-term major law firm expiration is at 1330 Connecticut Avenue and we're actively engaged in lease extension negotiations there. Our development that 601 Mass is on schedule. It is actually going to open up early, likely in September and the office space is 83% leased. The income contribution will ramp up significantly in 2016. In the rest of our portfolio as Ray is prone to say, we're in hand-to-hand on the availability at our JV assets that Market Square North and it 901 New York Avenue and at Met Square where we may be losing some occupancy in 2016 but we will gain it back. Reston Town Center continues to be the best-performing market in our region as well as in Northern Virginia. It has a vacancy rate under 3% while the overall Reston marketplace is over 14%. Roslyn is at over 30% and Tyson is at 18. During the first quarter, we negotiated the recapture of 55,000 square feet of our Overlook property in order to provide expansion to a growing tenant. This quarter we gained control of an additional 55,000 square feet and that same tenant grabbed it again on a long term basis.  The combination of walkable retail, high quality new multifamily, community programming and improving access to Metro continue to draw tenants to the Town Center. Small tenant demand is strong, we did eight more renewals and expansions this quarter and many of our smaller tenants are now expanding. Switching to the Boston market, lack of available supply continues to be the story in Cambridge. Every week there seems to be another article describing a Cambridge company with growth requirements that is unable to find space in Kendall Square. The question is how is this trend going to impact other markets? Well these companies are migrating to the back bay, to downtown, to the seaport and in some cases to the suburbs. But in any case, Kendall Square continues to dramatically outperform the rest of the urban Boston market with rents above $70 a square foot. Our Cambridge portfolio as we have said before is essentially 100% leased and we don't have any short-term availability but there are a large number of expansion requirements in the market. We're working with the city of an upzoning of our Kendall Square project to add 600,000 square feet of office density and about 400,000 square feet of multifamily. This filing is likely to occur sometime this summer. The GSA recently issued its plan outlining the timing for the disposal of the Volpe transportation site and it now suggests an award in early 2017 which means no additional supply from this site for four to five years. One note of importance as you think about our portfolio in Cambridge on a going forward basis is to remember that we previously announced that MIT has exercised the fixed-price option that we negotiated in 2002 to purchase 7 Cambridge Center. It is going to occur on February 1 and it is going to result in the reduction of about $13.3 million in 2016 comparable to 2015. In the Back Bay, our repositioning and our rebranding at 120 St. James where we have 170,000 square feet of availability was completed last week and we had our first formal presentation and I think the reaction was fabulous. Our asking rents on this space are significantly lower than in Cambridge, they are 40% higher than our original underwriting in 2011 and the mark to market that we expect to get on this space is 60% higher than the expiring rent. The 150,000 square foot block at the top of the Hancock Tower is still under lease until the middle of the summer. While it is certainly available to show, it is really not in very good shape and it probably won't be until the end of the year. Realistically we're not likely to see rent commencement on these two big blocks until the very end of 2016 or early 2017. I think we will do some leasing in 2016, we may even do some leasing in 2015 but from a rent commencement perspective, not likely until 2016 or 2017. The incremental contribution from the available space of this building is going to be over $25 million. Similar to New York City, the occupancy has a much higher contribution than our average current weighted rent of about $55 a square foot across the portfolio. At 888 Boylston Street, we signed another full floor least. We're now 258,000 square foot leased for 71% of this office building which isn't going to deliver until the fourth quarter of 2016. We're having extensive conversations with retailers for the 65,000 square feet of space at 888 and are negotiating our first major lease there and we have completed leasings on the entire flagship expansion, that 33,000 square feet two-story that we added on top of legal and Sephora were and Eatay begins their work soon and we expect them to open in the third quarter of 2016. Big exciting things are about to happen at the Prudential Center. At 100 Federal Street, we're in active discussions with two tenants to restack and relocate within the building in order to accommodate a major lease with a new tenant coming in. These transactions involve more than 1 million square feet of leasing on a long term basis in the building and take up all of the currently vacant space. The sequencing of these moves and the delivery of the space will result in revenue recognition on the available space to be delayed until 2016 or early 2017. In fact, in order to complete the deal we actually had to take a floor back from a tenant this month which will add to the short-term availability at 100 Fed. At the risk of repeating myself, we're making decisions with a long term of view maximizing the value of the individual assets in the portfolio and we're sacrificing short-term FFO. The Seaport has seen its first speculative construction so now Boston has a 400,000 square foot spec building being developed this quarter and there is purportedly another 370,000 square feet coming after that. Moving out to the suburbs, the Waltham Metro West market continues to get stronger driven by expansion by shoe companies, life science and tech companies. While there are tenants that are relocating to urban locations, there continues to be significant organic growth in the Route 128 Lexington-Waltham market. This quarter we did 15 leases in our suburban portfolio. We're now in lease negotiations for all of the remaining space at our development at 10 CityPoint and we expect to achieve rents in excess of $50 a square foot for this new project which will deliver in mid-2016. This is a 25% increase over the last 18 months. While there is no speculative construction currently underway as Owen mentioned given the health of the market, we made the decision to take one of our vintage buildings, Reservoir Place North which was built in 1981, out of service and we're completing a complete gut rehab, new skin, new core locations and it will allow for tenant occupancy at the end of 2016.  Again instead of doing a short-term deal at a lower rent, we decided to push the building, increase the rents to where we believe we will be in the mid-40s which will be significant upgrade over the then expiring rent which occurred this May in the low 30s. During the majority of our conversations at the June NAREIT meetings, there was a focus on demand in San Francisco and whether we were seeing signs of concern. Our answer was and continues to be no, we're not. The leasing activity continues to be healthy. During the first half of 2015, Uber, FitBit, DocuSign, Lending Club, Stripe, all took blocks in excess of 100,000 square feet and last night there was a report in the paper that Apple, Apple the computer company from the Valley, completed their first lease South of Market in the city. Where there has been sublet space, it has been in small pockets and it has leased for strong rents. In fact we're getting sublet profit on two sublets at 680 Folsom. Down in the Valley, Apple, Palo Alto Networks, LinkedIn, Aruba, Nutanix, Broadcom, have all looking for and committed to large new expansions. At Embarcadero Center, we completed another 112,000 square feet of office leasing during the quarter. The largest deal was 75,000 square feet, the mark to market was over 50% on a gross basis and over 70% on a net basis. None of these transactions are in the same-store statistics for the quarter. We're actively engaged with additional full floor tenants with 16 and 17 expirations in total. We have about 1 million square feet of lease expirations with an average rent of $53 a square foot at Embarcadero Center in 2016 and 2017. There are significant opportunities for rental increases in all these transactions and we continue to complete more transactions with an $80 starting rent. Down in Mountainview, the lack of available supply has led to large jumps in market rents. A year ago we were making proposals of about $40 triple net on our single-story R&D. Today proposals are going out over $48 a square foot for this product. And in North San Jose at Zanker Road -- knock on wood -- we have a number of active building prospects including a user that is interested in all of the existing assets as well as the potential to expand the project by up to 500,000 square feet. The one hole the portfolio if you will is at Gateway where we expect Genentech to vacate between 185,000 square feet and 285,000 square feet in early 2016. The good news here is that the CalTrain system is in the process of dramatically upgrading their South San Francisco station which is the first stop out of the city and a short walk to the property. So we're encouraged about the location more so today than we have been in the past. At 535 Mission, we have completed additional leasing bringing our lease space to over 249,000 square feet and we have another lease out that gets us to 258,000 or 84% leased. That is nine months after we open the building. Our asking rents are in the low 80s. And Salesforce Tower, our marketing team continues to actively market the building as we get closer to those lease expiration driven opportunities that we have been discussing previously. There is a continuous flow of users that have expressed an interest in the building and over the last quarter, we have had an additional 12 showings similar to the quarter before with users in excess of 50,000 square feet and we now have active proposals outstanding with two users for between three and four floors that are in negotiation. With that I will stop and I will turn it over to Mike. Mike LaBelle : Great, thanks, Doug. Before I get into our earnings and our projections, I just want to spend a minute on our balance sheet. We continue to have strong liquidity. We have $1.3 billion of cash. Owen covered that our development pipeline has grown, it has grown to $2.4 billion with about $1.3 billion remaining to fund so we continue to have all of the capital raised to fund our current pipeline. Additionally over the last couple of years, we have utilized a portion of the cash raised from our asset sales to pay down debt. We're currently operating at a net debt to EBITDA that is now in the mid-5s. This is significantly below our more typical run rate in the 6.5 to 7 range and provides us with enhanced flexibility to fund additional investments with debt. The combination of debt repayment and the delivery of higher-yielding developments funded partially with asset sales has resulted in lower balance sheet leverage and that is despite paying out nearly $1.2 billion in special dividends in the past two years. We've also been focused on our future debt maturities and we have engaged in an interest-rate hedging program to lock in the current interest rate environment. So far we have hedged $550 million of forward starting 10 year swaps targeting the refinancing of our $750 million mortgage on 599 Lexington Avenue which is prepayable at par in September of 2016 and our $1.6 billion mortgage on the GM building that can be prepaid at par in June of 2017. We have an additional $1.2 billion of mortgages expiring that we currently forecast refinancing in late 2016 and early 2017. We continue to monitor opportunities to accelerate this financing which could occur earlier in 2016 or even in late 2015 and could result in a one-time charge for a prepayment premium. The bond market has endured some rate and spread volatility in the past 30 to 60 days from global events, but debt issuances continue to go well, be well received, in both the public and the private markets. And we believe our borrowing costs today for 10 years is attractive and below 4%. So turning to our earnings for the quarter, we reported funds from operations of $1.36 per share. That was $0.03 per share or $4 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. The majority of the earnings beat came from lower than expected operating expenses in the portfolio, primarily due to utilities and repair and maintenance expense. We do expect approximately $2 million of the repair and maintenance items to occur in the second half of the year. So in reality, the second quarter benefit to our full year guidance from expense savings is only a penny. We reported termination income of $5.4 million which after accounting for non-controlling interest was about $1 million above our budget. The largest piece of this was $3.8 million related to the acceleration of fair value rental income for FAO Schwartz. Since this lease was below market when we acquired the building, we have been amortizing into our income non-cash fair value rental income that we accelerated upon termination of the lease. As Doug mentioned, we will have a temporary tenant in place at FAO for a little over a year before we can capture the upside of leasing this space at market. After adjusting for pushing a portion of our second quarter expense savings into the rest of 2015, the benefit from the second quarter results is less than $0.02 per share to our full year projections. As Owen mentioned, we have our 505 9th Street property under contract for sale. We anticipate a closing in September and the future lost income is approximately a penny per share to 2015. Our portfolio occupancy improved 80 basis points this quarter to 91.1%, with the occupancy of Blue Cross Blue Shield in 300,000 square feet at 101 Huntington Avenue in Boston, increases at Bay Colony and Waltham at Embarcadero Center in San Francisco and the continued lease up 250 W. 55th Street in New York City. We expect our occupancy to be relatively stable for the remainder of the year. As we have described throughout the year, our same property portfolio performance in 2015 has been impacted by the increasing vacancy in Boston at the Hancock Tower. As Doug also mentioned, we have made a number of operating decisions that will limit our revenue and occupancy in 2016 but that we believe will enhance our long term performance. This quarter we terminated our lease with FAO. It had a modest impact on our GAAP results for 2015 but it will lower our cash income for the rest of the year. And we terminated a lease at 100 Federal Street which also had an impact. On the positive side, we continue to be active at Embarcadero Center signing early lease renewals and locking in rental rate increases. This quarter we signed 77,000 square feet of renewals for tenants that expire in 2016 where we will start straight lining the rental increases this year. As a result of these facts, we now project 2015 same property NOI to be negative 0.5% to positive 0.5% from 2014. That is no change from last quarter. However cash same property NOI is projected to be negative 0.5% to positive 0.25% from 2014 which is a reduction from last quarter. The projected NOI from our development properties is consistent with our guidance last quarter. The properties that are not on the same property portfolio include The Avant, 250 W. 55th Street, 680 Folsom St., 535 Mission St., 99 3rd Avenue, and 601 Mass Avenue and are projected to add an incremental $54 million to $60 million to our 2015 NOI. Our non-cash straight line and fair value lease revenue is projected to be $84 million to $92 million for the full year 2015. That includes only our share of our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. There is approximately $50 million of free rent in these numbers that will burn off during 2015 and 2016, much of which is in our recently completed developments. Our 2015 hotel NOI is projected to be in line with last quarter's guidance of $12 million to $14 million. Our development and management services income is tracking as expected. It is projected to be $18 million to $22 million in 2015. We project our net interest expense to be $422 million to $431 million for the year. Our development spend is meeting our current projections resulting in capitalized interest for 2015 of $31 million to $38 million. Our forecast for non-controlling interest in property partnerships is unchanged from last quarter and for the full year we project a deduction to FFO of $135 million to $145 million. So our guidance for 2015 funds from operations is now $5.37 to $5.45 per share, that is an increase of $0.01 per share at the midpoint compared to our guidance last quarter. If you exclude the impact of the expected sale at 505 9th Street, we would have been raising our guidance by $0.02 per share from better projected portfolio operations and higher termination income. In the third quarter 2015, we project funds from operations of $1.34 to $1.36 per share. Owen mentioned the potential for additional asset sales in 2015 and other than the pending sale at 505 9th Street, we have not included any additional asset sales in our updated guidance. Although we will not provide formal guidance for 2016 until next quarter, I do want to touch on a couple of items that Doug mentioned which will impact our 2016 results. These include the downtime associated with Citibank vacating 140,000 square feet at 601 Lexington Avenue, the rent differential and downtime from FAO vacating the GM building for a temporary user during part of 2016, the lease transition at 100 Federal Street, the loss of 200,000 square feet of occupancy in our Washington DC joint venture properties, and the leases expiring at our Gateway project in South San Francisco. Our share of the projected aggregate reduced income from these transactions in 2016 is projected to be approximately $35 million which clips our same-store NOI by about 2% from 2015. Doug also mentioned the contractual sale of our 7 Cambridge Center lab building to its user in early 2016 which will result in the loss of an additional $13.3 million of NOI. These items will impact our 2016 FFO though the effect on our AFFO will be far less significant due to the conversion of free rent to cash rents in the portfolio. We do have positive catalysts to offset these losses including growth from the completion of the lease up of 250 W. 55th Street and 535 Mission as well as the delivery of an additional $850 million of new development between now and the end of 2016. We won't see the full impact of these deliveries in 2016 as several won't deliver until late in the year and they will be in lease up. This pipeline of near-term deliveries has a projected weighted average cash return of between 7.75% and 8% and is projected to stabilize by the end of 2017 generating approximately $70 million of GAAP NOI At stabilization. In addition, we expect our organic growth to pick up late in 2016 and into 2017 with the lease up of our vacant space at the Hancock Tower and 100 Federal Street in Boston, the releasing of the FAO space and the rollup on expiring leases at Embarcadero Center. As I mentioned, we're not prepared to provide our 2016 guidance until next quarter but as you begin thinking about your FFO and AFFO models, we thought this would be helpful. That completes our formal remarks today. I would appreciate it if the operator would open up the lines for the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick with Capital One Securities. Your line is open. Tom Lesnick : I just wanted to quickly just talk about leasing CapEx for a second. It looked like it just a little higher in the quarter. I was just wondering if that was an issue of timing or what is really driving that? Doug Linde : Most of the leasing CapEx is really driven by the makeup of the portfolio so to the extent that we have more urban longer-term leases generally it goes up. But we have typically averaged somewhere in the neighborhood of $30 plus or minus per square foot on a consistent basis on an average basis for the portfolio and there is nothing that occurred this quarter that was significant. Mike LaBelle : I think if you look at the lease terms they were a little longer so our weighted average cost per lease term was like $5.39 I think which is in line with what our range typically is. And I think the renewals were a little bit lower than typical. Again it is just a makeup of whatever is happening that quarter so since we had more new leases versus renewal leases the costs were a little bit higher. Tom Lesnick : And then just switching gears to the build-to-suit opportunities in DC, it looks like one of the projects I think it is a 550,000 square foot project that was in final-round bidding, something was expected to be announced here in the next month or two. Just wondering if there is any progress there at 1006 Sixth Street or if you can comment on that at all? Owen Thomas : So those are two different projects. The one that you were describing I believe was the requirement for the GSA to do the TSA. So Ray, you can comment on that and then the second one is whether we have a tenant for 1001 which is the building in the CBD. Ray Ritchey : So the TSA unfortunately has been caught up in the morass of GSA and while we expected it to take place in the second quarter, we're still awaiting the final award. It is a very competitive process but we have put forth a great offer and a terrific building in Springfield and we're cautiously optimistic that when they finally make an award that we will be under heavy consideration by the GSA. As it relates to 1001 Sixth, we're also in a very competitive process there with a major corporation in DC. We're still in discussions with that group. We know that it has been narrowed down to two or three finalists. We believe we're one of those two or three. We have designed a great building, offered them a very competitive economic package and again we're cautiously optimistic about hearing something positive there as well. Owen Thomas : Both of these projects are effectively 100% leased so there is no speculative risk associated with any available space. Tom Lesnick : And then is there any update on the potential corporate relocation to the Wiehle Avenue site? Owen Thomas : Well, we're in discussions with another corporation that we're under confidentiality with that is considering a site near the Wiehle Metro. Again that should be forthcoming by the next call if not sooner. It would involve us building a building there on their behalf and would involve both a land sale and a fee structure. But again we're not able to announce neither the terms nor the tenant at this point in time. Tom Lesnick : And then now that The Avant is going through really its first season of lease roles, just wondering operationally what the renewal rate is and how you guys are faring on renewal spreads? Doug Linde : The turnover rate is -- Peter, correct me if I'm wrong -- I think 30% and I believe we're achieving a premium over the competition of between 10% and 14% and that includes the stuff in Tyson so it has been spectacular. Peter Johnston : Those are both correct. Operator : The next call is from Manny Korchman with Citi. Your line is open. Manny Korchman : Maybe if we just look at sort of the repositionings, redevelopments that you guys spoke about. How much capital do you need to commit to those projects to get them sort of to where you want them to be in 2017 and onwards? Doug Linde : So the capital has already been committed and it has been spent at the Hancock Tower other than obviously the rollover leasing that we will do. The project at 601 really has not been a fully vetted yet but it is probably somewhere in and around $100 million. We will also be doing a repositioning at 399 at some point in 2016 and 2017. It will be a repositioning light. John would probably describe it as an image change as opposed to a repositioning. And then the project Mike described at Tracer Lane -- or sorry, at Reservoir North is about $25 million, as Owen put out there. And the work that is going to go on at the General Motors building at the retail I think in large part will be based upon the existing tenants and most of that capital will come from the users as opposed to from us. Manny Korchman : And if we stick to the projects that you outlined, a dipping or dragging 2016, how much of a recovery of sort of lost revenues or lost NOI do you expect in 2017 from that same pool? Doug Linde : If you are asking if there is a markdown or not I think there is a dramatic markup in every case. So we will get more than 100% of what we're losing in those rents. I think the only piece of space in the portfolio that is rolling over in 2016 and 2017 where we're a little bit tight on the mark to market is the low rise at 399 where right now on a cash basis, we're getting about $90 a square foot from Citi. It is actually lower than that on a GAAP basis because of a straight line rent and it is the last five years of the lease but John, you can comment on this. I think that we hope to get high 80s to low 90s on that space and higher on an average basis. John Powers : I think that will work out. We already have a couple of very good leads on that space and we're working very well in conjunction with Citi. They may be able to exit part of that early and we're in discussions with a specific tenant now for a portion of that. We do have a challenge, Doug mentioned the below grade space. It is 100,000 feet there and we will be working on that. Manny Korchman : Maybe my last one for Owen, when you think about your acquisition pipeline or opportunities, how do you think about what you would do on balance sheet versus with a partner? Owen Thomas : I think acquisitions today of existing leased buildings -- pricing is aggressive. That is why over the last couple of years we have been pretty active sellers of property. The building in Washington that we just announced at a little bit over $1000 a square foot is the best example.  So the way we're thinking today about acquisitions of again new existing leased buildings is in partnership with Capital Sources, some from the U.S., some from outside the U.S. where we would make a significant coinvestment but we would enhance our return through compensation that we earn from applying our real estate skills whether it be managing the building, leasing the building, providing capital improvements or whatever is required. Operator : Your next question call is from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Jamie Feldman : Can you talk a little bit more about the leasing demand for some of the space you are planning to backfill in 2016, 2017? Specifically the bigger blocks in New York and Boston? Owen Thomas : I will let Bryan talk about Boston and then John can talk about New York. Bryan Koop : One of the things that Doug mentioned earlier was the condition of our supply side in Boston. And one note that we're watching is our competitive set, those buildings that we really compete against on a day-to-day basis in each market is below 6%. And in Cambridge as an example, it is actually sub 2%. So we have got really, really limited supply in terms of who we're competing with on a day-to-day basis versus the whole greater market. But we have actually seen a 3% drop in the CBD market as well in terms of vacancy. So the absorption has been really quite good. We have got good job growth in all sectors. I think the surprising zone to us has been the financial industry that Doug mentioned. We didn't anticipate seeing call it stabilization and job growth especially with the smaller firms on the BC side. So we're seeing it in I think every category. It is not just the tech sector anymore or the biotech sector that we had earlier call it in the recovery of the market. The other side that has been quite surprising is the demand side in the Waltham market. Doug mentioned that we have done two deals with shoe companies. There is companies out there that are growing rapidly and it is all based on original shoe industry and the brands that are growing out there and it is really being perceived as a wonderful place to grow a company right now. Doug Linde : Just to give you some specifics, Jamie, so the big quote unquote holes in our portfolio from an occupancy perspective right now our 100 Fed and at the Hancock Tower and I think I described that we have got literally more demand than we can actually find space for. So we're actually taking space back from tenants and restacking 100 Fed to deal with the 180,000 square feet of availability there. We're in active discussions with tenants on the low rise portion of the Hancock Tower and again based upon what I said about Cambridge as well as the attractive nature of that space, we feel really good about the prospects for that and the pricing that we're asking. I will be brutally honest with you, we have known about the vacancy at the top of the building for the last couple of years and we have yet to lease any of those floors but it is a terrible showing. On the other hand, we're asking for pretty big rents. I mean the rents that we're achieving at the top of the Hancock Tower are starting in the low 80s and higher. And so the pond that we're fishing in has relatively few fish and so we're being patient about that. But we're very confident that they will come by and that we will be able to lease that space and that is why I'm saying that I believe we will do some leasing in 2015 we will do some leasing in 2016 but we may not have revenue produced on that space until sometime in late 2016 or early 2017. And those are really the blocks there. John, do want to comment on New York City? John Powers : Yes, there is not a lot of space so I'll make my comments very brief. 250 is going very well and we have a lot of traffic at the top and we have some term sheets out now. So I think that that has been very well received in the market. We will get some space back from Wiehle. We already have interest in that space, we already have a very nice proposal on a big block part of one floor. We talked about 399 before. Certainly the Towers space, the base, the X Morgan Lewis or existing Morgan Lewis space is not a concern at all in this market, we already have a deal on a big block of that. Doug mentioned that we're doing some significant work at 399. We're tuning that up now with our marketing package. I think the building needs a little bit of loving care and money and we're going to do that and we have done that in a very careful calculated way. So our marketing on that building will really start with images and renderings, etc. in September. But as I said before with regard to the low rise, we have already been in discussions with Citi potentially on getting back perhaps one of the floors or more a little earlier and to target that with some large tenants we're talking about. Owen Thomas : If I could just mention one other thing, we will be adding something that is going to be pretty spectacular at 399 where the Citi auditorium is now on the top of the 13th floor. We're going to put a pavilion there and it will be a green space, it will have a green roof, it will be outdoor space, it will be pretty spectacular and we will connect that with the 14th floor when the lease expires there in 2017. I think that will be a very big enhancement for someone that wants a conference center on that space, a reception on that space. And because of the elevated situation in the building, this may be too micro but Citi had a couple of private elevators. We would be able to connect those directly to the low rise floors so that is, we're very excited about that. Bryan Koop : Some additional color on Boston, this is Bryan Koop, I cannot remember a period of time when we have had as much call it discussion and activity with our existing customers about growth. It is everything from small growth 5000, 10,000 square feet to even large chunks of space, 50,000 to 100,000 square feet. But our existing customer base is where I think we're going to see a good bit of our absorption. Jamie Feldman : Okay. I guess just on New York in terms of the big block demand, I mean you guys sound pretty comfortable you will be able to lock in tenants for both 601 and 399 when that time comes? John Powers : 601, the only block that we will have at 601 will be in the low rise building, that is 145,000 feet. And we're working on a repositioning of that. If it works out the way we want it to, I think that will be a very unique offering in the market in terms of the location, in terms of the outside amenities and what we want to do there. But more on that later. The block at 399 I already spoke about, we already have some interest on. Doug Linde : Just to reiterate what I said in my comments, Jamie, so we don't have places to put Citibank right now physically and we want to relocate them out of that low rise block so that we can reposition and redevelop it and so our guys are creatively looking to figure out ways to take some space back that is currently rent producing and move Citi into that space so that we can actually do this work which is again as I said, we're looking to create vacancy so we can put the capital in to reposition the building to ultimately dramatically enhance the concourse area, the atrium and this low rise space which has a dip in 2016 and 2017 but it is going to be fantastic for the asset as well as for that corner where we have 399, 599 and 601 in a couple of years. Jamie Feldman : And I guess just back to the question on working with a partner to maybe expand the portfolio. We have got the EOP trade in the pipeline, would you be interested in going to a new market? Owen Thomas : Jamie, we're always open and considering new markets. In the markets we would like to be in, I don't think the pricing issue is much different from what we have been describing about our core markets. Also I would point out I think our move into Brooklyn is somewhat of a new market for us albeit in New York City. Operator : Your next call is from Brendan Maiorana with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Brendan Maiorana : Maybe Owen or Doug, so just on the Dock 72 development project there, I guess you guys have a substantial prelease there for one third of it but it is a development project, it doesn't deliver it looks like until maybe late 2017 or early 2018. And it is more of an emerging submarket as opposed to the typical BXP establish submarkets. Does this investment and development project suggest that you guys feel really good about the economic cycle over the next few years? Owen Thomas : I think as I mentioned in my remarks and I have been mentioning over the quarters, we do feel the economic recovery though it has been modest, it has been steady. And we have been getting positive absorption of office space as a result and if you look at where tenant demand and where the real net absorption is, it has been for it the technology, life sciences and other creative tenants and there are districts in major cities throughout the world that are becoming increasingly acceptable to corporations particularly in the technology area. And so we could go city by city and identify new areas that were atypical office locations and I would say Brooklyn is in that category and if you look at what is happening in Brooklyn today, the rent growth that exists, the transit avoidance that Brooklyn provides, we think it is going to reflect tremendous growth for us in the future. So again, we're increasingly making investments if you look around the portfolio of buildings in our core markets or in related core markets that are designed to be attractive to the whole technology, media and life science industries. Doug Linde : I think that is the gating issue which is as we have looked at the Manhattan market, we're very comfortable with our portfolio in midtown Manhattan and the tenant customer that we're pursuing for that portfolio and the growth that that customer is seeing. And we've talked about it ad nauseam before and our ability to lease even large floor plate spaces on Park Avenue that were once headquarters for the universal banks and there are other types of users for that. But we have also recognized that there is a group of tenants that had migrated first to Midtown South and now they are migrating some to the West side, some downtown where many of those employees are coming from Brooklyn and where we're able to build a brand-new building that has all the attributes and the quote unquote cool nature from a physical perspective of what you can get in a building that you could find in Midtown South and others and do it at a much more affordable price than you can achieve today in the same types of buildings and closer to the demographic of where those people actually live and the commuting patterns. And so it is not predicated on a dramatic improvement or continuation of a boom in the economic cycle as much as it is a recognition that this is the reality of how users want to be locating their requirements in the new world of user demand that Manhattan is now seeing. Brendan Maiorana : And then just with respect to outlook on asset recycling, so I think your guidance for the year is $750 million of dispositions. I guess you've -- maybe $200 million is closed year to date, you have got the 5059s which is going to be more. How are you thinking about dispositions for the remainder of the year? Could that guidance number, could it actually come out much different than that number? How should we think about maybe dispositions relative to acquisitions because my read of your comments about potential JVs or what have you maybe seems like you are a little bit more optimistic that you could close an acquisition versus prior commentary? Owen Thomas : To answer your question on the dispositions as we have been saying, our target is 750 and we have done 377 so far this year measured as our share. I think we still feel that the target that we provided is roughly accurate. We have some additional targeted sales that we're considering. We hope to accomplish them and that will result in something around $750 million. I don't see a big break either way on that. On acquisitions, it is very hard to target acquisitions and in fact we don't do that. What we do is we look at investments that we think are in terrific markets that are great properties and we selectively pursue them and if we're able to accomplish the acquisition on economics that make sense for us, we will move forward and if not we don't. So we're out there, we're looking at things but I don't think you should interpret anything from our remarks that we're more likely or less likely to do any acquisitions before the end of the year. Operator : Your next call is from Vance Edelson with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Vance Edelson : So more specifically on Dock 72, can you comment on the terms and the discount if you would characterize it as such that someone like a WeWork requires to make a 20-year commitment to a fairly large block versus the $60 per square foot that I think you mentioned you hope to get when you lease the more conventional way? John Powers : Well, WeWork brought a lot to the table to this collaborative effort and my now long experience dealing with ground-up development and major buildings, the anchor tenant always gets somewhat of an advantage deal and WeWork did in this case. But the other issue is WeWork took primarily the base of the building which will in most cases rent for less and we're comfortable with their terms and it has been folded into our pro forma. Finally, let me say that they do have options and the options that they have will be at a different price than they paid for their initial take. Vance Edelson : And when you say they are bringing a lot to the table and you are referring to them as a codeveloper, just to be clear, could you expand on their involvement? Presumably there is no financial commitment it is just planning and advice so of speak given their experience with collaborative space, is that a good way to think about it? John Powers : We're going to have significant amenities space there. We're going to have a very interesting food offering [Technical Difficulty] we will have a basketball court, we will have a lawn for our different activities. We have conference space, we have a very, very large wellness center and they are curating all of that on our behalf under an arrangement. So we think that that is going to add something. They are very good at doing this. And we think that also their input and impact to the development is going to be a positive in terms of other tech tenants and when they look at WeWork, many of them think they are like-minded and want the same things and I think they have been very, very successful doing a curation of different parts of their member base, dealing with parts of their member base. Vance Edelson : And then just sticking with the Navy Yard in general, the transit avoidance that you mentioned notwithstanding, one of the concerns we hear is that the subway stops are not particularly close. So do you have any comments on future transportation or mass transit enhancements that might remedy the situation especially given the possibility of more development there over time? Or do you picture the employees living so close that that is how they are avoiding mass transit? John Powers : Certainly there is a move to, as Doug said -- to Brooklyn as a choice to live for many of the TAMI workers. That is a clear trend that has been going on for quite some time. And if you drive around Brooklyn, you probably see as many or more cranes there than you do in Manhattan and most of that is residential. So certainly that is a part of it but clearly a big part of that is going to be dealing with what I call the last mile issue. So just to put this in context, 70,000 people worked in the Navy Yard during World War II. They all got to work, they all went home and most of them used subways. The Navy Yard is within one mile of about six different subway lines. So the question that -- the challenge we really have is to solve this last mile issue because where those people walk the last mile, our creative workers probably don't have the time or want to allocate the time to do that although a lot of them will bike and I think biking is part of the answer here. But we will run two shuttle services. They will be reliable, efficient and very tech friendly. We will put these together in collaboration with WeWork and the Navy Yard and we will run those two locations, one on the G train by Washington Ave stop and one between the A train and the F Train. And these trains for example, you get to the A train, the first stop is the Folsom Street in New York plus these trains go out into Brooklyn to a lot of places where these people want to live. So we think we have a last mile problem. We know it, we have studied it and we're going to have a very good solution that we think is going to work very well. Vance Edelson : And then just one last question shifting gears, down in DC it sounds like a lot of your decisions these days are driven by your long term prospectives. So could you comment on how the CBD's strength or lack thereof may have played into your decision to sell 505 Ninth or would you characterize that decision as one that is more long term in nature and would have been the same even if DC had made a major step in the right direction in the past year? Ray Ritchey : I will take a crack at that. It is Ray Ritchey. The specific on 505 Ninth Street was really a concern and a respect for our partnership. We have a 50-50 partnership there with two families that have generational concerns. We looked at the point in time both in the cycle of the building and the cycle of the market and we felt it was best to advise our partnership to take it to the market and see what we could get. And we're going to net a value over 1000 square foot. We're still strongly committed to the CBD, Washington DC. The successfully have at 601 Mass I think demonstrates the depth and breadth that the market is still there. Our ability to retain tenants in our existing buildings and attract new ones while we do have vacancy, we're still all-in in the CBD in Washington DC. Owen Thomas : I can also add to that as we said in the past on dispositions, I think more or less fall into a couple of different categories. One, assets that we would consider non-core going forward and others where we frankly got we think a very attractive price relative to the economics in the property. And this deal given the pricing that I described we felt it was an attractive opportunity for us to raise some money. Doug Linde : And to be fair to your question, we have sold a lot of assets in DC. But I think the gating issue for us has been when you sign a 20 year lease in DC with 2.5% or 3% increases, you have effectively created a long term bond and this is exactly what the sovereign wealth fund and domestic pension fund advisors are dying to own. And there is not a lot of churn in these assets that we can do on a going forward basis until those leases expire. And interestingly while we have had the success of moving tenants within our portfolio in some of our other markets or within buildings, in DC interestingly enough because of the long term nature of these leases, we haven't really done a lot of that. So when we look at our portfolio and look at our portfolio as to what is most salable, it hits the needle on the head and it is the kind of assets that are exactly what are most desired in today's capital markets. Operator : Your next call is from Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Craig Mailman : Maybe just talk about San Francisco a little bit. It sounds like you have some good activity at Salesforce Tower but 181 Fremont is still last I heard vacant and then Park Tower looks like it is going forward. I know the completion dates are a little bit different for the three assets. But can you talk a little bit about how that is affecting tenant conversations and potentially rent growth in that couple of block radius? Bob Pester : First off, 181 Fremont, it is all lower floors that they have available and they are much smaller floor plates, they are 14,000 square foot range. So although it is competition we don't see it as great competition for the floors that we have available at Salesforce Tower. Block five, not going to deliver until probably 2019. It has all the trailers and construction activity for the Transbay Terminal right now. I know they keep saying that they are going to deliver in 2018. I just don't see how that is going to happen. Again, that is a smaller floor plate building and it gets smaller as the building rises. It is a nice building with outdoor decks but it is probably going to lag us by a year and a half to two years. Although it is competition I don't see it as major competition for us as well. I know Doug mentioned on Salesforce Tower that we have got good activity. We're actually exchanging paper with several tenants right now and the tour activity is as good as I have ever seen on a building under construction. Craig Mailman : And then, Mike, I know you had mentioned maybe doing some debt repayments earlier depending on what the prepayment is. Could you just walk through kind of what pieces of debt are potentially kind of 2015 repayments and kind of what you're NPV analysis or cutoffs would be to do that in 2015 versus wait until 2016? Mike LaBelle : So we've basically got three pieces of debt coming due, the smallest one is Fountain Square which is a building that we own in a consolidated joint venture right now and we expect to be buying it out sometime either late this year or early next year. And that loan can be prepaid in I think it is April and we would just pay that off, that is about $200 million. And then there are two bigger ones which is Embarcadero Center and the Hancock Tower loan and those total about $1 billion. I would say those are the two loans we're thinking about with regard to maybe doing something early and that is why we haven't been targeting our hedging toward those two financings. What we really kind of think about is okay, how much is the prepayment penalty and if we bundle that into our costs, what does the breakeven rate have to be when we can pay these loans off and how do we feel about that breakeven rate versus our view of rates? It is somewhere between 75 and 80 basis points, something like that today. One could say that is attractive. However, the prepayment penalty does come down significantly every month that we wait. So we're tracking this on a monthly basis depending on what the yield curve does. If you look at the yield curve and what it says it is going to do today, that breakeven rate drops below 50 basis points in early 2016. So that would be maybe a more attractive time, we will see what happens. The yield curve doesn't ever seem to be completely right as we all know but that is the kind of analysis we're thinking about so we don't have a specific point in time in mind but we're monitoring it and if we see an attractive window I think that we will go forward with it. Operator : Your next call is from Gabriel Hilmoe with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Gabriel Hilmoe : I guess, Mike, I realize you are not giving official guidance for next year yet but obviously a lot of ins and outs going into 2016 which it sounds like next year may be somewhat of a mirror to 2015 at least from a same-store growth perspective. But can you just walk through the pieces that will be coming into the same-store pool next year that I guess will at least be additive from development that isn't directly impacting same-store results this year? And I guess if you can quantify just what the expected cash impact is that maybe is offsetting -- I think you mentioned the 2% hit from 601 Lexington, 100 Federal, FAO and some of the other drags? Mike LaBelle : The three buildings that will be coming into the same-store that aren't in the same-store this year are 250 W. 55th Street, 535 Mission and The Avant. So, those three haven't been in our quoted same-store numbers that I give to you. The Avant is leased up through 2015, it is fully leased now so it has been fully leased for the past couple of quarters. So it will have an increase but not a significant one. 250 as Doug mentioned I think in our supplemental, it is 70% leased. As Doug mentioned, it is 89% leased with leases that haven't commenced it and we've got good activity on the rest of the space at the rents that Doug and John had mentioned. So I think that is going to be a big mover for us next year from both a GAAP and a cash basis because probably through half of this year some of the tenants were in pre-rent. I mean Case-Shiller was in pre-rent through the first half of this year. You actually saw our straight line go down from the first quarter to the second quarter. They were the reason and there are some other tenants that are in pre-rent in 2015 that won't be in 2016. And then at 535 Mission, kind of obviously smaller building but kind of similar story with some terms of the lease up with that. Again I don't want to give you specific numbers right now but those are the kind of bigger drivers from the development pipeline that are going to help. Gabriel Hilmoe : Okay, I think you mentioned what the expectation of at least what the FFO impact was going to be. Could you just maybe repeat that? Mike LaBelle : I mentioned that there is $35 million of transactions that Doug mentioned where we're going to lose occupancy that will be a negative. On the development pipeline, I indicated that we would be stabilizing $850 million of developments between 2016 and 2017 that by the end of 2017 when those are all stabilized, they are going to add approximately $70 million of GAAP NOI and have a cash return of between 7.75% and 8%. But again that is stabilizing through 2016 and 2017. So it will start to influence and a building like 601 Mass Avenue is a building that will help us in 2016 but it is not going to be in the same-store in 2016. None of those developments the $850 million will be in the same store in 2016 but the income that is starting to come from those things will start in 2016 and help us. Operator : Your next call is from Brad Burke with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Brad Burke : I appreciate the comment that you are able to fund with cash everything that you currently have in the development pipeline. I was just hoping to get an update on what you are thinking about in terms of the possibility of paying a special based on the sales activity that you have had this year? And if you were to pay a special, how we should think about sources of capital to fund the current development pipeline and then in anything else that you might add to it? Mike LaBelle : I can tell you that the gain associated with the assets that we have sold already as well as the projected gain for 505 W. Ninth assuming it sells, is approximately $200 million. From a taxable income perspective, we have sized our regular dividend to be generally in line with our taxable income. So I would expect that that $200 million or somewhere thereabouts would be excess. We have set these up as 1031s to try to retain that cash but we have talked about the acquisition environment and the low likelihood of us being able to put those into exchanges. And with 505 Ninth Street is a joint venture so you really have to acquire in the same joint venture so I would say that is pretty unlikely that we would be successful in doing that. Doug Linde : Just to sort of answer the second part of your question, there are absolutely no capital raising liquidity issues that we have regardless of what the special dividend might be based upon gains on sale so that is not a factor in the way we're thinking about this. As Mike described, we're running at the lowest EBITDA ratio I think we have ever run as a public company. And I think it is a little premature to talk about our dividend policy without having had a conversation with our Board which we generally have toward the end of the third quarter because it is not appropriate to get out ahead of that. Brad Burke : Okay, but just reading into that, we should think about incremental sources of capital being balance sheet cash and debt versus significant additional asset sales as we think about 2016. Is that a fair way to summarize it? Mike LaBelle : Owen said $750 million was 2015. I don't think we have described what if any asset sale plans we have for 2016. And we're not, I don't think at this point we're prepared to talk about that, but we do not -- I want to emphasize this -- have a capital liquidity issue. We're sitting on more cash than we have ever sat on and we continue to find opportunities to increase our cash flow from the portfolio. And many of the new projects that we're entering into like the Brooklyn Navy Yard are with partners where we will provide third-party construction financing for a significant portion of the capital structure. So again, the amount of equity, quote/unquote or our share of the capital is not significant relevant to what it might have been had we done things on our own and we were doing everything on our balance sheet. Brad Burke : And then just a quick one on GAAP same-store guidance for 2015, you have been trending above the full year guidance for the first half of the year. And I think I heard you indicate that occupancy would be relatively flat with current levels for the balance of the year. So you gave us a lot of things to think about over the next couple of quarters, but I was hoping that you could highlight a couple of the bigger ones that might be driving the expected deceleration. Mike LaBelle : We talked about the GM Building with FAO Schwarz. I mentioned from a GAAP perspective, that didn't have a material impact to the full year. But we recognized a lot of termination income from that deal this quarter. So for the last two quarters, that building will have a lower contribution. I think that from an occupancy perspective, I said that we would be approximately where we're. Last quarter, I think I said we would be slightly below 91%. Our occupancy projections are really in the same place that they were. So they are going to be somewhere around 91%. It could be slightly below, it could be a touch higher, but I consider that generally stable with what it is now -- below 91%, I'm sorry. So that is really kind of the drivers. Operator : Your next call is from Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors. Your line is open. Jed Reagan : I know you are not giving 2016 guidance yet but broadly speaking just given all of the moving parts you have outlined, is it fair to think about 2016 as sort of a transition year with flattish type of occupancy and cash same-store NOI growth just sort of akin to this year? Doug Linde : I would characterize 2016 as a year where we have made some explicit decisions to take some chips off the table in order to reposition assets for the long term that will be significantly accretive to our NAV and our earnings on a going forward basis. And so those things have significant impacts. So not sure that is a transition, those are explicit decisions. Transition is you have a lot of roll over and you have to sort of run through the rollover. We have that every year. We may have a little bit more in 2017 actually than we have in 2016 because of what is going on at 399 and that is a pretty big chunk of space. But I would characterize 2016 as we're making some very explicit investment decisions and we have chosen to take some chips off of the table from an occupancy perspective in order to reposition and improve the long term cash flow characteristics and value of some of our assets. Jed Reagan : And just wondering if you have seen any evidence at all of upward pressure on cap rates in your core markets just given some of the recent changes in treasury yields and borrowing costs? And I guess related to that, Mike, you mentioned the sub 4% execution you would get on 10 year bonds, today just wondering if that would be closer to 3% or 4% at this point? Mike LaBelle : On the question with respect to the weight capital or interest by investors we have not seen any diminution in that at all. And I would also point out that a lot of the investors that we see in the marketplace are not using significant leverage so I don't think interest rates have as big an impact at least for Class A office properties in our core market. Doug Linde : I think somebody mentioned some Blackstone selling. You are likely going to hear about or see a print on the assets that Blackstone is currently selling in Boston and I don't think we're surprised at where those assets are going to trade. And they are going to I think look at again you are going to look at our portfolio and you were going to go wow. We purchased a building in 2011 at the Hancock Tower now called 200 Clarendon Street for $435 a square foot and it is the superior asset in the city and you are going to see I expect a print that is more than double that if not significantly more than that over the next month or so with those other assets. And it is a demonstration that there is a continued desirability for these core iconic assets in our markets. And interestingly in some of these markets, they are starting to become somewhat of a scarcity issue as well because there are relatively few assets that will likely be sold over the next number of years. And the new buyers that have come in are I think what one would characterize as not transitional buyers but long term buyers who expect to own these assets not necessarily forever but certainly for an extended period of time with a very long term horizon in terms of how they are going to invest in the assets. Jed Reagan : And then just, Mike, on the unsecured debt question? Mike LaBelle : So the unsecured debt market right now, our credit spreads are somewhere in the 150s I would say for 10 years. So we're talking about a borrowing rate today of somewhere 380 to 390 probably and if you were talking about the secured debt market, I think that for high quality assets that have pretty low leverage, 50% to 60% leverage, you are talking 160 basis points, 170 basis points maybe a little bit tighter than that. And then as the leverage goes up, it could be north of 200 basis points but generally borrowing costs again are in and around 4%. The other thing I want to mention on your same store question is when you look at the quarterly same stores -- I'm quoting an annual same-store so in the supplemental we quoted quarterly to quarterly so a property like The Avant might be in the quarterly to quarterly but it would not be in the annual to the annual. So there is a little bit of a difference in the same-store profile when you think about that. Jed Reagan : And just last one on the upcoming GSA expirations you guys talked about in DC, do you think they will be making long term decisions on those spaces or do you think it could be more of sort of a kicking the can down the road and short-term holdovers over the next couple of years? Peter Johnston : On the bulk of it, it is likely going to be kicking the can for the reasons Doug described. There are going to be certain procurements similar to the one we're chasing down in Springfield where because it is a consolidation and they may be able to align the need for new space along with the fact that the existing facility doesn't meet the necessary security requirements that they are actually going to go and make the jump because they have been able to argue to Congress that they need the money for the consolidation. But I think the bulk of it will likely be kicking the can for as I said the reasons Doug described. Operator : Your next call is from John Guinee with Stifel. Your line is open. John Guinee : Doug, you said something very interesting when you were talking about the General Motors retail space where you just offhandedly said that that cost would be covered by the retail tenants which sort of begs the question on office tenants. It seems to us that tenant improvements have been stubbornly high despite improving markets. Is there any chance that tenant improvement costs or releasing costs come down as these markets continue to improve? Or is that cost sort of embedded in the business and the landlord is effectively a financier of the tenants? Doug Linde : I will give you a general comment, John and if any of our regional folks want to chime in, please feel free. I would say that the marginal change in tenant improvement dollars has been de minimis through good and bad cycles other than with renewal tenants in the hyper hot markets where we basically say if you want to renew we're not giving you any money. I think the actual cost of doing improvements has gone up exponentially over the past four or five years and so what once would cover a tenant's build out at $65 or $70 a square foot is probably covering maybe 50% of it in our CBD locations. And so I think that it is a factual part of the business that we're all in. But we certainly don't see it other than in Washington DC where the market has been weaker; we really haven't seen much of an increase in it over the past four or five years either. Operator : Your next call is from Manny Korchman with Citi. Your line is open. Manny Korchman : If we just think about your multifamily comments you made in the pipeline going forward, what kind of dollars are we thinking about in the multifamily projects? Owen Thomas : There were two that I mentioned that were in the pre-development pipeline and I don't think we want to get into a tremendous amount of specifics over their costs and we're still working out all the details of it. But I would say approximately actually a little bit depends on, it depends on some decisions that we make about some of the projects that we have. If I had to give you a range I would probably say $300 million to $600 million. Manny Korchman : And would those be long term holds within the portfolio or something more like the Avenue where you would hold it until you sort of found a good spot in the cycle to sell? Owen Thomas : We're not building the residential to sell it when it is complete because it is residential. There were some case facts around The Avenue that led us to conclude that was a good asset to sell but they are not immediately targeted for sale when they are complete. Manny Korchman : And my final question, given the partnership you discussed with WeWork in Brooklyn, any considerations or any discussions with WeLive on the residential side of things? Owen Thomas : No. Operator : At this time, I would like to turn the call back to management for any additional remarks. Owen Thomas : Well, just to summarize, we were slightly above consensus for the quarter. We increased our guidance slightly for 2015 and hopefully we provided you helpful details on investments that we're electing to make to enhance our portfolio that have some impact on 2016 results. With that, thank you for all of your attention. Operator : This concludes today's Boston Properties conference call. Thank you again for attending and have a good day.",

During the question-and-answer portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, our Executive Vice President of Acquisitions and Development and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions. I would like to now turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks. Owen Thomas : Okay, thank you, Arista and good morning everyone. Our focus today in addition to market conditions and strategy will be on the 2016 guidance we provided in our release last night and a further discussion of our growth opportunities in 2017 and beyond. On current results, we produced another solid quarter with FFO per share of $0.05 above consensus and $0.06 above our guidance. We have increased our full year 2015 FFO guidance by $0.06 per share and provided you a projection for 2016 FFO per share over 2% above 2015 estimates. Our 2016 projected FFO growth would have been 4%, excluding the dilution from the asset sales that we conducted this year and we will have next year. Further, on our most recent Investor Relation materials, we outlined that for 2017 we see the potential for $80 million in same-property NOI growth over 2015 from a select group of our assets, as well as an additional $72 million in annualized NOI from developments by the end of 2017. We own and manage many significant buildings with large tenants, several of which are rolling over in 2015 and \u201816. And these larger spaces can take time to backfill. Further, we are planning proactive investments in some of our properties such as the retail of the GM Building and the low-rise building at 601 Lexington Avenue, which have short-term dilution impacts, but long-term benefits to our company\u2019s earnings. Though our projected 2016 FFO growth is more modest for these reasons, we believe Boston Properties has the potential to deliver material NOI growth in 2017 given our lease up opportunities and development underway. Through all of our comments on this call, you will hopefully get a more detailed understanding of the progress made to-date and executing on these growth opportunities. Now, turning to the economy and the operating environment, though we had a clear volatility spike in the financial markets in August driven primarily by China economic growth fears, our views on the U.S. economy have not changed materially over the last quarter. U.S. GDP growth is steady, but tepid with third quarter growth announced yesterday slowing to 1.5% and approximately 2.5% growth projected for all of 2015. A similar story exists for employment, where 142,000 jobs were created in September, which is lower than the average for the past year and wages are growing at around an annual rate of 2.2%. As evidenced by the jobs data in corporate earnings, certain sectors of the U.S. economy are experiencing a challenging business environment, particularly industrial production and energy given low oil prices. Our assets are located in coastal markets that are not as directly affected by weakness in these sectors. Office property market conditions remain healthy and improving. Office net absorption remains steady with 13.9 million square feet absorbed in the last quarter and 1.2% of stock absorbed over the last year in major U.S. markets. Construction remained just above long-term averages of 2.1% of stock and annual rent growth was approximately 4% nationally over the last quarter and positive, particularly in San Francisco across all our major markets, except downtown Washington D.C. We leased 1.3 million square feet of space in the third quarter having completed 89 leases and our occupancy remained roughly flat at 91.3% for the quarter. The private capital markets for real estate remained strong in our core markets as well. Interest rates continue to be favorable with the 10-year U.S. Treasury currently trading just above 2% and transaction volumes and pricing remain at elevated levels. We continue to see strong interest from domestic and offshore investors in Class A office assets. There is, however, a significant pipeline of real estate currently in the market and pricing levels maybe tested this fall given the supply of product, higher volatility in the public capital markets and the prospect of an interest rate hike before year end. For all of these reasons, our fundamental capital strategy has not changed. We are continuing to sell selected assets to fund special dividends and developments, which we continue to deliver at lower prices per square foot and materially higher yields than where existing assets are trading. Now, moving to the specific execution of our capital strategy let me begin with acquisitions. We continue to evaluate new acquisitions but are finding pricing challenging and uncompetitive from a financial return perspective with our development opportunities. This past quarter, we did close on the previously contracted acquisition of the 50% interest in Fountain Square at Reston Town Center we did not own for $206.5 million. The pricing of the acquisition was a 5.5% cap rate on 2016 NOI and $545 per square foot. We also remain active on dispositions. Since our last call, we completed the previously described sale of a 50% interest in 505 9th Street in Washington, D.C. for $318 million and a land parcel in Gaithersburg, Maryland for $30 million. We also just placed under contract to a user Innovation Place in San Jose, California for $207 million. Innovation Place is comprised of four existing buildings totaling 538,000 square feet. Three of the buildings are currently vacant in the fourth \u2013 with the fourth becoming vacant in 2016. The site has a total of 26 acres and can support 537,000 square feet of additional development. It is our expectation that the user will build additional structures on the site for which we will be engaged as development manager. This is an exciting sale for Boston Properties, in that it generates $207 million in sale proceeds, represents a gain of approximately $78 million, reduces the overall vacancy of the company and creates a new client relationship and development assignment for us. Assuming Innovation Place closes as scheduled before year end, we will have sold $743 million in assets on a gross basis and $584 million assets on an our share basis in 2015. Our total projected 2015 tax gains from sales would be approximately $285 million and could result in another special dividend this year. It is our expectation that we will not have additional sale activity in 2015. However, we will continue to be opportunistic with asset sales in general and evaluate targeted sales of non-core assets for 2016. Turning now to developments, we have had a very productive quarter executing our pipelines. Starting with deliveries, we placed in service Annapolis Junction 7 from our active development pipeline. The building is a 100% leased to the GSA and it\u2019s generating an unleveraged initial cash yield of 8.3% on our investment of $17.5 million. We were also able to move two important projects from our predevelopment pipeline into our active development portfolio this past quarter. 88 Ames Street is a 22-story 164,000 square foot, 274-unit Class A urban multifamily development with street level retail located adjacent to our successful Kendall Center property in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The project will cost approximately $140 million to develop and will be delivered in 2018. Further, we received our entitlements to commence the development of the Signature Site, a two tower, 514,000 rentable square foot residential development located in our highly successful Reston Town Center community. The Signature site comprises 508 residential units and 24,000 square feet of associated retail space and preleasing discussions are advanced for the retail component. The property will cost $217 million to develop and will be delivered in 2018. 88 Ames Street and the Signature Site are forecast to generate an average unleveraged initial yield of approximately 6% upon their delivery in 2018. We have also advanced several of our predevelopment projects in Boston closer to actual development. Preleasing continues in North Station and it is our expectation that we will be able to launch the podium phase of this project in the fourth quarter. Further, we executed amendment to our ground lease related to the 100 Clarendon Street garage, which provides with a payment of $37 million for a lease extension to 99 years, our commencement of the management of the Back Bay station, as well as an option to purchase sites, which require entitlement above the garage and stations. This is an exciting investment opportunity for Boston Properties over the longer term. Our current development pipeline has 14 projects in all four of our major regions and is comprised on an hour share basis of 4.7 million square feet and $2.7 billion in total development cost. In the aggregate, the commercial space in our development is 59% preleased. These projects will be delivered in the fourth quarter of 2015 through 2018 at a projected unleveraged cash yield of over 7.5% for the office component and around 6% for the multifamily. We have 90% of the cash required to complete these developments on our balance sheet and they will add approximately 4% to the compound annual growth of our FFO through 2018. Let me now turn over the discussion to Doug for a further review of the property markets and our operations. Doug Linde : Thanks Owen. Good morning everybody. While our leasing and our overall investment actions are pretty influenced by what we view is long-term perspectives on the various market conditions, you are going to hear a lot less about this from me this quarter. And I am going to really spend most of my time talking about the factors impacting the next 12 to 18 months and the issues in our portfolio market conditions, the space that we are working on to lease or re-lease, how we are going to achieve that significant incremental NOI that Owen just described from our portfolio, as well as the growing contribution from our ongoing development investments. That\u2019s going to be the focus of my comments. A couple of comments on our \u2013 on some of the supplemental first though. So overall, leasing activity in the third quarter picked up from the second. We were slightly more than the second quarter by about 100,000 square feet. Those second generation statistics had some interesting SKUs and that I sort of I wanted to highlight. In fact, each of the various regions had something going on with it. So in Boston, there was a pretty significant uptick and that was really from two transactions. The first was a lot of leasing that was done in Cambridge. Those \u2013 leases were actually signed in 2014. And then there were a number of leases at 200 Clarendon Street and the increase in the net rents on all of those transactions was over 100%. Interestingly, San Francisco looks pretty muted. And the reason for that is two fold. The first is that there was a large renewal at Gateway that was done in 2013 that was actually 60% of the square footage that was in the stats. And then the EC office number interestingly, while it was only positive 25% on a net basis that was because there was a 5-year renewal that was done in 2012 on about 50% of the square footage in the EC and that was done at $50 a square foot with dollar bumps. Interestingly, we have just completed the lease this quarter, one floor above that lease where we did a same as is 5-year renewal for the starting rent on the new transaction is $70 with 3% increases. So you can sort of get a sense of the dramatic increase in rents in San Francisco just over the past 3 years. In DC, we have a large law firm renewal completed in \u201814 that became effective this quarter and the rent went from 46 net to 38 net, but that\u2019s on a last contractual rent number to the beginning contractual number. So 2.5% increase is the actual GAAP rent is actually higher than $46 over the term 15-year lease. And in New York City, there was a former city floor that was re-leased at 601, where the rent went from $109 to $79. And with 540 supplemental where we did a 20,000 square foot deal at base of the building where the rent went from $135 to $70. Just to gauge any concerns, are our mark to market in New York City right now, as it stands in 2016 is over $9 a square foot and in 2017, it\u2019s pretty flat and I will talk about what\u2019s going on in \u201817 as we get into 3.99. So let me begin my formal remarks on our markets with Midtown Manhattan. So during the quarter, we did 12 deals for about 90,000 square feet. Ten of those deals had starting rent over $90 a square foot and seven of those deals were above $100 a square foot. The bulk of our availability and rollover in the portfolio in the next few years occurs in spaces that come in rents in excess of $100 a square foot. While it\u2019s a small subset of the Midtown market, it continues to be a very healthy and growing one. Activity is expanding, overall there has been an average about 870,000 square feet of leases done per year since 2011, over $100 a square foot and about 30% of that is new. And in 2015, we have already seen 900,000 square feet of activity above $100 a square foot and about 35% of that is new. Nonetheless, the transaction size continues to be small with a preponderance of the activity of leases under 10,000 square feet for non-renewals and there are relatively few deals above 40,000 square feet for renewals. So you have the temper what\u2019s going on in that market given the scope of the transaction sites. We are fully leased at 510 Madison, no rollover until \u201817. We are working through those law firm rebuilds that we have been describing at 599 Lex and we are going to be getting back the three floors of swing space in 2016, late \u201816 where we already have leases out on two of those floors, with rents over $90 a square foot. At 250 West 55th, we have leases out on all of our remaining pre-builds and we have half lower deals on two of the remaining three available floors. We expect to have full revenue contribution by the third quarter of \u201816 at 250 West 55th. We are seeing heavy traffic across the entire portfolio, but with very limited current vacancies, most of our transactions revolve future availability. At 767 Fifth, we are getting back 80,000 square feet in July of 2018, the expiring rent \u2013 excuse me, the expiring rent is under $100 a square foot and we expect that space to lease for over $180 a square foot. We are actively marketing the former FBO space, which will be available for lease in early \u201917. And we have active interest from tenants ranging in size from 14,000 square feet to the entire 65,000 square foot unit. At 399 Park, there are 640,000 square feet expiring in \u201817. We have 280,000 square feet of the base leased to Citi and we are in lease discussions on 180,000 square feet with starting rents equivalent to Citi\u2019s expiring rent in the high 80s. There was a 97,000 square foot block in the lower portion of the building. We have got a proposal out on 75,000 square feet and over $105 a square foot. There is 150,000 square foot of block in the middle of the building, we are going to get that back in September of \u201817 if leased it about $100 a square foot and we expect to achieve rents over $115 a square foot. And the final Citi block is of 110,000 square feet of below grade space and that\u2019s leased at about $50 a square foot. At 601 Lex, we are in the planning stages of a major repositioning of the retail in the low-rise building. We are working on a plan to vacate the entire 140,000 square foot office building including 70,000 square feet that currently under leased to Citi. This is going to result in \u201816 and \u201817 additional vacancy as we renovate that portion of the complex. We have no vacancy right now at 601 and so the New York team is actively looking at ways we can control currently leased space. So, we can move forward with these plans. This quarter, we actually took back a floor at the top of the building in order to accommodate the potential repositioning. This is high contribution space, which is going to result in the diminishing of 16 occupancy and revenue, but consistent with our core strategy and philosophy, we are making decisions with the long-term to maximizing the value of the asset and the portfolio. In DC, our development at 601 Mass opened in September, a little bit early. The office space is 86% leased, the retail is 100% leased and the income contribution will ramp up in \u201816 and fully contribute in \u201817. This development is being delivered at an initial stabilized cash return in excess of 8%. While the delivery impacted citywide brokerage statistics negatively this quarter, our view really is that the overall market conditions in the CBD of Washington, D.C. haven\u2019t really changed much. The district continues to be very competitive since there just hasn\u2019t been a lot of significant increase in user demand. We completed another major renewal of our law firm deals at 1330 Connecticut where the incumbent tenant renewed for 15 years on 212,000 square feet of approximately 240,000 square feet currently occupied. That new rent is going to commence in \u201817. The rent rollup is over 25% on a net basis. As part of this transaction, we will be using 52,000 square feet of 1333 New Hampshire space, which is across the street as swing space. This space is technically leased, but it\u2019s not going to be revenue-producing until the repositioning of 1330 is over. And that space would ultimately rent for over $65 a square foot growth today. We are making steady progress on all the availability at our JV assets at Market Square North, 901 and Met Square. Activity in Reston continues to be very strong, though with limited availability again in our portfolio. Activity really is involving, extending and expanding tenants by accommodating takeovers and sublets. All of this is in the context of starting rents above $50 a square foot in the urban core. Our portfolio has a vacancy rate of under 3%. Overall, Reston vacancy is 14%, Roslyn is over 30%, Tyson is over 18%, and that\u2019s just actual vacancy not availability. The weakest subset of our DC portfolio is the GSA-related properties in Springfield and Annapolis Junction. And while the user groups want to need space, the GSA mandated densification and to-date, the lack of appropriations in the defense complex have severely limited current demand. We hope that the changes with the House of Representatives and the changes with sequestrations and the new budget deal will in fact add to the demand for the defense complex and improve our leasing prospects in these properties. The Boston CBD continues to be a really good market as supplies dwindled over the past few years. Although, there is speculative development in the Seaport and we are obviously adding inventory to the Back Bay with 888, demand is currently lease expiration driven. At 120 St. James, that\u2019s the low-rise of 200 Clarendon area, we have 180,000 square feet of availability and we have responded to three full block proposals in the last 90 days, each anticipates full utilization of the space in 2017. At 200 Clarendon in the high-rise, we completed 88,000 square feet of leasing this quarter, including one floor in that 150,000 square foot block from 44 to 48. While we have seen interest from a few multi-floor users, the high end demand in Boston has typically been for users under 30,000 square feet and we expect to lease this space in smaller units. As we said previously, we expect to have a rent commencement on all the space towards the end of 2016 and into 2017. At 888 Boylston Street, we have topped out the steel, we are 71% leased. We actually completed our first retail lease this month with an 18,000 square foot multi-floor user. We have extensive conversations going on with retailers in all of the remaining retail space at 888, which we expect to open in 11 months and a few months after, that will open a few months before or excuse me after the office space opens in the summer of 2016, and so 888 will have full contribution by the end of 2017. Since we have no availability in Cambridge, I just have a few comments there. Asking rents are now in excess of $80 a square foot and in spite of the recent volatility in the life science industry, as well as some job reductions around specific companies, there continues to be a flow of new tenants looking for a beachhead in Cambridge, which is home to both the life science and technology businesses. Lack of available supply continues to be the story. The Cambridge Redevelopment Authority has made this submittal to the city for up-zoning of our Kendall Square project and we hope to have some clarity on our ability to build more space by the end of the year. There is no real update on the Volpe site disposition. The GSA schedule suggests an award in early \u201817, which means no additional spaces at Volpe for four to five years. In Waltham, that metro market continues to get stronger driven by organic expansion. This quarter, we did 19 leases in our suburban portfolio, 150,000 square feet and we had a similar amount under lease negotiation right now. All of the space at 10 CityPoint is committed, rents in excess of $50 a square foot for the top floor. The project will deliver in mid \u201816 at a cash return over 8%. Rents have increased 25% over the last 18 months at our CityPoint project. While there is no speculative construction currently underway, our reservoir north renovation where we basically scraped the building other than the structure is very much underway and we anticipate rents in the mid to high 40s of significant upgrade from the expiring rents that we had in May in the low 30s. Again, this won\u2019t occur until 2017. At the \u2013 finally, I want to talk about San Francisco. At the June NAREIT meeting, there was a real focus on demand in San Francisco and whether we were seeing signs of concern. Now, we\u2019ve lay off the Twitter and the limited activity in the IPO market, I think it\u2019s become another renewed topic of conversations. Well, between 2011 and 2014, the annual CBD leasing activity averaged about 9.3 million square feet and absorption was about 1.5 million square feet a year. Through the end of the third quarter this year, there has been about 6 million square feet of completed transactions and 1.4 million square feet of absorption. Leasing activity continues to be healthy. Tech demand has averaged about 55% of this activity, where there has been sublet space, it\u2019s been small pockets and it\u2019s leased for strong rents. Last quarter, the big news was that Apple grabbed the sublet space at 235 Second. Our largest sublet is our Morgan Lewis space at EC 3 stemming from the merger with Bingham, 125,000 square feet expires in August of 2016. We are negotiating leases for three of the five floors right now and have multiple proposals out on the rest of the space. We get the space back, as I said in August of \u201816. The anticipated rollup is over 100% on this 125,000 square foot block. There is speculative new construction in the city, 181 Fremont and 333 Bush and Block 40 are all under construction adding about 1.4 million square feet, but the vacancy rate is under 6%, total availability is under 8.5% and after an FAR deposit in October, the Prop M Bank is currently under 1.75 million square feet and that\u2019s it. Down in the valley, Apple committed to another 800,000 square feet in the new development. They are purchasing additional land in North San Jose, Palo Alto Networks is growing, Google is growing, Aruba is growing, Toshiba is growing, General Dynamics is growing, Silver Spring Networks is growing they have all committed to large new expansions. At Embarcadero Center, we completed another 116,000 square feet of leases during the quarter. The largest deal was 41,000 square feet and the mark-to-market was over 60% on a gross basis and over 100% on a net basis. None of these transactions are in our same-store stats for the quarter. We are now actively engaged on over 350,000 square feet of full floor tenants, including the five currently vacant floors, a 117,000 square feet of vacancy with an average starting rent on those floors of over $80 a square foot. The largest tenant is only 51,000 square feet. The anticipated rollup is in excess of 50% on a gross basis and over 75% on a net basis on all of that space. In total, we have over 1 million square feet of near-term lease expirations and vacancy with an average rent of $53 a square foot at EC. At 535, we are now 91% leased and we have leases out on all but 4,000 square feet. The last three deals were a foundation and insurance company and a law firm. The building should be fully contributing by the third quarter of \u201816 at a cash return of over 7.8%, 150 basis points greater than our original performance. We have 700,000 square feet of available space at Salesforce Tower. Currently, we have leases out on 100,000 square feet totaling 4.5 floors. We have active or multi-floor discussions defined as multiple letters of intent being exchanged proceeding with asset managers, hedge funds, VCs, law firms, consulting firms, real estate brokerage companies and other non-tech service firms that encompass more than 475,000 square feet. Only two of these tenants are existing customers at Embarcadero Center. These requirements are all lease expiration driven for occupancy at the end of 2017 or early 2018. In summary, activity at Salesforce Tower and the rest of our city portfolio is robust as much as we had seen since we bought the property in Embarcadero Center back in 1998. With that, I will turn the call over to Mike. Mike LaBelle : Thanks Doug. Good morning everybody. I am going to briefly cover our earnings for the quarter and projections for the rest of the year, but we will focus my comments primarily on our 2016 guidance that we provided. I would also like to point out that we added a new page to our supplemental report this quarter that provides our key earnings guidance assumptions. We are hopeful that this in conjunction with the guidance explanations that we have historically included within our earnings press release is helpful. Starting with our quarterly results, as you can see from our press release, we reported third quarter FFO of $1.41 per share. That was $0.06 per share, about $11 million above the midpoint of our guidance. The results included unbudgeted lease termination fees of $5.6 million. This includes the $3.6 million payment we received related to our Lehman Brothers bankruptcy claim. So far this year, we have collected over $8 million from our claim, which we believe has the remaining value of about $2.5 million, though we don\u2019t know when or if we will collect it. We also recorded $2 million of termination fees for taking back a floor from a tenant at 601 Lexington Avenue that Doug mentioned. The remaining $5.4 million of our earnings beat included $900,000 of better than protected service fee income and $4.5 million from the portfolio. In our portfolio, our operating expenses were about $1.5 million below our budget, all of which we expect to incur in the fourth quarter. And we delivered two developments this quarter earlier than we expected resulting in $3 million of portfolio outperformance. We projected both of these developments to deliver on October 1. So there is no impact on our fourth quarter projections. Our projections for the fourth quarter are generally in line with our prior guidance. The only meaningful changes are that we will benefit from the early acquisition of Fountain Square that will add about \u2013 it will add about $2 million for the quarter. However, we projected to be offset by operating expenses being moved from the third quarter to the fourth quarter and the loss of income from terminated tenants. For the full year 2015, we are projecting funds from operations of $5.46 to $5.48 per share. Again, this represents an increase from our guidance last quarter of $0.06 per share at the midpoint reflecting the outperformance we recorded in the third quarter. Now, I would like to spend a few minutes on 2016. Last quarter, we discussed a few larger items that would impact our 2015 earnings, including asset sales, in particular the sale of 7 Cambridge Center to its user The Broad Institute, which will result in the loss of $13.2 million of NOI. The Broad Institute is a unique situation given that they negotiated this purchase rate as part of the build to suit development 12 years ago. And the rent contained two components, a base rent which was used to calculate the purchase price and a large tenant improvement investment that was fully amortized over the term of the lease of additional rent. We do not have any other tenant purchase rights like this in our portfolio. The impact of this and our 2015 sales are partially offset by the acquisition of Fountain Square. But in aggregate we project a $16 million or $0.09 per share decline in 2016 NOI from 2015 related to net sales activity. Last quarter, we also discussed the impacts on 2016 from downtime in between leases for some larger lease expirations such as Citibank vacating 140,000 square feet at 601 Lexington Avenue, FAO vacating at 767 Fifth Avenue and lease expirations at our Gateway project in South San Francisco, 100 Federal Street in Boston and in our Washington, DC buildings. This has tempered our same-store growth for 2016, but will be more than offset by growth in the remainder of our same-property portfolio and incremental NOI from the delivery of a portion of our development pipeline. In Boston, we project occupancy gains at the Prudential Tower, 200 Clarendon Street and our Suburban Waltham buildings. We also will reopen the Boylston Street side of the shops at the Prudential Center in the second half of 2016, including Eataly and the completion of the retail expansion, which is 100% leased. This income will start to show up in the second half of 2016 and will be fully in place in 2017. As Doug mentioned, we have good activity in New York City at 250 West 55th Street and expect stabilization in 2016. Year-over-year, we project 250 West 55th Street to contribute an incremental $15 million to $20 million of NOI in 2016. We are also projecting incremental income gains at 599 Lexington Avenue and in Princeton. Doug also described the activity at Embarcadero Center. The potential revenue from the five vacant floors he mentioned is over $9 million and our anticipated rollout from expiring leases through 2017 is over $20 million. Some of this is projected to commence in 2016. Overall, we project our average occupancy remaining relatively stable between 90% and 92% during 2016 and then improving with positive absorption in 2017. On a GAAP basis, at the midpoint of our 2016 guidance, we project our same-property NOI to be relatively flat compared to 2015. The most significant headwinds are at 601 Lexington Avenue, 100 Federal Street and 757 Fifth Avenue, each of which is a consolidated joint venture. If you include only our share, our 2016 same-property GAAP NOI performance improves by 100 basis points. On a cash basis, our same-property projections are much better. We have a significant amount of free rent burning off at 680 Folsom Street, 250 West 55th Street, 101 Huntington Avenue and South of Market. And also, we will experience the cash impact of the rollup in rents from early renewals we completed in Cambridge and in San Francisco. We project our cash same-property NOI for 2016 to be up by 1.5% to 3.5% from 2015. Again, if you only include our share of consolidated joint ventures, this growth goes up by approximately 100 basis points. So cash NOI growth of 2.5% to 4.5%. Properties not included in the same-property portfolio include our 2015 and 2016 development deliveries. These developments represent a total investment of $1.1 billion and are projected to provide an aggregate averaged unleveraged, stabilized cash return of 7.75%. We project an incremental NOI contribution to 2016 from these properties of $34 million to $40 million and growing to over $70 million by the end of 2017. Non-cash rents, including both straight-line rent and fair value rents will be down significantly in 2016, as much of it will convert to cash rents. We project our non-cash rents to be $30 million to $50 million in 2016. That compares to our current 2015 projection of $90 million to $95 million.  We have four maturing mortgages in 2016 that total $580 million and we project interest expense savings of $8 million assuming we complete a $500 million financing in the fourth quarter of 2016. This is baked into our interest assumptions for the year and we currently project interest expense of $400 million to $420 million for 2016. This is net of capitalized interest associated with our development pipeline of $38 million to $48 million. We have not made any other financing assumptions, though we continue to monitor the market in advance of our $3.6 billion of aggregate debt expiring in 2016 and 2017. We continuously evaluate the costs associated with an early refinancing, which could occur later this year or in early 2016. Any transaction would result in a significant prepayment penalty there will be a charge to earnings in the period we complete the refinancing. We also continue to layer in forward starting fixed rate hedges targeting a corporate financing in late 2016 and our $1.6 billion loans on 767 Fifth Avenue that expires in late 2017. With our acquisition of our partner\u2019s share of Fountain Square and the sale of 505 Ninth Street combined with transition between leases and some of our consolidated joint ventures, we project the FFO deduction for non-controlling interest in property partnerships to be lower in 2016 at $95 million to $115 million. So overall, we project 2016 funds from operation of $5.50 to $5.70 per share. At the midpoint of our guidance, we are $0.13 per share higher than 2015, which reflects approximately $0.22 and growth from our development deliveries, $0.10 and growth from our share of portfolio NOI, $0.08 of lower interest expense, offset by $0.09 of dilution from asset sales, $0.04 from higher G&A expense and $0.14 of lower termination income. The dilution from selling assets in 2015 has an impact on our 2016 growth profile. If you exclude the impact from asset sales, our FFO growth at the midpoint will be approximately 4% even with some of the transition we are seeing in the portfolio. Our portfolio was well-positioned for additional growth beyond 2016 and we anticipate improving our occupancy, adding incremental NOI from the existing portfolio and from our development investments. That completes our formal remarks. Operator, if you can open the line up for questions that will be great. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Guinee from Stifel. Your line is open. John Guinee : John Guinee here. Thank you very much. First, a couple of questions for Owen and then one for Ray Ritchey or maybe this is Doug. Back in 2010 or 2011, Princeton Corporate Center came on, you sold it, you backed out what are your thoughts on Princeton Corporate Center these days? Owen Thomas : Well, it\u2019s called \u2013 we call it Carnegie Center, John. John Guinee : I am sorry. Owen Thomas : That\u2019s alright. And I think the basic fundamental philosophy down there is that we have been able to find the real niche with the pharma, biotech and some other industrial companies, many of whom are growing and we have been able to both capture additional occupancy, as well as additional users where we are building a building as an example for NRG right now and our plans are, at the moment to continue to have a thriving 2.5 million square foot campus, where we have growing tenants though where we hope to see rising rents and we can accommodate future growth. John Guinee : Okay, great. Ray Ritchey, you are deep in the teeth of the GSA deals, your TSA lease. Can you kind of talk through whether we are in the first inning of the GSA movement or are we halfway through? And how many more feet are you going to see GSA move into state-of-the-art metro-centric buildings in the near term? Ray Ritchey : Thanks, John. First of all, in TSA, obviously we are involved in a protest there. So, it\u2019s like we will not comment on that except to say that we would not file the protest, if not we didn\u2019t feel good about our position. Number two on GSA in general, you may have saw where DOJ just signed a lease for over 800,000 square feet on a to-be-built complex here in the NoMa District of Washington, and I think that\u2019s indicative of the fact that current landlords or existing landlords have a hard time meeting the space allocation needs. And that these larger requirements more likely than not will be forcing new development. And as we control several sites that would be responsive that we are encouraged that that maybe the case. Having said that, we are still aggressively pursuing renewals at a number of our buildings where leases expire in \u201816 and \u201817 and because of the strategic nature of those specific buildings, we feel really great about the renewal prospects for our buildings. John Guinee : Great. And Owen, are you going to be running with us Wednesday morning at NAREIT? Owen Thomas : Looking forward to it. Thank you. John Guinee : Alright, thanks a lot, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman from Citi. Your line is open. Manny Korchman : Good morning, guys. In your remarks on sales force, you spoke about the non-tech sort of demands from users. What are you seeing on the tech demand side of things? Has the sales force sort of naming rights been an issue or are you seeing larger source of requirements than you thought you would when you built that? Owen Thomas : I think what we are seeing is exactly what we would have anticipated seeing with regards to the building. This building is in the premier office address in San Francisco at this point. And given the relatively higher rents that we are asking relative to other parts of the city and other properties, we anticipate that the market demand would be geared towards the financial services companies with lease expirations driven occupancy needs. And so I think we are seeing exactly what we would have expected to see. Manny Korchman : Doug, while I have got you on the line, FAO, you mentioned perhaps a single user, perhaps multiple users do you have an appetite one way or the other? Doug Linde : I think our appetite is to maximize the revenue and maintain the image of the building. And if it comes in the form of two or three transactions, that\u2019s okay and if the right brand awareness organization wants the whole 65,000 square feet and they are prepared to pay what we consider a fair rent, we will do deal with them as well. Manny Korchman : Great. One quick one for Mike, Mike, what\u2019s driving the big G&A ramp next year? Mike LaBelle : I am sorry, what was that? Manny Korchman : What\u2019s driving the new G&A ramp into \u201816? Mike LaBelle : So, on our G&A, we have really just assumed cost of living adjustments on our 2015 general G&A. And then we do have a long-term compensation plan that is identical to the plan that we had in \u201815 that is in there and the difference is that the plan that is rolling off from \u201813, the unvested piece of that is just less than the charge for the first year for the plan that is projected for \u201816, but that plan is identical \u2013 projected to be identical to what the plan we had in \u201815 is. There is really two pieces. Manny Korchman : Alright. Thanks guys. Mike LaBelle : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jed Reagan from Green Street Advisors. Your line is open. Jed Reagan : Good morning, guys. Owen, you mentioned that asset prices maybe tested this fall. And I am just hoping you guys maybe elaborate a little bit on that statement and just what dynamics you see it play there and do you think there are certain of your markets that might be more vulnerable than others? Owen Thomas : Yes. So, we have had as you know now several quarters/years of I would say very strong capital market conditions, particularly for Class A assets. And from all the evidence that we have of deals that we are involved in and deals that we watch, that market conditions still exists. However, I made the comment, because there have been a few new things that have happened over the last quarter. We had some clear market volatility, downdraft in the equity markets in August, which is now recovered, but clearly the volatility levels are higher. I am sure that\u2019s had impact on some investors. We are closer to the end of the year. So, everyone has got a different belief on what interest rates are going to go, but we are closer to a possible December rate hike. And then lastly and anecdotally, a lot of what we see and what we hear from the industry, there is a significant pipeline of assets for sale, both office assets and other asset classes currently in the market. So, I just make the point, again, we have no specific deal evidence of change, but there are a few of these moving currents, which could have some impact on it and we will have to see. Jed Reagan : Any evidence\u2026 Doug Linde : Yes, I think the \u2013 I don\u2019t think there is anything in my remarks that are targeted towards any one specific market. I think we have mentioned before, the asset \u2013 attractive asset pricing that we are seeing exists across all of our four markets. And these factors that I mentioned, I think would have impact on all of them. Jed Reagan : Okay and so no evidence yet of bidding 10 smaller or maybe overseas buyers taking a step back? Doug Linde : Not specific, no. Jed Reagan : Okay. And also your stock has been trading at a pretty wide discount to NAV here recently. And I am just curious whether share buybacks are on your radar at this point and just how you are thinking about that option versus say new developments? Owen Thomas : We have obviously been watching our stock price, Jed and we talk about it and we have even addressed it with kind of our board and talked about it. And our view is that we have got a great use of capital for our developments. If you look at our liquidity and you look at our capacity, which is actually significant given our leverage, we certainly have capacity, but then you look at the impact, the accretion impact of doing a share buyback of $1 billion or $1.5 billion or even $2 billion and it\u2019s not that meaningful to us given the fact that we think we are going to have alternative investment opportunities and continue to have new development given our shadow pipeline over the next few years. So, we don\u2019t want to give up that capacity for some sort of short-term gain when we have great opportunity in the future. Jed Reagan : Okay, it sounds good. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman from Bank of America. Your line is open. Jamie Feldman : Great, thank you. So, you have done a good job of laying out the $80 million of potential NOI upside through year end \u201817 and provide advice on this in the past. And just listen to your comments, it does sound like maybe there is some 2017 NOI that might be moving out. So, I guess my question is two parts. Number one, can you just bring us up to speed on, of the $80 million, how much of that is in the bag? And number two, when we think about that $80 million, is there some movement in \u201817 that might be a drag again? Doug Linde : Jamie, this is Doug. So, it\u2019s hard for me to sort of describe what is in the bag or not in the bag. I mean, as an example, I described and might put some numbers around all of the rollover that we have in Embarcadero Center. And I also \u2013 I put some perspective on the activity we have in Boston and we have previously talked about what\u2019s going on at 100 Federal Street. All of that, I think is activity that we are confident is going to progress in the appropriate manner, but none of it is \u201cin the bag\u201d. But I \u2013 we feel pretty good about it. With regards to \u201817 and interestingly I actually went through and looked at our entire portfolio from 2017 to 2020, because I figured somebody \u2013 someone might ask if there are any other really large rollovers in our portfolio. And in \u201817, aside from the square footage that I described at 399 and I think I gave some clarity on the fact that much of that space is likely to going to be leased prior to those leases expiring. In fact we may get some leases done in early 2016 on that space. I think that we are feeling relatively comfortable that, that space is not going to be a drag on our earnings on a going forward basis. And then when you skip until the 2018 and we have space at $45 a square foot, a big chunk in Cambridge that\u2019s rolling over. I wish we can have the space back today, so I can lease it today. Then in 2020, we have the Estee Lauder space at the General Motors building 757 Fifth that\u2019s just going to rollover, which has got an enormous amount of embedded upside in it. So on a going-forward basis, while I think we will continue to see downtime between major lease expirations, it\u2019s nothing like what we are seeing at the moment where we have the concurrence of both the assets in Boston at 200 Clarendon Street, 120 St. James, changes at 100 Federal Street, what we are doing at 601 and what\u2019s going on particularly with the retail space at General Motors building all happening within the same 12-month period of time. Jamie Feldman : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then \u2013 so I guess to your comment, you feel very comfortable on some of it, can you quantify of the $80 million, how much is that? Doug Linde : I will be able to quantify it in future quarters. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then turning to Mike, do you have a sense of what your guidance means through 2016 FAD? Mike LaBelle : Well. Yes. I mean obviously, I had some comments there relative to our same-store cash being higher. And I made some comments on what our free rent and straight line rent is going to be which is significantly lower than it\u2019s going to be in 2015. The other thing I would point out is we have done a lot of leasing in 2015 that has \u2013 in \u201915 and that was just a lot of this early renewals and take-backs and deals that we did. So the leasing transaction costs that we are seeing in 2015, I think are higher than what they have been historically because there has been so much volume of leasing. So as I look at our occupancy projections and I look at 2016, I mean I am looking at probably doing 3.5 to 3.7 million square feet of leasing in order to achieve our projection. So you can throw whatever transaction costs you need to throw at that based upon some renewals, some being new. But if you use $45 or $50 a square foot, you are talking about $160 million, $170 million. And then we talked about our cash rents and our CapEx, I would expect it to be similar next year to this year. We expect this year to be somewhere in the $70 million range, I would expect that to be similar. We do have some more significant work going on like this year we had Hancock lobby and we have started the 599 lobby and the elevator work at 599 and that\u2019s going to go also into next year. And we will do some work at 399 next year and some other buildings. But overall, I mean I would see it being an FAD of somewhere around $4 somewhere $3.80 to $4.20, something like that per share, which is higher than this year by probably 10% to 15%. Jamie Feldman : Okay, great. And then just final question, you mentioned a good pipeline of leasing for Salesforce Tower. And I know you have said in the past that tenants in those markets tend wait closer to occupancy date to sign leases, what\u2019s realistic in terms of what we should thinking about for when you start to put some more leasing on the board there? Doug Linde : Well, as I said we have 4.5 floors that we are currently in lease negotiations. That means we have sent a lease and they have sent comments back and we sent comments back to that. And I would expect that that 4.5 floors we will be done close to the end of the year, maybe before the end of the year. And then we have got proposals that we are trading back and forth with a multitude of tenants, so I said 475,000 square feet. Do I think we are going to have any of those physically leased before the end of the year given that it\u2019s November 1 on Monday or November 3 on Monday, probably not, because it generally takes 90 days to 120 days to sign a lease unless there is a crucial need for delivery of the space sooner than that. And obviously we are not going to deliver the space until early 2017. But we think we are going to have consistent theories of leases to announce in the first \u2013 in the second quarter of next year or with all the work that we have going on right now. And Bob, I don\u2019t know if you want to comment on that? Bob Pester : I will just go on a limb and say that we will be 100% leased when the building is completed. Jamie Feldman : Alright. Thank you. Arista Joyner : Operator? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum of UBS Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ross Nussbaum : Thanks. Good morning. I am just trying to get over that last bold statement there. While we are on a bold statement in San Fran, can we talk about the status of your potential development at Fourth and Harrison? Owen Thomas : Sure, I will give a couple of brief remarks and then I will let Bob describe it. So we purchased an option or we entered into an option agreement on Fourth and Harrison and we have done our \u2013 we made our preliminary submission for the city and there area a series of entitlements. And I will let Bob describe them in more detail that need to be garnered in order to start that project. One of them is referred to as the Central SoMa plan, the other one is a Prop M allocation. And Bob you can describe sort of the timeframes associated with going to that process. Bob Pester : So the Central SoMa plan is an area that affects from Market Street, south of the freeway and our Fourth and Harrison properties included in it. It\u2019s anticipated that plan will be approved sometime next year, it was supposed to be this year, so it could potentially drag on. Prop M is probably the bigger factor that affects us because there is a 10 million square foot pipeline of planned projects. And we are one of those projects that are going have to compete for that square footage until Prop M either gets voted out or some other type of solutions realized. We just submitted our preplanning application a couple of weeks ago. We have got a meeting with Citi in two weeks to review the plan that were very preliminary as far as going through the planning process. And at this point, we really aren\u2019t certain what\u2019s going to be approved or have to change with the project, but we will keep you posted as it materializes over the next couple of months. Ross Nussbaum : Okay. I appreciate that. Shifting over to New York, can you remind me on the rework development over \u2013 across the river, is that a fixed rent deal with bumps or do you guys have any kind of a profit-sharing arrangement like some other landlords have done? Doug Linde : It\u2019s called Dock72 for future reference and John Powers, I will let you describe our arrangement without talking about the specifics. John Powers : No, there\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a straight lease for 240,000 square feet. It does have increases in the lease over the 20-year period. There\u2019s no percentage of profits or any \u2013 anything else. Ross Nussbaum : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of from the line of Brendan Maiorana from Wells Fargo. Go ahead. Your line is open? Brendan Maiorana : Good morning. So Mike, probably for Mike LaBelle, so your same-store cash NOI growth that you shared, 2.5% to 4.5% seems many fully higher than these bare our expectation was an you talk last quarter about some of the pro-active space that you are taking back, which, I think, in aggregate, you said maybe hurt the \u201816 in run rate by about 200 basis points. Is that still the case or is maybe some of that drag that you initially expected in \u201816 not going to show up? Mike LaBelle : No, that $34 million of drag is still expected. Again the cash growth is coming from 101 Huntington Avenue. We did the lease with Blue Cross Blue Shield, had pre-rented it in 2015 and a little bit of cash rent, full cash rent in 2016. That\u2019s a big lease. The leases at 250 West 55th Street and 680 Fulsom all had a lot of free rent during 2015, no free rent in 2016. And then the renewals, I mean, in Cambridge we did three big renewals in 2014 and 2015 where we increased rents from $45 to $70 plus. And the bump in the cash doesn\u2019t come until the natural lease expiration of those leases, which was in 2016. And same thing in San Francisco with some of the early deals that we did on some of the firms in Embarcadero Center and it just has a meaningful impact on the cash flows and the growth in them. So, that\u2019s really where it\u2019s coming from. Brendan Maiorana : Okay, great. And then with respect to the $80 million of growth kind of by the end of \u201817, my recollection from the slides that you guys have provided is that there were some of those assets, which are actually what we are talking about a little bit of a drag in \u201816 and then become growth thereafter. Is there, on a net basis, is any of the $80 million really positively contributing to \u201816 or is that really kind of \u201817 and thereafter growth? Doug Linde : Some of that will be \u2013 will start to commence in \u201816. So, as an example, if we lease 5 vacant floors of Embarcadero Center rent at $80 a square foot, I think Mike said it was $9.5 million and if per chance all of those leases commenced in August of 2016. We get the bump in 2016 and it would obviously be there for \u201817 as well. So, the $80 million is the totality of the incremental cash flows and some of it will be occurring earlier than the end of \u201817. Brendan Maiorana : Okay, great. And then just last one to your occupancy guidance, 90% to 92% is about \u2013 the midpoint of that 91% is about in line with where you are today. Is there any major trend in terms of how occupancies likely to migrate throughout the year, is it expected to be roughly flattish? Ray Ritchey : We have got rollover at the end of the year with Gateway. We have got the rollover at 601. So, my anticipation is that it will go down at the beginning of the year and then it will grow through the years. So, we could be sub-91% at the end of the year, beginning of the year and then kind of grow up closer to 92% through towards the end of the year. Brendan Maiorana : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson from Morgan Stanley. Go ahead. Your line is open. Vance Edelson : Good morning. First on Innovation Place, it sounds like a lot of future lease up in development potential ahead, which will partially take part in, but could you just walk us through the thought process in handing the reins over and is there any gain on sale there? Thanks. Owen Thomas : The thought process of the sale was that was the preference of our clients. And in my comments, I mentioned a gain, which I think is $78 million. Mike LaBelle : Yes, that\u2019s also in our guidance for net income. There is the GAAP gain within the guidance for net income and our guidance that we provided. So, there is a GAAP gain and there is also a tax gain. Vance Edelson : Okay, perfect. And then it sounds like you have got some good prospects for a permanent solution on the FAO space. Could you give us a feel for the potential NOI upside ballpark when you feel that retail space if it works out the way you want versus the current temporary tenant and versus when FAO was there and could maintaining the buildings image as you mentioned could that weigh on revenues significantly? Doug Linde : So, I am going to \u2013 this is not going to \u2013 to be very satisfactory, but given that we are talking to specific tenants, I just don\u2019t feel comfortable front-running what we might charge any particular tenant for the space. I can tell you that the contribution from that 65,000 square feet was in and around $20 million prior to the termination of the lease and we plan on significantly surpassing that number. And I don\u2019t want to \u2013 I mean, you are not going to be able to get me to say what significantly is defined as, but you are aware of what other space rents for on Fifth Avenue. And as I said before, our advantage is that we probably have one of the most highly trafficked plazas on the Avenue, particularly with the Apple Store and the demand that it generates the little bit of a challenges that we have at plaza. So, the storefront is not right out on the street, which has its benefits and its disadvantages. And so we have to work through all of that with the various tenants that we are discussing on the space with. Vance Edelson : Okay, got it. And then just looking at the development pipeline, it\u2019s still largely office, but the two groundbreakings during the quarter were resi where you are getting 6% yields versus say 7.5% on the office side. Should we expect more of the same going forward with new projects more in that lower yield bucket and then what are the other considerations there as you think about the capital deployment? Doug Linde : Well, I think that if we do more residential projects, I think that we would anticipate that the yields will be in the similar ballpark when we are doing office buildings and we are generally trying to generate cash-on-cash returns in excess of 7% as I described the deals that are coming online in \u201817 for a full contribution will be in excess of 8%. So, I think that, that is our goal and that is what our mission is obviously depending upon the particular site and the particular structure of the lease and who the tenant is, it can be varied. Vance Edelson : Got it. Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Kim from BMO Capital. Go ahead. Your line is open. John Kim : Thank you. Doug, you provided the diversity of tenants actively looking at Salesforce Tower, I was wondering if you could do the same for Embarcadero Centre and if there is any potential to attract tech tenants there? Doug Linde : So, the Embarcadero Center activity is primarily at the moment in terms of the full floors, asset manager, money manager and law firms. And interestingly, one of the fundamental things that we are discovering is that as much as people like to and want to sort of redo their space, the cost of re-tenanting space is astronomically high and it\u2019s getting higher in these markets both through construction cost increases from inflation as well as the demand of labor. And so the installations that have previously been built have \u2013 in fact have some utilities. And so we have, for example, law firms that are looking at some of that Bingham McCutchen, now Morgan Lewis space and saying we can figure out ways to make use of this space and instead of having spent $140 a square foot when we have to spend $85 or $90 a square foot. On the tech side, we actually are seeing some amount of tech looking at Embarcadero Center and I think honesty largely it\u2019s because there is so little available space now in the south of a market location that tenants are sort of looking for blocks of space wherever they can find it. And we will have some small blocks of space and we continue to be a very viable alternative for those types of users. And Bob, I don\u2019t know if you want to make any additional comments? Bob Pester : No, I think you pretty much covered what\u2019s happening in Embarcadero Center. We have done a few tech deals here, but nothing of significance. We have had some tech tenants like Microsoft look here that landed elsewhere. And I would agree with Doug as the market gets tighter, we will probably see more of them. John Kim : In the similar vein, you have WeWork in a couple of your developments, do you see them backfilling any of your near-term expirations? Doug Linde : I think WeWork is an important user of space in all of our markets and to the extent that it makes sense for their business model and it makes sense for how we are marketing and leasing our space for us to come together. We will consider those opportunities. John Kim : I had a question on the special dividends I think you mentioned that it would likely get paid. What is the scenario in which it wouldn\u2019t be paid? Are you in any late stage of any acquisitions that you are looking at? Doug Linde : As we mentioned in prior years, we and the board will make that decision at year end based on our net income. We did provide the gain associated with the sales to try to help you understand what the potential for that could be. I did mention that we don\u2019t contemplate having any additional sales for this year. And I also mentioned that the acquisition environment continued to be challenging, but the final \u2013 any dividend and the amount of any dividend won\u2019t be finalized until later in the year. John Kim : Okay. And then finally, Owen, maybe can you provide some commentary on Brookfield\u2019s joint venture with the Qatar Investment Authority at Manhattan West this week? Any implications for office pricing or sovereign wealth funds\u2019 appetite for development risk? Owen Thomas : Well, I think it\u2019s another indication as we were talking about earlier of the interest in both offshore and we also see interest from offshore investors, but I think it\u2019s another example of offshore investors being very interested in high-quality U.S. real estate in core markets. And I think that there is also I think increasingly \u2013 increasing interest on some sovereign wealth part \u2013 some funds part not on all and moving up somewhat in the risk curve and trying to achieve higher return while we are taking the risk and I think this investment like Qatar in that project is an example of it. John Kim : Did the pricing surprise you at all? Owen Thomas : Honestly, I don\u2019t know that much about the pricing. John Kim : Got it, okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brad Burke from Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, your line is open. Brad Burke : Hi, good morning. I was hoping you can give us some coder on how should we think about the magnitude of the podium project at North Station since it sounds like that might be a near-term start and since you will be capitalizing interest in G&A on that and any other projects that come out of the shadow pipeline, I was wondering what the guidance contemplates if anything, in the way of new incremental development for capitalized interested in G&A? Doug Linde : So the podium project is approximately $285 million. Right now, we are assuming that Delaware North if he started we will go forward with it, so obviously it would be half of that. And we also assume that if we have Delaware North as a partner that we will put some additional third party financing on it. So that\u2019s sort of the magnitude of that. And then next piece would be the residential and hotel sites, which are pretty integral to one-half of the building. And then the last piece of the Office Tower, which is I think is the longest lead item from our perspective because it\u2019s more tenant specific. And I think we will have a better sense of where Delaware North is on those two projects in the next quarter. And as Owen said, when we talk to you in I guess early January or late January we will have more flesh to put on the bone. Mike LaBelle : We have not included the starts of these. They don\u2019t have a significant impact on our earnings, I mean there could be some additional capitalized interest that is not currently in our model and our guidance for this, if there is whatever dollars are spend out it could improve our interest expense a little bit because our capitalized interests might be a little bit higher, if we were to start that project. Brad Burke : Okay. And then just an update because you continue to push and development, just what you are seeing at construction costs in the market and how you are thinking right now about the rest of the construction costs maybe take a big step up from where they are at currently? Owen Thomas : So I think I have said this previously and it will be a consistent message, which is as a little inflation as the Fed is and others are seeing in parts of the consumer economy. Construction market in San Francisco, Boston, Washington, DC and New York is seeing significant inflation defined as right now somewhere around 6% plus per year. And so we are doing everything we can to make deals and do our bidding sooner rather than later and do buyouts on long-term lead items and get our drawings in a position where we can do that thoughtfully as quickly as possible. And we build all of that inflation into the budgets that we provide you. So a budget that for a building that\u2019s going to commence in 2016 or \u201817 will have built in inflationary creep in the hard cost numbers to take care of what we consider to be a reality of the market today. Brad Burke : Okay. So that 6% or so number is what we should think about you guys underwriting for cost inflation? Owen Thomas : Yes. Brad Burke : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Auerbach from Credit Suisse. Go ahead, your line is open. Ian Weissman : Good morning it\u2019s actually Ian Weissman here. Just a couple of questions, as I listen to you comments about San Francisco and a way that also what Kilroy is saying about the continued stringing in that market, I was wondering if you can help us understand as you guys think about leading indicators for demand, what should we be focused on, a lot of times people focus on sub-leased space, but how do you think about lack of IPOs this cycle or growth space or private market valuations? Owen Thomas : So Ian, my comment to you would be as follows, which is I think the thing that we first look at is we look at the amount of venture capital led investment that\u2019s occurring in the various markets in the country and how that measures vis-\u00e0-vis the last four quarters or five quarters in years and what it sort of looks like historically and because that sort of where a lot of it starts particularly on the tech side. And then we expect that there will be failures that the changes that are occurring in the technology space and the number of entrants into various product categories are not single. And so as an example, in the mobile payment system, there are five or six tech companies that have all either attempted to go public or are moving towards that direction and have aligned themselves with other tech companies. And in my opinion, they are not all going to be successful, right. So Samsung has their own pay, Apple Pay is out there, PayPal is out there, Visa has a product, Square has a product, they can\u2019t all possibly be on every mobile payment service in every retailer in the country because it\u2019s just too many of them. And so we anticipate that there are going to be failures. And so when we look at things like layoff at Twitter or other blowups, on a one-off basis those are the types of things that don\u2019t worry us. Where we start to see significant layoff due to global economic concerns and major changes in what\u2019s going on from a GDP perspective, that\u2019s where I think we would start to feel really uncomfortable about the demand characteristics of that particular marketplace. And it\u2019s really hard to sort of see with the canary in the coal mine is on that in the current environment. I would just add to that. Look, I think there are metrics that we can all look at. I think the venture capital investing historically versus rents is certainly an interesting one. But I think we also rely heavily on what just what is our expense on a day-to-day basis in the marketplace. I mean given the portfolio that we have and the insights that we have and what\u2019s going on in the market, we have watched with some wonder over the last couple of weeks, all of the negative press and commentary about the San Francisco market when our actual experience is completely inverse of it as Doug and Bob described. Ian Weissman : That\u2019s helpful. Just two other questions, as you think about your non-core, I should say asset sales next year, can you maybe help us understand a little bit better or walk us through what some of those low-growth assets are or maybe by market? Owen Thomas : Look, we will continuously be evaluating our portfolio for assets that would be in non-core areas. Some examples of that that we \u2013 of assets like that, that we have sold over the last few years have been some of our Suburban Boston, outside of the Waltham assets, some of our suburban Maryland assets. We \u2013 to sell, we not only we have to determine if they are non-core, but they also have to be leased at a level and has to be a strong enough capital market where we feel like we are getting an attractive price to exit. So what we are going \u2013 what we did at this year and what we are going continue do in \u201816 is to continue to look at those assets, see what the leasing status is, see what the market conditions are and see if we have an opportunity to sell those assets at an attractive level for shareholders. Ian Weissman : That\u2019s great. And finally, this might be a tough question to answer as we sit here in 2015, but Owen you said that \u201817 could be a year where we can experience or you guys can experience meaningful growth, can you kind of just put some parameters on that for investors? Owen Thomas : Well, what we have tried to do following on our last call was to put out a slide in our recent Investor Relation materials and also, Doug and I and Mike spent a fair amount of time trying to describe it today. We are obviously not putting out \u201817 numbers, but what we tried to do is say for these \u2013 for a select group of assets that are again shown in the slide in our IR material, we think that the same-store NOI for those assets. And these are the ones that are \u2013 many of them are experiencing a downdraft and then an updraft. But for those assets, we see an $80 million increase in same property NOI from \u201815 to 2017. And then we also wanted to point out as we have been describing and as you have discussed, we have a very active development pipeline and portfolio. And if you do the math on that, with our projections, we believe that we will add an additional $72 million in annualized NOI from our development portfolio by the end of 2017. So, those are the numbers that we are using now to hopefully give you some feel for what 2017 could look like albeit I recognize it\u2019s an incomplete picture. Ian Weissman : I appreciate that color. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O\u2019Neill. Go ahead. Your line is open. Alexander Goldfarb : Great, thank you very much. Just two questions for me. The first one is for Ray Ritchey, now that you guys have bought out Beacon on Fountain Square and consolidated all the Reston Town Center, does this allow you to accelerate some of your redevelopment plans or regardless of whether you owned it in a partnership or not it doesn\u2019t change the timeline with regards to future redevelopment? Ray Ritchey : Thanks, Alex. The original density of additional development pad in the Town Center per se was acquired where we bought the first space 2.5 years ago. And we have been going the last two years to position that asset for development and it\u2019s really a two-phase asset. The first as we talked about today is the 508 and the 20,000 square feet of commercial space, 508 units of residential, but we are also working on another office tower that will be approximately 270,000 square feet and we are taking steps to put that in position as well. And then of course, we still have the Gateway side, which has the potential of upwards of 3 million to 3.5 million square feet of space in mixed use development that will be forthcoming when Metro comes. So, Reston is great today, it will be even greater in the future. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then heading out West, the innovation and the sale of Broadcom, can you just help us put some parameters around the pricing? With the all-in additional rights, it looks like it\u2019s about $190 a foot. So, if you can just give us some perspective on your thoughts to sell versus keep it and do that development for your own account? Owen Thomas : As I mentioned earlier, another question came up about that. It was the preference of the client to purchase the site and own the buildings versus us continuing to own the buildings and lease them. So that was the driver. Doug Linde : So, Alex, first of all, we didn\u2019t say who the tenant is, so those are your words not ours for the record. So, when we think about that site in North San Jose, which is Mountain View in North San Jose and Sunnydale and Santa Clara all are very different types of markets. The net rent that you would achieve today on 1980s vintage building is somewhere around $2 a square foot. And so you can sort of back into what the economics might be on leasing the space recognizing that in order to lease those buildings there needs to be tenant improvements and brokerage commissions on all sort of things. And then, obviously, while we have been able to and very thoughtfully create additional density there. In order to do that, there has to be a change in the configuration of the way the parking is currently operated, i.e., there needs to be structured parking garages. And it\u2019s not a paid parking type of a situation. So, you also have to consider what the costs are of replicating the parking for the existing buildings as you build the additional 500 plus thousand square feet of density and what the cost of that is. So, all of those things factored into the pricing that we think was a strong price, a fair price for both us as the owner and for our potential user. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay, thanks a lot, Doug. Doug Linde : And I just want to reiterate what I said earlier is how pleased we are with this transaction given the price, given the vacancy that we will not be experiencing in the company and the new client relationship that we have in the development assignment. So, we think it\u2019s a terrific transaction for the company and for shareholders. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Go ahead. Your line is open. Vincent Chao : Hey, good morning, everyone. I actually thought I had jumped out of queue here. Most of the questions have been answered, but I guess just going back to the free rent conversation, you mentioned a number of leases that are going to have some burn off here in \u201816, but I guess can you just tell us what the dollar amount of free rent is in the third quarter numbers and what that looks like? Because I guess the issue with a straight line rent guidance you provided is that, that would include some additional free rent and straight line rent for new leasing activity, I think. So, just curious what level of free rent is actually coming off in \u201816 that\u2019s in the third quarter numbers? Mike LaBelle : Well, third quarter numbers for non-cash rents, about $18 million, $19 million. And again, for the full year, it\u2019s $90 million to $95 million. It started off around $30 million in the first quarter and it\u2019s tailed down. I expect the fourth quarter to be kind of comparable to where the third quarter is. And then the 2016 numbers will be significantly lower than that. And it is a combination of some fair value rent going down as well as some straight line rent going down, it\u2019s both of those things. But the big pieces I mentioned we are in the pre-rent piece, the fair value pieces, there is some 767 Fifth and Hancock, where we saw some rollovers occur in \u201815 and also in \u201816 with 767 Fifth, where you are going to see that come off and it\u2019s just going to be greater in \u201815 than in \u201816. Those two buildings are also contributing to it. Vincent Chao : Alright. Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick of Capital One. Go ahead. Your line is open. Tom Lesnick : Hey, guys. I will be brief, because obviously the call is going on quite a long time, but I am sorry if I missed it earlier, I was cut off we had a fire alarm in the building. But, Ray, this might really be for you. Obviously, you guys have decided to keep multifamily at Reston on balance sheet, but looking out towards the projects site at Gaithersburg, I guess, what drove the decision to sell to Camden and were you looking at any other potential counterparties? I know obviously equity residential just sold a lot of their stuff out in that direction to Starwood, so just wondering what the overall plan and thought process is there? Ray Ritchey : Well, Tom, on the multifamily, specifically to Reston and wherever multifamily is part of a mixed use development, we tend to hold on to those, because we want to control the environment for our office and retail tenants as well. So, in places like the Back Bay or certainly Reston Town Center and other mixed use projects look to us to continue to own those. Now, the situation in Gaithersburg with Camden is completely different. That\u2019s a greenfield suburban site. We still haven\u2019t developed anything vertically there yet. We sold an adjacent site to lifetime fitness. Just seemed sense to take our profit on the land, sell it and let Camden experience the great joy of going vertical. So, long story short, we are going to keep the stuff that\u2019s integrated into our projects and may continue to sell the stuff that\u2019s one-off and not key to our mixed use development. Tom Lesnick : I appreciate that insight. And then my last one, just quickly, wondering if you can comment at all on the objection to the TSA award and where that stands? Ray Ritchey : Well, I guess I will take that one. So, we have competed for the headquarters of TSA and it was awarded to another party. We had a sense that the GSA did not conduct the award as anticipated and we filed a protest. That\u2019s all we can say about it at this point in time. We are awaiting the final resolution and we will see what happens when the judge makes his ruling. Tom Lesnick : Alright, appreciate it. Thanks guys. Operator : At this time, I would like to turn the call back to management for any additional remarks. Owen Thomas : Well, that concludes our questions. Thank you very much for your time and attention when we look forward to seeing many of you in NAREIT in a few weeks. Thank you very much. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s Boston Properties conference call. Thank you again for attending and have a good day.",

During the question-and-answer portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, Senior Executive Vice President and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks. Owen Thomas : Thank you, Arista. Good morning, everyone. Our focus today in addition to the quarter and market conditions will be review of 2015 and our outlook for 2016. On current results, we produced another solid quarter with FFO per share a penny above consensus and a penny above our guidance after adjusting for the defeasance transaction. Based on recent leasing accomplishments, as well as a significant lease termination we just completed for $45 million, we have also increase the mid-point of our full year 2016 FFO per share guidance by $0.26. We leased 1.4 million square feet in the fourth quarter and 5.2 million square feet for all of 2015 and our portfolio occupancy is now 91.4%. Moving to the operating environment, the U.S. economy continues to grow, albeit at modest level, with full year 2016 GDP growth expected to be 2% to 2.5%. There was a modest slowdown in the fourth quarter of 2015 as GDP rose only 0.7%. The job's picture remains healthy with 292,000 jobs created in December, 2.7 million jobs created in all of 2015, 2.5% wage growth for the last year and 5% unemployment, albeit with lower workforce participation rates. Economic growth continues to be uneven, with energy-related industrial sectors in recession. Our markets that are driven by technology and life sciences are continuing to exhibit tightening leasing conditions. Office markets nationally are also firming. The data indicates that absorption was 17 million square feet for the fourth quarter and 46 million square feet for all of 2015. Vacancy ended the year at 13.8%, down 20 basis points for the fourth quarter and 50 basis points for the year. Asking rents rose 4.7%, with Boston and San Francisco experiencing the highest increases. Construction levels actually dropped in the fourth to 2% of existing stock, but are up 9% from a year ago. Financial markets have become very volatile in 2016, driven largely by concerns that weaker economic growth outside the U.S. and falling oil prices will have a negative impact on the U.S. economy. Most economic data indicates a continued slowdown in the Chinese economy. The domestic equity market in China is down over 20% year-to-date and fears of additional currency devaluation are pervasive. China has funded an estimated 600 billion of currency reserves over the last six months supporting the Renminbi to its current trading levels. Local regulators appear to be taking additional steps to stem capital flows out of China. Oil prices have also dropped nearly 50% from high as last year to approximately $33 a barrel. This has caused disruption in the industrial component of the U.S. economy and widening credit spreads for high-yield names, particularly related to the energy sector. We are also monitoring with interest investment activity from oil-based sovereign wealth funds as several Middle Eastern funds have reportedly been redeeming more liquid offshore investments in 2015. Lastly, despite the Federal Reserve raising short-term rates 25 basis points in December, the 10-year U.S. Treasury has dropped below 1.9%, given all the global economic uncertainty mentioned. What does all this mean for real estate investment activity and valuations? Our instincts are that investment activity from some oil-based sovereign wealth funds should slow, due to the decreasing inflows and capital needs at home and that flows from China will recede, due to increasing capital control. However, there continue to be numerous large-scale office deals completed in gateway markets at attractive pricing. Recent examples include AXA selling 787 Seventh Avenue to CalPERS and 1285 Sixth Avenue to RXR and Blackstone selling four assets in Westwood to Douglas Emmett as well as 500 Boylston Street and 222 Berkeley in Boston to Oxford and J.P. Morgan. All these deals were large and completed with North American led investors with cap rate in the mid-4% range or lower. Our read is capital values for high-quality assets are holding up notwithstanding in some cases fewer bidders and a somewhat of a geographic rotation of investor appetite. Further as a tailwind, long-term interest rates are low and dropping while cap rate spreads to treasuries are above long-term averages and rising. Investment yields and cash flow stability from high-quality real estate assets will continue to be an attractive investment alternative to fixed-income. Our capital strategy remains largely unchanged, in that we are investing more in new developments versus acquisitions, which will be funded partially by additional dispositions. On acquisitions, we continue to actively review new investments, but do not anticipate significant investments in stabilized building given continued robust pricing. We are however seeing a pickup in value-added and development opportunities in our core markets. Moving to dispositions, in the fourth quarter we completed the sale of Innovation Place in San Jose for $207 million, including a gain of $79 million and a land parcels sale in Maryland for $13 million. Our total dispositions for 2015 were $584 million on an our share basis, which led to a special dividend of a $1.25 per share, which brings our total special dividends paid since 2005 to over $21 per share. For 2016, we expect to continue to sell non-core assets and asset where we are able to achieve extraordinary pricing, but likely at levels below 2015. Our balance sheet is strong, we have already raised the cash to fund our significant capital needs and we see upside in many of our core assets through rollups and redevelopment. We recently sold 7 Kendall Center to MIT for $105 million, based on the pre-agreed option associated with MIT's tenancy in the building. We also placed under contract for sale our Reston Eastgate site to a corporate user, who will retain us to build a corporate facility for their use, further enhancing the Reston area. Though difficult to estimate precisely at this time, we would expect 200 million to 250 million of total asset sales in 2016. Moving to developments, our activities remain robust. In the fourth quarter, we placed in service from our development pipeline 535 Mission Street and 690 Folsom Street in San Francisco, the point in Waltham and Annapolis Junction 8 in Annapolis, Maryland. In the aggregate, these projects cost $254 million, and with the exception of Annapolis Junction, which is currently not leased we delivered 98% occupied and unleveraged cash yield of 7.8%, which is above our target. Also in the fourth quarter, we added to our active development pipeline, The Hub on Causeway at North Station, which is the podium phase of our North Station development in Boston, where we have signed anchor deals for 60% of the 200,000 square foot retail component and are negotiating 85,000 square feet of additional retail and office leases. North Station is a very significant mixed-use development being built adjacent to one of Boston's busiest transit stations and the TD Garden. This project is a 50% partnership with Delaware North and will provide us with significant long-term profit opportunities. At year-end, our development pipeline consisted of 11 projects, representing 4.6 million square feet and $2.6 billion in project cost. Our budgeted NOI yield for these projects is in excess of 7%. The commercial component of the pipeline is 58% pre-leased. We have all the cash, $1.5 billion required to complete the development of the portfolio, which should add materially to our Company's growth over the next four years. Looking ahead in 2016 on developments, we have numerous entitled projects and new starts will be highly dependent on preleasing activity. More specifically, we secured 940,000 square feet in additional entitlements from the City of Cambridge for Kendall Center and are in discussions with several tenants for preleasing a 360,000 square foot office building. For Springfield Metro Center in Northern Virginia, we are pursuing at 600,000 square foot requirement from the TSA. Again, predicated on substantial preleasing, other potential projects for this year are 20 CityPoint in Waltham, Mass, and Block 5 Office in Reston. All these projects aggregate 1.5 million square feet. Lastly, we continue to devote time and resources to refurbishing our existing high-quality asset base. At Citibank vacates 399 Park Avenue in late 2017, we will be completing upgrades to the fa\u00e7ade entrance roof, decks and outdoor spaces. A redevelopment of the office and retail space and the low-rise at 601 Lexington Avenue is also planned. We are also updating lobbies and common space at 1330 Connecticut Avenue and Metropolitan Square in Washington D.C. to accommodate existing tenant renewals and attract new tenants. In summary, we are very enthusiastic about our prospects for success and ability to create shareholder value in 2016 and beyond. We have a very clear plan to improve and lease our existing assets as well as add new buildings through development to our portfolio, all of which we expect to result in attractive FFO growth over the coming years. We have selected non-core asset for sale to ensure continued portfolio refreshment. We have significant entitled and un-entitled land holdings that we will continue to push through the design and permitting process and add selectively to our development pipeline in future years. Our balance sheet is strong with net debt to EBITDA below six times and with much of our upcoming debt maturities having now been either refinanced or hedged. This strong capital position will also allow us to pursue an act on investment opportunities that may present themselves in the coming quarters, due to increasingly turbulent financial market conditions. Now over to Doug for a further review of our market. Doug Linde : Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. It seems like every day, we seem to jump on this roller coaster of global volatility in the financial markets, but I do want to step back and just sort of take a little bit of a perspective here, so about eight months ago, when we were in the NAREIT conference, I think almost every meeting we had was dominated by questions focused on signs of weakness in the tech markets, the lack of public IPOs, questionable valuations of unicorns, whether there was a looming shadow vacancy in our biotech markets due to potential slowing from venture capital sources and then all this was sort of going to be precipitating a market corrections, I think honestly that these are the same questions that we were asked in November at NAREIT and they are the same questions that are on everyone's mind today. They continue to be top of mind, so just take their perspective as I give my comments. You are going to a recall that the we have been characterizing the bay area real estate market is really one of as I would refer to healthy, where the activity is really pretty similar to what was in 2013, which was a really good year, but clearly off the spike that we saw in 2014, and I think the pace of activity that we are getting today is pretty similar to the same activity that we have been seeing in the back of 2015 and it is pretty constant. I just sort of want to supply some facts to back that up, so in the Northern Peninsula in the Valley, in the last quarter or so, Apple has expanded by another 1 million square feet, Google has leased over 500,000 square feet and they have entered into additional building purchase agreements. Palo Alto Networks has expanded by 300,000 square feet. Facebook has taken on 200,000 square feet. As Owen said, we were the beneficiary of Broadcom's desire to expand and they purchased our 574,000 square feet at Innovation Center and have filed permits for the next phase of development, which is up to 537,000 square feet. Then, on top of all that, there have been another 12 fields in the Valley for over 1.3 million square feet with block of space over 50,000 square feet. We in January, signed 88,000 square feet of renewals and expansions in our single-storey Mountain View assets. That is R&D property over $48 triple net rents. If you go to the city, leasing activity in the city finished off 2015 clearly off of the 2014 level high, when Salesforce and Twitter and Dropbox, all combined for over 1.4 million square feet just those three tenants, but again was at the exact same level as we were in 2013. Tech demand continues to average around 50% of the volume in the city and there has been a pretty consistent volume appeals. Now recently, there has been continued attention to sublet space. Well, the Dropbox sublet, which was planned at China Basin. It was all absorbed by Stripe in lift. [ph] There are some of Twitter availability that was described in the mid-market area and it's all under lease negotiation. In fact, there is over 850,000 square feet of tech leasing that is expected to get done in the first quarter and it is almost entirely expansion led by Airbnb, which is taking an additional 150,000 square feet from the former Dolby building. The largest block of sublet space that was in our portfolio was a five-floor block in EC 3 coming back from the Morgan Lewis being emerging that occurred a few years ago we please four of those five floors. Now, there is some speculative construction in the city, 181 Fremont and 350 Bush and the exchange are all under construction and they are added about 1.4 million square feet of space and Park Tower at Transbay is supposedly going to be started with another 750,000 square feet, but again the overall vacancy rate in the City of San Francisco is under 6% and people continue to talk about the Prop M and issues there, but the point is that after the FAR deposit in October, the bank was at about 1.75 million square feet, but if the first in mission project 598 Brannan Street get approved, the bank will be empty. No additional supply availability. At Embarcadero Center, we completed another 220,000 square feet of office leasing during the quarter. Four floors totaled 162,000 square feet and new tenants moving into Embarcadero made up 145,000 square feet of that. During the third quarter, you may recall and I am going to refer to this a few times, we described our \"revenue bridge\" to get to the end of 2017, and I think one of the sell-side analysts on our last call sort of asked, well, so how much of that is in the bag? While in Embarcadero Center, the larger deals that we completed last quarter about 95,000 square feet are going to add about 2.4 million square feet to that 2017 revenue versus '15. The new floor deals that we did this quarter; 145,000 square feet are going to add 4.4 million square feet. We have another four more floors close to being completed and other 89,000 square feet, those floors are going to add 5.1 million square feet for a total of $12 million of incremental growth from Embarcadero Center The market-to-market on these transactions is between 40% and 70% on a gross basis and none of those transactions are in our same-store statistics for the quarter. In fact, there is only about 28,000 square feet of CBD deals in the San Francisco region in that store data in our supplemental. Traditional [ph] demand continues to be very strong and Embarcadero Center and across the city. As 535 Mission, we are now 99% leased, so this is the last time you are going to be hearing about that project for quite some time. We completed 51,000 square feet of leases, average gross rents of about $80 a square foot. The building should be fully contributing by the third quarter '16 cash return 7.8%, 150 basis points greater than our pro forma. I had hoped to announce that we had signed leases for an additional five floors at Salesforce Tower, 108,000 square feet bringing us to 821,000 square feet of leasing of that 1.4 million square foot building or 59%. Well, two of the leases are back for two of those floors, but the Lord, but the remainder is yet to come in and we expect to see it hopefully by this Friday, so we are going to have 180,000 square feet of leasing done. We are adding venture capital and management consulting clients as industry is being represented in the building. We still have active, single and multi-floor discussions going on with asset managers and hedge funds and more VCs, law firms, consulting firms, real estate brokerage firms and other non-tech service firms that encompass another 300,000-plus square foot of space. Activity continues to be really strong at Salesforce Tower, and most of these requirements are leased expiration-driven occupancy, tenants that are recognizing the value and excitement about the Salesforce Tower and wanting to be there. Again, in summary, activity across the California portfolio, our bay area portfolio, continues to be very strong.  Let us over to Manhattan, Midtown. Again, not much has changed on our activity and expectations for the Midtown market. Our tone has been pretty consistent for the last 24 months, somewhat subdued. When we made the strategic decision to get in front of our many pending leased expiration, due to the large block future availabilities to supply in the market, in our view to providing early relief in the form of taking back some space in small increments would be the best interest of both, us and our customers. Well, during this quarter, we completed another 11 deals, 120,000 square feet. 8 of them had starting rents above $90 a square foot and six were above $100 a square foot. Comparable to last quarter where we did 12 deal 10 deals over $90 a square foot and 7 over $100 a square foot. Now it is clear that during periods of high stocking credit market volatility, many things do in fact distract the high-end users. While some of the active tenants are probably elongating their decision-making process, they continue to look for space and sublet space in Midtown is at an eight-year low. In 2014, there were 570,000 square feet of leases done with starting rents between $90 and $99 a square foot, in 2015, there was more than 1.2 million. For deals over $100 a square foot, there was over 1 million square feet in 2015. The reason I talk about this is because the bulk of our availability and rollover in our portfolio in the next few years occurs in spaces that command rents in excess of $90 or $100 a square foot. Now, transaction size continues to be small, with the preponderance of the activity under 20,000 square feet for non-renewals, which is the reason we have again strategically decided to cut up the remaining floors that we have at 250 West 55th Street and we have leases out for all of our remaining pre-built suites and we have signed half lower [ph] deals on the two of the three available floors that we have. We have signed leases now for 242,000 square feet with incremental gross revenues of $18 million that will be contributing in 2017, another component of our bridge. We signed a termination agreement last night with a tenant of these 85,000 square feet in a combination of one high-rise floor, the second floor and a portion of the ground-level space at 250 West 55th Street. While working with the tenant on the transaction that would allow them to minimize their future obligations while recognizing both, the cost and the time associated with finding replacement tenants. The party's agreed to a one-time payment at a transfer of the responsibility of re-tenanting the building to Boston Properties. That space was never built out and we never provided TIs. Switching over to 399, as Owen said, we have unveiled our plans for the upgrade, including the addition of outdoor terraces and are \"Oasis in the Sky\" as we position the building to reel at 640,000 square feet of 2017 expirations. Those are late 17 expirations. We are in lease negotiations now on 200,000 square feet of that space and we completed our first four-floor deal in the mid-rise, where we are pricing the space with starting rents around $115 a square foot. There are a number of medium-sized financial institutions with 2018 and 2019 expirations that really value the more affordable low-rise large block space we have those 100,000 square foot floors and 65,000 square foot floors, but with connectivity to our slightly more expensive space in the mid-rise. Going down to Washington D.C. Two-thirds of our activity this quarter in the Washington area was in Northern Virginia, where we completed 128,000 square feet of leases with GSA renewal at VA 95 project and also some GSA contract dependent expansion at our Kingstowne project. Then we also did 10 small transactions in Reston Town Center. In January, we completed a 60,000 square-foot renewal at the Town Center, with starting rent of over $54 a square foot. Again, if you compare that to the total, where rents are an average $33 to $35 a square foot, the premium from Reston continues to show. Reston is 97% leased. Our Signature residential project is under construction and we are in lease negotiations for 80% of the 25,000 square feet of retail that is associated with our project and if our leasing team follows the typical pattern, given the lack of blocks of space and the continued demand in Reston, we should have a lead tenant for the 275,000 square-foot Signature office development sometime in 2016. In the CBD of D.C., we completed our second office lease of 601 Mass Ave and we have pretty good activity on the remaining 47,000 square feet. Our largest availability is going to be at Metropolitan Square, where we have 120,000 square foot tenant expiring at the end of the first quarter. We are in active discussions on more than 110,000 square feet of that upcoming availability. Our view is that the overall market conditions in D.C. really have not changed much. On the margin, there is probably a little bit more GSA-related leasing that is anticipated for 2016, but it is probably going to have some economic limits that will push it a little bit further out of the CBD [ph]. The district continues to be very competitive. The majority of our Boston activity during the quarter was in suburban walk in suburban Waltham, Lexington. The Waltham Metro West market, a \"suburban market\", continues to get stronger, driven by organic expansion. This quarter, we did 16 leases in our suburban portfolio for 413,000 square feet and we have another 200,000 hundred active negotiation. Rents have increased 25% over last 18 months. Delivery of the Waltham developments is on target, August for 10 CityPoint, October for 1265 Main, both projects come into service 100% leased. In January, the City of Boston learned that General Electric had chosen to move its corporate headquarters to the City. It is expected to bring about 800 jobs, but that is really not what the issue is. What it really speaks to, to the overall economic ecosystem of the area. This region continues to be a magnet for both, the life science industry, established technology companies as well as startup tech and maker organizations. This has led to continual improvement in business growth in the greater Boston area. The East Cambridge office and lab market is probably the largest beneficiary of growth and that has the best economics of any market that we are in. With 6.5 million square feet of office space and just under 8 million square feet of lab space, direct vacancies under 4%. Office rents continue to achieve new peaks with the most recent transactions being completed on office space at over $55 triple net with annual increases. Tenant improvement allowances have been reduced and are now below 60 bucks a square foot. As Owen mentioned, we finished out the year with an up-zoning of our Kendall Square development that is going to allow for the eventual development of 540,000 square feet of commercial office and 400,000 square feet of residential, including 80,000 of for sale. We are having substantive conversations right now with a number of existing tenants that are searching for growth and looking for that office space. The other news for our Cambridge portfolio is the recent decision of Microsoft to relocate a group - at 255 Main Street to the suburbs over the next 24 months. This is likely going to mean that we will have an opportunity to lease 125,000 square feet of space that was not going to be expiring April 2021. With the multisite RFP expected to be issued in may and the zoning application still in process we would expect more Cambridge tenants with near-term space needs to be likely exploring suburban Waltham and Lexington in the Boston CBD, because there is simply no place to go in the city of Cambridge right now. The Boston CBD continues to be a good market as supply has been absorbed over the last few years, so there is some speculative development in the Seaport of those modest size building. Again, GE has not landed on where its new home is going to be and it could take existing inventory or go to a new develop. At 120 St. James, where we have 170,000 square feet of availability, there are now a number of tenants reviewing their options of the building and they range from 32,000 square feet, a single floor up to the entire 170,000 the block. At 200 Clarendon, we are in lease negotiations with tenants that were still - another floor in high-rise and leave us with 90,000 square feet on floors 45, 46 and 47. High end demand in Boston has typically been for users under 30,000 square feet and we expect to lease space in smaller increments. We have completed our multi-tenant transaction in 100 Federal Street, where Putnam has signed lease for 250,000 square feet. Wellington has executed a long-term renewal and relocation on 156,000 square feet it is currently using and BMA has been able to realize some space and rent savings by reducing its footprint by 137,000 square. All of the available space at 100 Federal Street has now been spoken for. Again, as you think about our bridge, the 2017, these transactions at 100 Federal Street contribute approximately $6 million of incremental revenue. Last fall, we outlined $80 million of incremental revenue from our existing portfolio that we hope to have in place by the end of '17. Given all the transactions I described, we now have commitments for approximately 36 million of that $80 million. With that, I will turn the call over to Mike. Mike LaBelle : Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning. I am going to start out with a few comments on what we are seeing in the debt markets. As you know, we defeased our $640 million mortgage loan on 200 Clarendon Street in December. That resulted in $0.13 per share charge for our fourth quarter earnings. To replenish our cash, we closed on $1 billion 10-year bond deal at an all-in yield of 3.77%. The excess funds will be used to repay our $211 million mortgage on Fountain Square. That is open for prepayment at par in April as well as fund our future development costs. We have reduced the cash interest rate by 200 basis points with this bond deal versus the expiring loans and the annual cash interest savings will be $11.5 million even though we borrowed an additional $150 million of proceeds. On a GAAP basis, the interest rate reduction is 75 basis points as both of the refinanced loans were above market at acquisitions, so they have a non-cash fair value interest component that is amortized into and reduces GAAP interest expense. Clearly the market volatility that Owen described is having an impact on the credit markets. It is driving credit spreads wider, particularly as you move out the risk spectrum. The bond market continues to operate efficiently though and high-quality issuers like ourselves have access, albeit at spread that are 20 basis points to 30 basis point wider than the 155 basis point spread that we issued in early January. Though there are frequently days, when the global volatility does [ph] necessity patients. With the rallying the 10-year to below 2%, all-in borrowing costs really have not moved much for us. The mortgage markets have been a little more fickle with CMBS spreads widening more significantly, especially in the conduit world and for single asset deals that are in secondary markets are not fully stabilized. For high quality stabilized properties and strong locations, the markets remain active with both, life companies and CMBS issuers actively putting out mortgage money with 50% to 60% leverage loans pricing in a 4% area for 10 years. The banks are also increasingly active in financing five to seven-year term loan on a floating rate basis at competitive spreads. Although we see some volatility, good quality assets like ours continue to be able to secure attractively priced long-term financing. With the most active buyers for our asset class, looking to employ lower leverage, the financing markets remain favorable. I also want to note that over the past three years, our asset sales strategy and the delivery of development properties at superior yields has translated into a reduction in our leverage position. As our new delivery stabilize, we expect these ratios will continue to improve and create additional investment capacity on our balance sheet. I just wanted quickly touch on our earnings for the quarter. We reported funds from operation of a $1.28 per share after adjusting for the defeasance charge. We came in a penny ahead of the mid-point of our guidance range, which was related to better performance in the portfolio. Operating expenses came in better than budgeted while our revenues were pretty tightly aligned with our expectations. For 2016, we are increasing our NOI projections from our in-service portfolio. As Doug detailed, we continue to see good leasing activity, particularly in San Francisco and in Boston. In Boston, we closed the Putnam lease, and although will not impact earnings until 2017, the transaction included a relocation in long-term extension with Wellington, with future rent bumps that will be straight line in the 2016. We are also seeing increased activity in our vacancy, both in the high-rise space at 200 Clarendon Street and at the Prudential Tower, where we could see additional income commence later this year. At Embarcadero Center in San Francisco, we continue to be successful, in completing a number of lease renewals with significant rental rate increases and have activity on our availability. As these renewals are signed, our GAAP income reflects the straight line impact of the rental rate increases though the cash impact will not occur until the future renewal date which in most cases later in 2016 or 2017. As Doug mentioned, we terminated an 85,000 square-foot lease at 250 West 55th Street and received a significant termination payment $45 million. Also at 601 Lexington Avenue, we are finalizing a termination with a tenant in the high-rise, which will enable Citibank to relocate out of the low-rise office building, so it can be vacated for repositioning. Overall, we expect our 2016 termination income to be approximately $47.5 million dollars higher than our guidance last quarter. These lease terminations will result in lower future rental income until such time as we find replacement tenants. The lost income is projected to be approximately $11 million in 2016. Given his lumpy nature, our practice is to exclude termination income from our same property NOI guidance, but it does have an impact. The leasing success that we are executing exceeded our expectations and would have improved our GAAP same-store NOI growth projection by about 50 basis points. However, the lost rental income related to our decision to enter into lease terminations has more than offset this growth. The net impact on our same-store property NOI projection is a decrease of approximately 25 basis points from our guidance last quarter. The income from terminations also impacts our cash same property NOI though we still project growth of 1% to 3% over 2015. As a reminder, our same property growth is weighed down by rollover at 767 Fifth Avenue and 601 Lexington Avenue. Both of these are consolidated joint venture properties. The growth in our share the same property NOI is approximately 100 basis points higher for both, GAAP and cash. We project our non-cash straight line rental income to be $35 million to $50 million in 2016, which is higher than our projection last quarter. The completion of our bond deal takes care of a $1 billion of our near-term debt maturities. We now have $2.9 billion of consolidated debt expiring over the next two years of which $2.3 billion represents our share. These loans carry a cash interest rate of 5.9% and a GAAP interest rate of 4.4%. We have hedged the 10-year swap rate on $1 billion of the expected refinancing. The only material financing activity in our 2016 projections is the refinancing of our $350 million mortgage loan on Embarcadero Center 4, in the fourth quarter. This loan has a cash interest rate of 6.1% and a GAAP interest rate of 7%, so our interest expense run rate should be lower at the end of the year. Overall, we project our 2016 full-year interest expense to be $400 million to $450 million, which is net of capitalized interest of $40 million to $50 million. The impact of these changes results in our increasing our guidance range for 2016 funds from operation to $5.78 to $5.93 per share. This is an increase of $0.26 per share at the mid-point, which consists of $0.21 per share from the net impact of tenant terminations and $0.05 per share from better projected performance in our same property portfolio. That completes our formal remarks. Operator, if you could turn the call over to questions that would be great. Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Jamie Feldman from Bank of America. Jamie Feldman : Thank you. Good morning. Doug thanks for the color on where you stand getting to the $80 million of same-store NOI recovery. Can you just talk about the largest chunks left to go and your thoughts on timing of those leases? Doug Linde : This is called, no good deeds goes unpunished, right? Jamie Feldman : Exactly. Doug Linde : I think that there are the three largest components that are likely to be talked about over the next few quarters are at the 200 Clarendon Street, and 120 St. James, which is the building in Boston. The additional lease up at the Prudential Center, which is about 90,000 square feet of space and the changes that we are going to be going through at 757 General Motor's building, which are both the retail space at the base and the two floors that we are getting back in July. That is where the bulk of that is coming from. I think the prognosis is positive and we are working forward on transactions and all stuff, but I mean, it maybe a quarter or maybe three quarters before we announce those transactions are completed. Jamie Feldman : Okay. Thank you. You commented on some of the higher end tenants, particularly in New York City, maybe taking longer to make decisions given stock market volatility. Can you just provide more color on exactly what you are seeing and whether things are getting delayed? Doug Linde : As I said, I think, the overall tenure of the market, and I am going to let John Powers comment, is that things have just taken a little bit longer, but the activity remains the same. As an example, when I look at our portfolio of tenants looking at the space where the General Motor's building on the 34th and 35th floors, we got three or four tenants that are actively interested in pieces of those floors. I think that there are days when they are as more focused on looking at their screens than they are looking at office space, so I think it is just elongates decision-making process. John, you want to make any additional comment? John Powers : I guess, what I would add is that we finished last year with a very good leasing year, very good leasing velocity year I am talking about Manhattan overall. It was down 6% from 2014, but then again it was 6% higher than the last five years. During the year, we had issues in August and September as Owen and Doug said and we had spread widening as Mike talked about and that never moved into the leasing market. It might have won a few deals slowing things down a little, so right now we have the same kind of activity in the financial markets and people are looking at it, but a lot of large tenants are planning for significant period of time and are not continuing with what they do. Some of the smaller tenants in the smaller deals, I think, look more closely at the screens than the large organizations do. Jamie Feldman : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citi. Emmanuel Korchman : Hey, guys. Good morning. Maybe Mike or Doug, if we think about the $80 million of NOI uplift that we all keep talking about, how much of that is going to actually impact 2017 numbers? How much of that is you are thinking about that $80 million as sort of a run rate going into 2018? Doug Linde : I wish I could give you an honest answer, because the timing is what really is going to drive that. I can tell you that, much of it will start to bleed in, in latter part of '16 and much of it will bleed in over '17, so there is no question that by the end of '17 we will have all of it in our estimation right now. I can't tell you if it is 50% in the first quarter of '17 or 80% in the first quarter of '17, a lot of it is just going to be depending upon the physical characteristic of the space and when we can start recognizing revenue. Emmanuel Korchman : But it's fair to assume that some majority portion will be a '17 impact and then there will be bleed over or and there will be bleed over that impacts '18, specifically? Doug Linde : Yes. I think, the fact is that a lot of it is going to be coming in very bulky manner in 2017, not all on January 1, 2017, but over each quarter. By the fourth quarter it will all be there, but again a significant piece of it is going to be in [ph] Emmanuel Korchman : Great. Then just thinking about San Francisco for a second, how much of the showings of the demand at Salesforce is overlapping with either current or prospective tenants at Embarcadero? Doug Linde : That was I think a question that we had last quarter as well. It is an interesting question, so existing incumbent tenants at Embarcadero Center, we have one tenant that we are talking to at Embarcadero Center that is likely to leave and move to sales force. There are some tenets are looking at both, Embarcadero Center and Salesforce that are not tenants on our portfolio right now. Emmanuel Korchman : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Vincent Chao : Good morning, everyone. I just want to go back to your comments earlier on investment markets feeling like there is going to be a little bit of a pullback from the oil-based economies in China, which makes some sense, but you also mentioned other geographies picking up. I guess, on net, do you think those are geographies will be able to offset the lost in-flows from those other two segments, and curious if that is more based on your expectations or have you started to see that unfolding in the markets already? Owen Thomas : Yes. I think that we have seen it unfolding in the markets over the last couple of quarters. I cited $3 billion-plus $4 billion-plus deals in high quality office space, high quality office deals and gateway markets that went to North American-lead investment group, so either U.S. pension funds, other U.S. investors or Canadian investors. I think that there is a bit of a geographic rotation, but thus far certainly U.S. investors, Canadian investors, we are increasingly seeing Japanese investors in the marketplace, investors from Asia, outside of China, there are other groups that are in the marketplace and so far have led to a lack of reduction in pricing at least today. Vincent Chao : Okay. Then just on the flipside of that you also mentioned seeing more opportunities in the value-add side of things and I was just curious if you could provide some more color on exactly what is driving that? Are there more projects coming to market, are the traditional buyers pulling back, a combination of those and have cap rates moved significantly in that space? Owen Thomas : On the value add, I think we have mentioned for many quarters prior to this and also in this quarter, we are focusing on new investments where we can use our real estate talent, so that I would either new development or redevelopment of existing assets. I do think right now we have a fairly robust pipeline of things that we are looking at in both of those categories and most of our core markets. These are areas where many of the sovereign wealth funds and offshore investors - you know it is not 100% the case, but they are less active and you that is helpful to us. Vincent Chao : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors. Jed Reagan : Good morning, guys. There were some concerns put out there last week that New York City job and rent growth is likely to soften this year. Then non-core assets values in the city might be re-priced lower. Are you expecting those kinds of changes yourselves and do you think this could affect some other markets in your portfolio? Owen Thomas : Jed, before I let John respond more specifically about his views, the Company's perspective has been that we have been seeing modest amount of rental rate growth over the last few years, because as we have characterized the market it is a healthy market, not an accelerating market. I think our perspective has been very constant over the last three or four of these calls about issues associated with the growth of rental rates and economics in the city largely due to the amount of supply that is in the market from either relocations to the new building, on the Far West side or Downtown and the retrenchment that occurred in 2013 and 2014, those yield actually starting to get completed. As an example time place moved who finally down World Financial Center and their building on Fifth Avenue is now vacant and available to lease and they are doing a repositioning on it. Everyone knew that the building was going to be there, but it is now in the market, so there are a number of those types of macro supply issues that we have been watching and following. Again, while we made our decisions and had tempered our views on what would be going on in Manhattan in calendar year 2016 and 2017, and John I do not know if you want to add anything to that? John Powers : Let me just add to my previous comment, I said last August and September, the financial markets had a drop off and there were concerns and we have that now. It did not move to the leasing market last time. We do not know whether move the leasing [ph] markets this time. It hasn't yet, but obviously if the financial markets continue to have problems and the economy has problems than that will affect everyone. On the New York side, we do not see any change over the last few months in the leasing. I would say the only change that is really noteworthy and Doug has mentioned the supply for a number of times is the deal with the news did not get done at two, so that is a 2.8 million square foot building that is now getting built Downtown, so on the supply side we understand that that is way out, but we do look way out - let us say over the next three or four years. Certainly that is supply side. We do not need another 2 million square foot building on Sixth Avenue to come in the market in terms of the supply, so are we just moving along in New York, no big change yet, but obviously we are concerned like everyone is with the financial markets and what is happening globally and if that is going to have a real impact on leasing market in the coming months. Jed Reagan : Okay. Thanks for those comments. Then just as far as the kind of non-core value-add type of assets, are you expecting a re-pricing downward on those types of buildings in the city or elsewhere? Owen Thomas :  I do not think we necessarily anticipate that. It certainly could happen. I do think that market is stronger for core assets and gateway city than it is as you go out the risk spectrum in real estate investment, but we are not necessarily expecting a re-pricing of those assets. Doug Linde : We are certainly not getting any re-trading on deals that we are working on in New York. Jed Reagan : Okay. Thank you. Then you mentioned the 200 million to 250 million of planned asset sales for 2016, just curious if the recent downdraft in share prices make you want to sell more aggressively than your are currently planning potentially or just how you are thinking about that? Owen Thomas : Our asset sales are driven by selling non-core assets, which we do every year. Innovation Place was probably the most recent example of that. Then from time-to-time, we have opportunistically sold assets where we achieved what we thought was extraordinary pricing. This year I mentioned an early prediction of asset sales mix in the $200 million to $250 million range. As I mention also, we have already done seven Kendall Center, which is a little over 100 million, so we are not changing our disposition plan for this year based on current market conditions. We basing it on desire to continue to sell non-core assets. Jed Reagan : Okay. Thanks for the color guys. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Alexander Goldfarb : Good morning. Just following up that, Owen, on the disposition side, last cycle you guys sold some rather large CBD office buildings and this time it sounds like that is not in the cards, so just curious is that simply because the CBD towers that that you own now have better growth profiles than the ones you sold last time or is it a fact that as submarkets have been built up, you see less opportunity to get back into the submarkets where you want to be? Owen Thomas : Alex, we have sold a lot of very significant portfolio of assets this cycle. 2014 was the largest year of assets selling at Boston Properties. Our total sales for this cycle, I think, are in excess of $3 billion. Remember, the joint venture we did with the Norges on four assets over two years, another significant asset that we sold, also, the large reason why we have made the very significant special dividends that I described and also the reason that our current gearing is below 6, so we feel like we have done very significant selling this cycle. Alexander Goldfarb : I guess, Owen, from the perspective that last time you sold outright stakes. This time it has been a bit more on the JV, so I did not know if that had an impact in sort of how you see the reinvestment opportunity. That is where the question was going. Owen Thomas : No. I think that we did sell 100% of several assets in the portfolio. I agree they were not as large as the joint venture transaction that we did. I think the JVs were a function of the fact that the marketplace was very aggressive for the joint venture structure, which was attractive to us. Second, the assets that we have in joint venture, we do believe in and we, in many cases, are improving and growing the cash flows, so the combination of both. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. Then on California, Doug, I appreciate the comments on the tech leasing environment out there. It sounds like things are pretty good, but just from the from our standpoint, as we read news headlines - well, you spoke about Twitter, but Yahoo having issues or various tech tenants having issues. On the demand side, on the user side, is it basically as though the market, this is just normal tech volatility and this is always part of the cycle or what would be the red flags that would indicate that some of these tech issues headlines are more so than just normal, expected volatility in business models? Doug Linde : You are asking, what is the canary in the coal mine, right? I think that that it is a really difficult question to answer with a specific fact that we will look and say okay now the market is going to go turn. I think that in the last four or five years, the City of San Francisco has reshaped itself so dramatically in terms of the tenant demand that the diversity of companies and the strength of those companies is so different that I think that it will be much more difficult to sort of look at look at any one particular industry or any one particular company and say okay things have really changed. I mean clearly a overall GDP reduction and a series of layoffs from major technology companies would be the thing that I think would make it a clear-cut type of a demarcation, but again we just do not see that. I mean, we see these large tech companies that have got pretty strong balance sheet and pretty global reaches now being able to weather the storm in a pretty significant manner and with business strategies that have a very long-term focus associated with them, so there is no question that there are going to be failures in certain tech industries. All of the mobile payment companies are not going to survive. I mean, you know they are in all likelihood a couple of unicorns that are not going to make it just from a valuation and from a capital perspective, but we have spent a tremendous amount of time looking at the demand from the sort of startup community versus the \"traditional\" now and more fundamentally sound technology companies. On a relative basis, the City of San Francisco was in a really good place. Bob, I do not know if you have any other comment you want to make. Bob Pester : No. I think you covered it. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. Thank you, Doug. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS. Ross Nussbaum : Hey, guys. Good morning. Can you touch on each of your four major markets. Do you think market rents actually go up this year and can vacancies sort of hold where they are or do you see any risk of market rents flattening, going down, vacancy going up, maybe put some context around that. It sounds like you are pretty bullish around your opening comments, but I was just curious how that translates into what you really see at the market rent vacancy level? Owen Thomas : Yes. I guess, so I would characterize the way we feel that we are cautiously optimistic that rents will marginally improve across our markets. Meaning that in markets like San Francisco, we believe, we will continue to see modest increases in rents. I do not think we are going to see spikes in the suburban Boston in the CBD of Boston we are going to see good growth in rents, not spikes. In Midtown, Manhattan we think we are going to see pretty flat marginal growth in rents a 2%, depending upon the quality of the space and the location of the space. In a market like Reston, I think, we can push rents 2% or 3%, maybe up to 5%, depending upon the space in the city of Washington D.C. It is going to be a pretty flat year. We think it is a good market not a spiking market. Ross Nussbaum : Okay. Helpful. Then specifically, if I look at 250 West 55th, and I look at the lease termination, can you help us understand, if there was almost 20 years left on the lease, why did not you say to the tenant, I think we all know who it is, but why did not you say to the tenant, look, you signed a contract, pay us the rent and go sublease it. Why was not that an option? Owen Thomas : I think, I am going to give you the glimpse of quick and dirty [ph] answer and John can choose to add some color if he would like. I think that is the approach that we took and I think we got to a point where we felt that the economics of the payments that the tenant was making us more than justified the risk that we would be taking, we letting the space at a valuation that would provide us with a significant enhancement on a total NPV basis. Ross Nussbaum : Our math is, you got about five years give or take worth of rent. Is that about sort of the specific lease it in the next five years - is that about right? Owen Thomas : I am not going to speak specifically to what the tenant is paying us, because I just do not think that is appropriate, but the way we looked at it, it was - we had not yet given the tenant any money to build out their space, so that is sort of helps money and we believe that we will be able to reel at the space in short order at market transactions and that we will come out significantly ahead versus what the payment that the tenant made us. Ross Nussbaum : I appreciate it. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. I guess, a couple of quick questions. Doug, I guess on the 250, I just want to kind of circle back. Before this termination, the building was kind of what percent leased are committed and just what kind of discussions maybe have you had behind the scenes with existing tenants about possible expansion needs in the building? Doug Linde : I think prior to this we were 92% leased and we have leases outstanding for another floor, so another 3% or 4%, so we are basically 94%, 95%. I would expect that the space that we are getting back, remember, I said there is some space on the ground floor that is retail. Then there is space on the second floor and then there is one high-rise tower floor that we will in all likelihood lease the high-rise tower floor to tenants outside of the buildings similar to the way we have been leasing up the 33rd, the 34th, 35th floor, so they are going to be 5,000 square feet to 12,000 square feet to maybe fourth floor and I do not believe that anybody in the building will take the second floor and the retail will come from retailers who are obviously looking to place their inflation on 8th Avenue. Steve Sakwa : Okay. Thanks. I guess, going to Salesforce Tower, I mean it sounds likes you are making a little bit of progress here, had some leasing done and it sounds like you have got other things in the pipeline. Just help us kind of map out over the next couple of quarters kind of what goals you have, kind of where you want to be maybe by the middle of the year, end of the year as you kind of turn the corner in the '17. What does sort of the leasing progression look like as we now get into the strike zone of delivery? Doug Linde : Yes. Again, just in the context, the building it is going to be available for tenants other than Salesforce in the latter half of 2017 and into early 2018. I would expect that we now have done another five floors, knock on wood, that we will get the last signature page. I mean, leases are literally out for signature in the next couple of days, so our expectation is there is another 200,000 square feet to 300,000 square feet of leasing that we hope to get done during calendar year 2016, obviously, for rent commencement in late '17 or early '18. I think that would be or that is our sort of base case goal. Bob, you can comment and you will probably tell me you are going to have the whole thing leased before the end of the year, but I would moderate that\u2026 Bob Pester : I would just to add that, just this past week we had an inquiry for 200,000 feet to 500,000 feet from a very well known tenant in the marketplace. This week we also had three senior real estate heads from Wells Fargo, Google, Intel, all come for a presentation on the building, which was better attended than we expected. I mean, clearly people are looking at this building and I remain very optimistic that we are going to lease that quickly. Steve Sakwa : Okay. I guess last question maybe for Doug Linde and/or Owen, as you just think about some of the development projects that you talked about our future developments. I realize you guys generally have a relatively high hurdle for preleasing, but just what are the discussions like on some of those. If you have to handicap, how much you think you start this year maybe without naming specific projects. What do you think that looks like? Owen Thomas : Yes. Well, Steve, as you said, we do have a high bar for new development. We have, we talked about our target yields and we also like to see significant pre-leasing. I went through some of the projects in my remarks. The most significant ones are the TSA requirement at Springfield, which I do not think we are prepared necessarily to handicapped certainly pursuing it. Ray, comment on Reston and what the prospect looks like for the Signature site that we are working in Reston right now. Bryan, I do not know if you want to spend a minute on CityPoint to talk about what prospects are for that, so Ray can I turn over to you? Ray Ritchey : Sure, Owen. Thanks. Where Reston sits today effectively 100% leased, and no due supply coming online either from us or from the competition, we feel exceedingly strong about. This may come as a shocker, but we are pushing those back. We think that the floor sizes, the building size and the internal demand we have within the market to clearly justify it, but we are in discussions with about three or four major existing tenants of ours who have expressed interest in anywhere between 80,000 square feet to 150,000 square feet. Owen Thomas : Bryan, you want to spend a minute on 20 CityPoint? Bryan Koop : Yes. The quite a story about the strength of the Boston market is the Waltham market in general. If you look at it, our competitive set is like 5% in terms of vacancy and it is probably two, three points down from the previous year, so we got a good supply side look at the marketplace. On the demand side, Doug mentioned it earlier, we have got good life science activity many companies looking from migration out of Cambridge into this immediate suburb. Then also in the [ph] cyber or cloud tech segment of the marketplace, good growth and Doug mentioned the strength of the larger companies and the concern about it what we are seeing again it is in a quiet way these mid-size companies 50,000 feet growing to 70,000 square feet to 100,000 square feet with strong financial statements and strong product, so we are really encouraged about what has taken place. Last note on is just that there is a strong appeal for product that has the amenities that have been lacking in the marketplace those being the restaurants and that is what has been so attractive to clients about CityPoint. Steve Sakwa : Then, Bryan, lastly the last one which you had mentioned is the Kendall Center, the new office project the Kendall Center? Bryan Koop : Yes. A lot of ways, it is quite new to market, because we just got the approvals on it, so it is very recent in terms of its news and the opportunity. Again, just to reiterate, you and Doug had mentioned the strength and the number of people who we are talking to is significant in this market - Kendall remains very\u2026 Doug Linde : Steve, to summarize, so the projects I think if you keep an eye on our Kendall Centers, Springfield Metro, 20 CityPoint and the Signature site - we are all working hard on getting pre-leasing, so we start this projects. Steve Sakwa : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brad Burke from Goldman Sachs. Brad Burke : Hi. Good morning, guys. Just a follow-up to the last question, taking everything that you just said in summarizing it, should we think about the negative macro headlines that we are seeing over the past few months have having had any impact on how you are thinking about the pace, the magnitude of total new development starts over the course of 2016? Owen Thomas : I think, we are generally conservative in our approach to new development. We talked about our yield targets being 7%-plus for office. We have a pre-letting requirement, which we also think helps mitigate risk in development. I would also point out that our development pipeline is not static. We just announced the delivery of several projects of our pipeline. That is going to continue. Even if we add a few projects this year, it is likely our development pipeline may actually go down during the year. Yes. We are paying attention. The macro headlines do matter, but at the same time if we have a project that we think pencils too an attractive yield to shareholder and we have risk mitigation through pre-leasing we are going to launch it. Brad Burke : Okay. Then, just an update on how you are thinking about the appropriate amount of liquidity and appropriate amount of leverage in the current environment and whether that has shifted it all over the past few months. Owen Thomas : Brad, I think that we have acted to bolster our liquidity additionally with the bond deal we just did. We have looked at our future debt maturities and we did that the defeasance, so we are kind of taking some of those maturities off the table now. We have got all the capital raised to fund out our development pipeline, so we have a very, very liquid balance sheet and are in strong position. From a leverage perspective, on net debt to EBITDA basis, we are somewhere in the high 5s, so that is down pretty significantly over the last four, five years. We expect to continue as I mentioned in my comments, as our development pipeline will be coming online and we have already raised the money to do that and those developments we are expected to generate strong yields, so I think that our capacity to do additional thing is just going to grow, so we think we are a very, very well-positioned from both, the liquidity perspective and leverage perspective right now. Brad Burke : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Blaine Heck : Thanks. Back on the topic of 250 West 55th, I think some of the space on the second floor is pretty unique, so how are you guys thinking about releasing that? Will it need to go a specific type of users, what do you think you will have demand that will be pretty broad based? Owen Thomas : \u2026you want to take that? Doug Linde : Sure. It is very unique space. It is almost the side core at that lower second level with the four floor plate being close to 50,000 feet and the ceiling heights make it and large windows make it very unique space. We have the flexibility to use the second floor in creative ways. We could clearly use it for access into the lobby and use it for office space, but we could also access it from 8th Avenue from some of the retail space and use it for different type of use, studios or other, so we will be look at all of that. Blaine Heck : Okay. That is helpful. Doug Linde : The Tower floor is we get a lot of velocity up there and we already have that offer on one floor. Blaine Heck : Okay. Great. Then in the past you have talked about some good prospects for a permanent solution on the old FAO space. Is there any update on that? Owen Thomas : Yes. I will give you the macro view. The macro view is, we are in conversations with a number of tenants and we are optimistic that our perceived view of the value and the critical nature of that space for someone's brand will melt together and we are optimistic we are going to have a deal done sometime in 2016 for someone to use this space in 2017. Blaine Heck : Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of John Guinee with Stifel. John Guinee : Great. Thank you. Few questions here, first, Ray Ritchey\u2026 Ray Ritchey : Hi, John. John Guinee : \u2026general dynamics of Washington Business Journal article a couple of weeks ago, moving into - you are doing a build-to-suit for them on Sunset Hills Road. I think, it is in Reston, there was also an article that Northrop Grumman is spending $300 million to buy versus lease space in the Baltimore, Washington area. Do you have any sense as with defense contractors out there, whether there is a tendency to lease versus own and control their own space? Then you have got to do this without talking your book. What do you think are the better submarkets in D.C. as the defense contractors, cyber security-driven get back into the market and lease space? Ray Ritchey : That is right. That is a long question. I will give my best to be as brief as possible. First of all, I cannot comment on the specifics of the tenant coming or the purchaser coming to Reston. There is a little bit movement towards owning this space. As you know the accounting change taking place in '18, will have an impact on many corporations or how they book their occupancy cost, but I still think that the defense contractor want to have given the uncertainty of long-term government contracts, they still want to stay relatively short in the lease terms, so they are not held out either long-term lease obligations or the lack of liquidity by owning real estate, so I think the - isolated is an example, John, but I do not see a general trend. Relative to the market for cyber command, obviously, we are optimistic that the Fort Meade will continue to pump out both, contracts and then resulting jobs to those corridor, still is very strong with the presence of major Intel activities out there overall in CIA, so we like our positions in both of those markets. I will say that there Rosslyn-Ballston corridor is relatively soft and I think that is more about the fact that now Tysons with the silver line has opened up another market that those defense contractors go to with better access and lower occupancy cost, so that still face the challenges, but we were put our money in the Dallas corridor and the Fort Meade market. John Guinee : Okay. Great. Then, Doug, this is a question on lease economics and value creation versus just simply no value creation and being on a hamster wheel. What we have seen happen in over the last four or five years has been an interesting situation, where you have seen rental rates go up, but you have also seen CapEx and re-leasing costs remain high, essentially financing corporate America. Clearly, if you get a mark-to-market of zero cash, 5 GAAP, and $50 in TI, that being the math there is value destruction. What you need in terms of rollups in order to justify the CapEx you are putting into these buildings to say to your shareholders, we have got value creation here? Doug Linde : Well, you are just making one sort of subtle argument that there is no real value to the cash flow from a building one the lease has been signed that is different than the amortization of the transaction costs into that building and I guess I would argue that, in many cases the expectation associated with what these buildings will do in the future is an important component to how they are being valued, so while on a short-term basis it may be true that in a particular building where a lease is rolling at a \"flat mark-to-market\" and you are putting transaction cost in on a net effective basis it is obviously slightly dilutive. If there is a perception, and in many of these markets there is a perception, which is based upon reality that rental rates will grow over time. There is significant value that is likely embedded in that cash flow from that particular lease on a forward basis, so that is how you have to think about it. Now, there are in fact cases where we do not have a view that there is going to be rental rate growth of any significant. As Owen suggested that those are buildings where we are sort of saying, you know, leasing these things up and selling these buildings might be the best course of valor here, so we have done a number of those sort of modest prunings over the years, where in fact we have agreed with you that there really is not a lot of value to be attributed to doing additionally leasing of these assets. John Guinee : Okay. Wonderful. Then, Mike LaBelle, I realize taxable income does not line up with EPS exactly, but your dividend run rate is about $0.65 a share or $2.60 a year. In 2014, your earnings per share was $3.72, and when you take your $2.60 standard dividend and your $1.25 special it came out to $3.85, which is pretty close to your earnings per share for '14. The 2015 earnings per share guidance is about $2.75 at the mid-point. What that tell us about - I am sorry misspoke, I meant 2015 and now 2016. Your 2016 earnings per share guidance is about $2.75 at the mid-point. What does that tell us about future dividend policies? Mike LaBelle : That is a good question. I think that as our development comes online. If we slowdown our assets sale as Owen had mentioned that is going to grow our taxable income. As our taxable income grows we will want to keep up with our traditional dividend policy of dividend out 100% of our taxable income so you would expect that our dividends would grow. Whether that occurs in 2016 or not, I cannot tell you right now. What I can say is that at this point, we have not made any change to our dividend policy for this year. Obviously, in prior years, we have sold the tremendous amount of assets and we have delivered I think it is $8 a share and special dividend in last few years, so we have lost income from those assets that we have sold. We replaced it with development and we have elected to keep our dividend in our regular dividend line, because we have been able to base upon our taxable income, but we have got a sizable development pipeline that is going to be adding to our income in the next few years, so depending on what happen on assets sales, I would expect our taxable income is going to go up. John Guinee : Great. Thank you very much. Owen Thomas : Okay. Operator : Your next question is from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Market. John Kim : Thank you. I was wondering if you could share any surprises or other takeaways from your bond offering last month, perhaps if there was a widening disparity of investor appetite between A-minus and lower credits or any investor concerns on the office fundamentals. Owen Thomas : Look, I think that our bond offering went very well. I would say it was better than we expected given the volatility that we were seeing in the market. We wanted to try to do something either in December or January, so we have been looking at the market for a while and it has been pretty volatile throughout and the demand for our deal was over four times what we expected to raise, so we were able to tighten during the process and get to a level that we thought was a really a good level and there has been other companies that are highly rated companies, including a company yesterday not in the REIT space that has been very, very successful. I think as you go down the risk spectrum into lower investment grade and non-investment grade, the widening and credit spreads in the last 30 day has been more significant than the 20 basis points to 30 basis point that I mentioned for companies like ourselves. Doug Linde : I just want to comment. Mike has done a terrific job managing down our balance sheet and putting us in what I consider to be an enviable position relevant to both, our liquidity and our assets to capital and has done a really good job of working with the bond investors to educate them on the principal foundations of how our business runs, so we know we did our deal and I think we have traded 5 basis points to 7 basis points wide in a period where the market is traded 30 basis points wide. I think the reason that we were successful as we were is because the company is in a really good stead with the bondholders and I think it is very satisfying and it give us a lot of comfort that going forward into 2016 and 2017, as Mike spoke earlier, we do have additional maturities that we are going to be in a pretty good place to access either the unsecured or the secured markets at whatever the market pricing is but at the tightest levels possible. John Kim : Due to fixed-income investors have a similar amount of concerns on the tech slowdown and New York fundamentals or are they less concerned about the future? Doug Linde : I think they think about it in a significant way, but ultimately then they look at both, the covenant structure of our rebounds and they look at the overall leverage ratio of our company and how we performed over the past decade as being an unsecure issuer and they get very comfortable with the way we have managed our book of business. John Kim : Okay. Then Doug, on your answer to Ross's question earlier on market rental growth, can you clarify if that was for asking rents or effective rents that you are seeing? Doug Linde : I am talking about grows base rent. John Kim : So with vacancy tightening in the some markets, do you see TIs decreasing? Doug Linde : I think the TIs have come down in some places and I think the TIs have basically stabilized in other, so as an example. I still think in San Francisco, if you doing a 10-year or a 15 years lease with a tenant that is going to be rebuilding space there are likely looking for a $70-plus a square foot. By the way, the $70 a square foot is probably getting 60% of the way to what their cost are and it might have been getting them five years ago, because this was a part of construction as well as changes to the energy cost and other cost that are acquiring them - that they would not have had to do, which is just simply increase the overall cost of occupancy. I think from the tenants' perspective interestingly they actually see a diminution and the transaction costs in many of these deals we are sort of looking it as a flat. John Kim : Got it. Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Rich Anderson from Mizuho Securities. Rich Anderson : Yes. I will just ask one question, try to keep it short. Doug, you mentioned early expiry early on and the comments about taking back incremental small increments of space in New York and trying to get in front of some of the supply pressures. Do you have a visibility into that pipeline? In other words, what amount of the space in New York do you think tenants have signaled interest to either shrink or exit their space at some point in the future? Doug Linde : I am going to let John answer that question. Interestingly, I think, we have had a presentation that we have done for a number of groups that where we have gone out and shown people what is ultimately anticipated coming onto the market over the next few years. I think all of that is sort of built into it. John why do not you sort of describe the results? John Powers : Well, right now I can say we do not have any discussion with any of our tenants about shrinking. That has probably synced as I can put it, we have done over the last couple of years, as you know a number of law firm deals. Some of those law firms have taken the same amount of space, because they are growing, but they are more efficient in the space that they have and other of those law firms have dropped significantly. Sometimes by 15% or 20%, but right now we do not see any tenants that are in the portfolio that we are talking to or for that matter tenants that are looking at that from outside that are shrinking. Rich Anderson : What is the motivation to be taking this proactive step? John Powers : Well, different tenants have different motivations. We are talking to someone at 399 for a very large block of space that is in three or four locations and they want to consolidate. That is an important motivation. We are talking to some tenants in the building that have bought other companies that want to expand and want to consolidate everyone into 399. It is always a specific business issue for the tenants that you are dealing what are the prospects that you are dealing with. Doug Linde : Rich, let me just speak a little bit more clear. Our decision to redo Weil Gotshal, Kirkland & Ellis, Reed Smith, and lock [ph] was a decision where we said okay there are a number of new buildings that are being built across the city and there are a number of buildings that are going to be vacated across the city when the tenants that are in them are moving to buildings that are currently vacant and our tenants are a likely candidate for all of those future availabilities as we think we have the ability to help them get into more efficient space, take some space back in calendar year 2015 or 2016 or 2017, in a very modest way that can be both, accretive to them in terms of being able to reduce their footprint prior their expiration in 2019 or 2020 and give us an opportunity to lease space at rents that are better than what those current tenants are paying. It was the recognition that they were a number of competitive availabilities that our tenants were going to be looking at over the next few years and taking advantage of our attributes in terms of timing and ability to do things with them earlier that led us to go in those direction and that space is available today, so we feel really good about all those decisions. Rich Anderson : Okay. Good enough. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Tom Catherwood from Cowen & Company. Tom Catherwood : Yes. Good morning. A quick question on D.C. Obviously the 9% leasing spreads this quarter were the highest since 2011, but Doug, building off your comments, saying you expect rents to be flattish in 2016. Do you think the driver of those kind of moderating to no growth rents, is more slower demand, or is it an impact of kind of increased supply in the market? Doug Linde : Ray, do you want to take that? Ray Ritchey : Yes. Let me take a shot. One of the things we look at is, not only the new construction that is new development taking place, but we are seeing in D.C. a repositioning of older assets, moving them from C-minus to A-minus and that level of supply is probably at an all-time high. That is why we are so aggressive - talking to our tenants. We just renewed Steptoe was 17 expiration, we are talking to Akin with the 2020 expiration, we are trying to get our larger existing - locked up, because they are targets of those new buildings coming online. Unlike the other three markets that we are in, D.C. is very much a lease expiration-driven market. We do not have Salesforce coming and take 70,000 square feet as Bob enjoys in San Francisco, so our strategy is to get out with our existing tenants, lock them up and then aggressively go after other people's tenants to backfill our new development. To summarize, it is much more about the increasing supply, moderating any future growth in demand. Tom Catherwood : Got it. I appreciate that. Then one quick up in Cambridge, obviously, the up-zoning of Kendall Square is a big deal. Do you have an estimate of the per square foot value of that additional FAR that you guys received? Doug Linde : I would not want to halfheartedly give you an answer. I will just say as follows, that we have the ability in some places to build structure on top of parking areas and in other times there may be a requirement to remove a particular existing assets and add density to it, so the mathematics associated with what the value is are really difficult to sort of described with a number. I will tell you that we believe that we will be able to achieve rents in excess of that mid-to-high 60s on a triple-net basis in current market conditions and over time we think those rents are going to go up, because there is such a lack of supply in that area, so we believe we will be able to profitably figure out how to use that density. Tom Catherwood : Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Craig Mailman from KeyBanc. Craig Mailman : Hey, guys. I will try to keep it quick. On the Salesforce, net-net, the 300,000 square feet you guys are working on with 2017 expirations, do you think that that would indicate an expansion space versus what those guys have in place or a contraction? Doug Linde : I think in most cases these are financial services companies that are looking for a modest amount of incremental expansion as they move forward. There are none of them are looking to reduce their... Craig Mailman : Okay. Then the 200 to 500 that you guys are just got the inquiry on, is that someone that is new to the market in expansion space or more of a forward expiration that they are looking to consolidate into your building with? Doug Linde : It is an existing tenant in the marketplace that continues to expand. Craig Mailman : Okay. Then just last one. Owen, you touched on earlier that you guys are looking at more value-add and development opportunities just more on the development side. Kind of how far out are you guys looking in terms of opportunities for this cycle or next cycle, which markets, perhaps outside the Volpe site would you guys be interested in adding additional sites for? Owen Thomas : Yes. It is opportunity-driven. We are actively looking at new investment opportunities in all of our market. We have on balance sheet today actually a very significant pipeline of both entitled and un-entitled land that we are going to continue to push through the entitlement and permitting process. New projects at this stage it depends. I mean, they could be for a future cycle. I suppose if for prospect exist for the cycle, probably less likely. Craig Mailman : All right, great. Thanks, guys. Owen Thomas : I just want to add a couple of things just to that last question. We have interestingly a shadow, shadow pipeline that we have talked about before. As an example, in Reston, Virginia when light rail comes, we are going to get an up-zoning in density and Peter; you can describe what how much of that we are going to be getting there on land that we own in our existing footprint. In Boston, we are in the midst of beginning our Back Bay Train Station, up-zoning entitlements for up to 1.75 million square feet of space, so there are projects like that that are more long range. They are not 2017 starts. They are probably 2018 or 2019 or 2020 starts that are physically in the Company's - on balance sheet right now and we just need to protect them. Then we have buildings like Fourth and Harrison, where again we are in the permitting process for up to 900,000 square feet and likely it will probably be a little bit less than that, but when Central SoMa eventually gets permitted and we are in a position to start a building it is another market, where we are looking for things. We have talked about Dock72, where we will hopefully be under construction in the next few weeks with the first building, where we have the potential to do another million square feet. Again, there is a really good embedded inventory of places in the Company that we can add inventory over time. I think that completes all the questions. Hopefully, we have been able to demonstrate to you all the progress we have made on our plans. Thank you very much for your attention this morning. Operator : This concludes today's Boston Properties conference call. Thank you again for attending and have a great day.",

I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks. Owen Thomas : Thanks Arista, good morning, everyone. This morning I\u2019ll cover our quarterly results, the macro market conditions that we see, as well as our current capital strategy and investment activity. On current results, we produced another strong quarter with FFO per share $0.05 above consensus, primarily due to improved operating performance. We've also increased the midpoint of our full year 2016 FFO per share guidance by $0.05, released 1.5 million square feet in the first quarter above historical averages, and our portfolio occupancy is now 91%, down 40 basis points from year end due primarily to the Genentech vacancy of 186,000 square feet at 601 Gateway in South San Francisco. We had solid rent rollup in our leasing activity with rental rate on leases that commenced in the first quarter up to 16% on a gross basis and 26% on a net basis compared to prior lease. The leasing results in San Francisco, New York and Boston all exhibited strong growth over the quarter. Our U.S. economic growth continues to be positive, though we certainly see a hands of slowdown, fourth quarter GDP growth is now reported at 1.5%, which is down 2% from the third quarter last year, and estimates for this quarter are below 1%, however our most forecasters for this year are still predicting growth in excess of 2.5% albeit after downward revision. The job's picture remains fairly healthy with 215,000 jobs created in March and the unemployment rate are steady at 5%, labor participation statistics are unchanged. We also see office market nationally continuing to improve, net absorption was 5.9 million square feet in the first quarter, vacancy rate remained essentially unchanged at 13.9%, asking rents rose 4.7% over the last year, construction levels also rose 6% over the last year, but remain at 2% of total stock, slightly above long-term averages for the U.S. office market. We continue to see the strongest space demand in locations driven by technology, life sciences and other innovative industries, notwithstanding all the financial disruptions in the last nine months. Moving to the financial markets, they\u2019ve improved materially from their lows in mid-February. S&P 500 is up over 14%, credit spreads have narrowed, oil prices are up over 50%, near-term interest rate increases also look less likely with the U.S. Federal Reserve highlighting concerns about sluggish growth, and other central banks around the world, most recently, the European Central Bank signaling an accommodative posture, 10 year U.S. treasury is hovering around 1.9% is traded below 2% since January. Credit spreads have narrowed, though less so for riskier credit. Now moving to real estate, on private real estate \u2013 private markets real estate valuation, prices remained strong for prime assets in Gateway markets. And we\u2019ve seen plenty of evidence of this over the first quarter and seen a number of transactions in our core markets that were offered and priced in 2016, examples of this include; in Boston 101 Seaport that\u2019s a new 440,000 square foot office building located in the Seaport District, a 100% leased to PWC on a long-term basis, sold for $1,029 a square foot and a 4% initial cap rate to a German fund. In Washington DC, 733 10th Street, a fully leased 170,000 square foot office building sold for about a 4.7% initial cap rate, 1,065 square foot, I believe only the third building to trade above 1,000 per square foot in the district, the buyer was a Middle Eastern fund manager. In New York, there are two significant sales reported to be pending to non-U.S. investors. A significant partial interest in 10 Hudson Yards, a new 1.8 million square foot office tower selling for a low 4s, initial cap rate is nearly $1,200 a square foot and 550 Madison Avenue, an 850,000 square foot office building that was being vacated for residential conversion is trading for approximately $1,800 a square foot. And lastly in San Francisco, 140 New Montgomery, a 300,000 square foot older, but fully renovated Class A office building in the SoMa district leased at current market rents sold to a U.S. investor for approximately 4.8 cap rate and over $960 a foot, a record price per square foot in San Francisco. As with the fixed income market, our perception is pricing for risker assets, whether in non-core locations and/or acquiring lease-up for renovation has softened to a degree in 2016. Long-term interest rates are low and cap rate spreads, the treasuries are above long-term averages, both of which provide strong support to real estate valuations. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, the relatively high investment yields and cash flow stability provided by high quality real estate assets will continue to be an attractive investment alternative to fixed income. Now moving to our capital strategy, it remains unchanged and that we're investing more in new developments and redevelopments than in stabilized acquisitions and these investments will be funded partially by select asset dispositions in the balance with debt financing. On acquisitions, we continue to actively review and are seeing an increase, for the reasons I mentioned earlier in value-add and development opportunities in our core markets. This past quarter, we purchased 218,000 square foot office building on Peterson Way in Santa Clara, California for $78 million. The asset is in infilled location with increasing density, it\u2019s 100% leased to a single tenant through 2021. During the remaining lease term, we plan to entitle the property for approximately of 630,000 square foot office campus. So the way to think about pricing is we\u2019re paying $123 a square foot for un-entitled land, while receiving a 4.6% cash yield, as we entitle and prelease a new upsize office complex. We are also working on several additional acquisitions of sites and value-add office buildings. On dispositions, in the first quarter as previously discussed, we completed the sale of 7 Kendall Center to MIT for $105 million. We continue to pursue select sales of non-core assets and maintain our estimate of 2016 asset sales of $200 million to $250 million. Moving to development, we remain very active, primarily in the execution of our predevelopment pipeline. In terms of forecasting potential starts for the balance of 2016, it will remain highly dependent on securing preleasing for entitled sites. The potential starts for 2016 include Springfield Metro Center where we're pursuing a requirement with the TSA, Reston Block 5 located in the Reston Town Center and 20 CityPoint, the mirror building to 10 CityPoint being developed in Waltham, these three projects aggregate 1.1 million square feet. We've been very active in this past quarter, advancing our predevelopment pipeline for projects that would start beyond 2016. Several important updates are as follows; as mentioned last quarter, in Cambridge at year-end 2015, 940,000 square feet of additional entitlements were made available for our Kendall Center development. We are in advanced discussions with multiple office users to fully prelease the 540,000 square foot office component of the entitlements. The balance of the project will be high-rise residential. The project is complex, involving replacing two smaller existing buildings on the site and will likely commence in 2017. Given we are not acquiring additional land, this project is another great example of the embedded development value in many of our existing assets. You\u2019ve probably read about our initial submission to the City of Boston for the development of additional sites at the Back Bay Station. We are already managing the concourse level of Back Bay Station as part of our agreement with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation. The project is in an early phase and could ultimately represent 1.3 million square feet of office retail and residential space located adjacent to a major Boston transit hub. The project is obviously subject to local approvals and public review and would not commence prior to late 2017. You have also probably read that we've been designated by the MTA as developer for their site located at 343 Madison Avenue, between 44th and 45th Streets in New York. The site is the western half of a full city block between Madison and Vanderbilt Avenues, and offers direct access to Grand Central Station and the new Long Island Railroad station at Grand Central Terminal. We will acquire a 99 year ground lease and build up to a 900,000 square foot office tower, subject to a number of local approvals and ULURP. The development of this property is likely several years out, but we\u2019ve commenced our predevelopment work. As discussed, we are also conducting a significant upgrade of portions of our portfolio. These redevelopment projects that we're executing include 399 Park, the low rise building at 601 Lex in New York, 1330 Connecticut Avenue, Metropolitan Square, and the Prudential Center retail.  At the end of the first quarter, our development pipeline consisted of 11 new projects and one redevelopment, representing 4.6 million square feet and $2.6 billion in projected cost. Our budgeted NOI for these projects remains in excess of 7% and the commercial component of the pipeline is 61% pre-leased. We have all the cash, $1.4 billion, required to complete the development of the portfolio, which should add materially to our Company\u2019s growth over the next four years. Moving for a moment to comment on governance, we recently announced in our proxy that Mort Zuckerman will retire as Chairman of the Board and become Chairman Emeritus of Boston Properties. Ivan Seidenberg will also retire from our Board and Joel Klein will become our lead Independent Director. We were also very pleased to be able to recruit Karen Dykstra and Bruce Duncan as Independent Directors of our Board. So, in conclusion, we remain very enthusiastic about our prospects for success and ability to create shareholder value for the balance of 2016 and in future years. We have a very clear plan that we\u2019ll improve and lease our existing assets, as well as add new buildings through development to our portfolio. All of which we expect to result in attractive FFO growth over the coming years. We have selected non-core assets for sale to ensure continued portfolio refreshment. We have significant entitled and unentitled land holding that we will continue to push through the design and permitting process and add selectively to our development pipeline in future years. Our balance sheet is strong with a net debt to EBITDA ratio below six times and with a substantial portion of our upcoming debt maturities having now been either refinanced or hedge. This strong capital position will also allow us to pursue and act on investment opportunities that may present themselves in coming quarters. Now let me turn it over to Doug for further review our markets. Doug Linde : Thanks Owen, good morning everybody. The market color that I am going to give this morning is pretty consistent with our last few calls, albeit there are few subtle changes, but I want to just sort of level status-quo what I\u2019ve said previously and I\u2019ll do that real quickly. So what we\u2019ve said before is that San Francisco has slowed from the pace that it was going at in 2014 and 2015, the Silicon Valley continues to be very active and actually has been expanding, New York is a good market, but it\u2019s been impacted by growing supply and there has been some impact of the financial service market volatility on small tenant demand, the Washington DC is a challenged market and there is not much evidence of improvement, so the Reston area continues to be pretty active and there is a little bit of growth there, and Boston suburban and Cambridge are seeing increasing demand, while the CBD is a healthy market, but it\u2019s really been more driven by lease expirations and intermittent technology migration. So that sort of levels what I\u2019ve said previously. Let me start now with the Silicon Valley and given that Peterson Way was just purchased, give you some sense of the thesis around this state and our views of the Valley. So having sold innovation place last quarter, our portfolio unfortunately is pretty small down there. It\u2019s really comprise of our 5,700 square feet of Mountain View single storey product where we actually completed another 8,900 square foot of leases this quarter with average starting rents of $50 triple net, which is more than double the expiring rents on that space. And then we have our standalone office building down in Mountain View, which is only 141,000 square foot and we have our land redevelopment parcel on North First in San Jose, that\u2019s the totality of our portfolio down there. The difficultly we\u2019ve been having over the last four-five years is finding high quality buildings or sites with an acceptable basis/return ratio. And the Peterson Way site offers an opportunity for us to deliver products in 2023 at a cost basis of under $700 of square foot and that assumes cost escalation on the cost side of the equation in terms of our building materials, labor, et cetera, and an initial return in excess of 7% at rents that are less than 10% above market rents today. So we have a market where there was 29 million square feet of gross leasing and user activity in 2015, the market size is about 240 million square feet, so it\u2019s a market we definitely want to be a part of and there was 11 million square feet of absorption in 2015. In the first quarter there were another eight leases over 100,000 square feet each, including 275,000 square feet from Google and another 200,000 square feet from Apple, and those are clearly the two dominant users of space and they\u2019ve had a dramatic influence on the market, but there are lots of other companies down there like Facebook, NVIDIA, Broadcom and VMware and Palo Alto Networks, that are really leaders in their perspective fields, and these are growing companies and what they are looking for is new modern efficient product to house their growth. So this is what we are going to hopefully build and this is the demand that we are going to satisfy. Jumping over to the city, as we discussed in our call in January, leasing velocity in the San Francisco CBD has moderated from the levels we saw in 2014 and early 2015, and so that\u2019s been a continuation into the beginning of 2016. I think the big difference between the market then i.e. in 2014 and 2015 and today is really the lack of large growth requirements, and by that I mean big tenants over 300,000 square feet. So at the moment, there is no 300,000 square foot greater requirement that we are tracking in the market. In 2013, 2014 and 2015, you had unprecedented large growth from Google, and Dropbox, and Salesforce.com, and Uber, and Stripe, and Slack, and LinkedIn, and they\u2019re just not there today. However, there continues to be lots of active tech demand. And in the first quarter, Airbnb and Twilio and Quantcast and Stripe all took down blocks over 100,000 square feet each, and just in April Lyft, and FitBit and Uber have combined leased over 500,000 square feet and much of that actually was from the sublet markets. So technology is still a vibrant part of the market, it\u2019s still expanding, it\u2019s not quite in the same manner that it was in 2014 and 2015. And interestingly, technology users now make up 31% of all of the space leased in the City of San Francisco. The second change in the CBD market in San Francisco has been the velocity from startups. If you look at the venture investing statistics, the seed in early stage investing is down about 22% quarter-to-quarter from prior year and first time investing is down 31%. And if you look at the city\u2018s sublet statistics, the overall level is very low at about 1.4 million square feet, but there are significant amount of full floor availability between 12,000 and 15,000 square feet across the South Financial and the SoMa areas. This is the product that\u2019s most attractive to the startup community. Keep in mind that most sublet has limited term, so it\u2019s not competing with the lease expiration-driven requirement from traditional tenants, which is where we are working at Embarcadero Center. So at EC, we completed another 128,000 square feet of leasing during the quarter, full floor tenants totaled 90,000 square feet of that 128,000, and net tenants coming into Embarcadero Center totaled 85,000 square feet of that 128,000. The mark-to-market on these larger transactions is between 40% and 70% on a gross basis, very consistent with what we\u2019ve been seeing for the last couple of quarters and is obviously a dramatic mark up in our same store statistics this quarter. The pipeline of leases that we have going in negotiation today at EC continues to be robust, a 150,000 square feet of additional leases in negotiation, 66,000 square feet of that is either new tenants or expansions. We also have active discussions with new tenants for an additional four vacant floors totaling 100,000 square feet. So with very, very busier Embarcadero Center, I would say however that relevant to the end of 2015 when activity was described as its strongest it is ever been in the history of our ownership, the pace of new tours has moderated a little bit. We\u2019ve signed additional leases for floor to Salesforce Tower, a 180,000 square feet which is in our statistics today, so our occupancy is 59% and the next wave lease proposals are progressing and include some single floor users, as well as large tenants between two and four floors. All of the discussions involve pending late 2017 and 2018 lease expirations. The steel in the core are rising into the San Francisco skylines, and we hope to have our first tenants and occupancy in late 2017 or early 2018. Now based on conversations we\u2019ve had with shareholders and analysts recently, I think it\u2019s fair to say that there has been a prevalence of concern about the next market I'm going to talk about which is Midtown Manhattan. Now our perspective has been pretty consistent since 2014, when we recognized there was going to be a supply issue from both new construction and the impending relocations that would impact lease economics. There continues to be good, not great leasing activity across the city and there are still tenant expansions across diverse industry group, including examples of financial services companies within our portfolio that are expanding today. Some of the more recent transactions in the marketplace from an expansion perspective have included Facebook and CBS Broadcasting, Vox Media, Google, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Shroders, and Chubb.  In January, we talked about the fact that the public capital market volatility was impacting the decision making from small financial firms. And the first quarter was certainly a rollercoaster for the debt and the equity markets. These conditions impact velocity at the high end, which is predominantly a small financial services firm demand pool. Across the market in the first quarter, there were five relocation transactions written at starting rent over $100 of square foot and that includes the Citadel lease at 425 Park. So if you remove the Citadel transaction, the average lease was 10,000 square feet, so four leases 10,000 square feet on average. There was clearly a change in the market in the first quarter. During the quarter, we completed 14 deals for about 173,000 square feet, over 100,000 square feet of our demand had starting rents over a $100 of square foot. They were all renewals and explore expansions. While we continue to see a constant and steady volume of leasings between $80 and $120 of square foot, the velocity above $125 of square foot have slowed. We\u2019ve been successful leasing small unit across the portfolio for a number of years and we are going to take a very similar approach for the two General Motors floors we get back on July 1st, subdividing them for smaller customers as required. Our discussions regarding the entire FAO block continue to be very, very active, given the magnitude of the commitment by the perspective tenants, this will take some time, but we hope to have a firm signed lease later this year. Last quarter, we announced our lease termination transaction at 250, West 55th Street, and while we have not signed a lease on any of that place in the last 90 days, we have significant conversations underway for the entire second floor and a number of food operators have presented proposals for the ground floor space. So the activity on that take back is stronger than we anticipated. At 399 Park, we are in lease negotiations with two existing tenants that would expand and commit to about 175,000 square feet of the city space rolling over in 2017, a 125,000 square feet of that demand represents expansions by these tenants. And we\u2019ve had some questions about the rollup and roll down of the office space that city is going to be leading in 2017, and our expectation is that it\u2019s going to be pretty moderate with very slight rollup. So as an example, we completed a four floor extension on one of the floors that is in question and the rollup was about 3.75% on a gross basis, i.e. pretty flat. This quarter, our New York City portfolio, CBD portfolio had a rollup of over 35% on a gross basis, so clearly 399 is one of the more moderate pieces of that. Mike made some significant enhancements to our supplement package this quarter and he is going to discuss those, but the one I want to point out is the delineation of our share of the portfolio NOI by market. In the case of our Washington DC region, it illustrates what we\u2019ve been saying for some time which is that our Washington DC, CBD portfolio is 9.5% of the company\u2019s NOI. We\u2019ve seen a number of comments suggesting that the DC office market has turned the corner. Our view is that there has been no demonstrable change in the leasing environment. Most of the DC law firms have completed their new installations, between 2016 and 2019, we are tracking only one law firm expiration over a 100,000 square feet. The good news is that there is likely to get little impact on any downsizing under market, the bad news is that they\u2019re selectively being generated from this sector. The GSA continues to be a very \u2013 take a very measure approach to their renewals, it is now hunkering into what we refer to as election inertia, which contributes to pushing our decisions. In spite of the challenging environment, we did complete a 117,000 square foot lease at WeWork at Met Square this quarter, as well as get another 17,000 square feet of the uncommitted space at 601 Mass Avenue leased. This quarter we also completed a 60,000 square foot renewal in Reston Town Center, starting rents in the mid-50s and five smaller transactions totaling 17,000 square feet. Reston continues to be 97% leased.  One green shoot in the Washington DC and Northern Virginia marketplace comes from a group of midsize technology tenants that are slowly expanding. We have a few of the tenants in our Reston portfolio, some direct and actually some subtenants and they are prime candidates for that next building in Town Center that Owen mentioned. The Boston region continues to be a magnet for life science industry and established tech companies, as well as for startup technology and maker organizations, this has led to a continual improvement and leasing momentum in the greater Boston market this quarter. Leasing velocity in the Waltham/Lexington submarket in particular has accelerated during the last few months, as a result of this type of demand and much of it is organic expansion.  When we purchased Bay Colony in 2011, it was about 50,000 square feet of technology tenant and no life science companies in the park. Today, we have over 500,000 square feet of these users and almost every one of them is in an expansion mode. This quarter, we completed another 179,000 square feet in our suburban portfolio and we have responded to more than 500,000 square feet of additional proposals over the last months. Virtually every pharma company has put down a base in the Cambridge market and coupled with a growth of the biotech industry and a tech tighten that are there, we have a market where the availability rate is under 5%. We are in active lease discussions as Owen described on 100% of our recently permitted commercial density, which will likely involve terminating some leases and potentially taking down some existing buildings in order to accommodate the new growth. We expect to make our site specific applications this year with a potential construction commencement in early 2017. And again, as Owen said, as part of this new development, we will also build additional residential high rise product. The Boston CBD continues to be a very steady market and supply has been absorbed over the last few years, though there is some specular development going on in the seaport area. While we do have a few technology tenants expanding into the overall market, much of the demand is still leased expiration driven. General Electric is going to be moving into a combination of new construction and rehab buildings currently owned by P&G and not utilizing existing inventory.  This quarter, we completed over 520,000 square feet of leasing and that includes the work that we did in 100 Federal Street, which is about 400,000 square feet of that. We also did 28,000 square feet at the top of 200 Clarendon and 50,000 square feet at the Prudential Center. Activity at 120 St. James where we have 170,000 square feet of availability has picked up dramatically, and although we haven\u2019t signed any leases, we have a number of tenants reviewing their auctions at the building and they range from between 32,000 square feet which will be partial floor to the entire 170,000 square foot block. All of those tenants would have occupancy in late 2017 or early 2018. Last quarter we provided a score card for our revenue bridge. We continue to make progress and with additional transaction this quarter, leasing at Embarcadero Center, the Prudential Tower, 200 Clarendon and 250 West 55th, we\u2019ve accomplished about $48 million of that $80 million bridge. And with I\u2019ll turn the floor over to Mike. Mike LaBelle : Thanks Doug. Good morning everybody. As Doug mentioned we made some changes to our supplemental financial report this quarter that I\u2019d like to go over. The purpose was really to more clearly reflect the characteristics and performance of our share of the portfolio, given the sizable impact of the consolidated joint ventures that we have put in place in the last couple of years. In addition to delineating the geographic and tenant diversification in this manner, we\u2019ve included supplemental information in our same property NOI performance pages to include both the consolidated portfolio performance that we\u2019ve historically provided, as well as the performance of our share of the portfolio. You will also note that we\u2019ve folded our R&D segment into our office segment this quarter due to the immaterial size of the R&D portfolio, especially after the sale of 415 Main Street in Cambridge during the first quarter. Lastly, as Owen mentioned, we\u2019re embarking on several significant repositioning projects within the portfolio, which we consider non-recurring in nature. In our capital expenditure disclosure and the supplemental, we\u2019re now segregating the capital spend for these projects which have a total budget of approximately $165 million to be spent over the next few years. Now turning to our results for the quarter, as you can see from our press release, we reported first quarter funds from operations of $1.63 per share, which is $0.03 per share, about $5 million higher than the midpoint of our guidance range. The performance of our portfolio drove approximately $4 million of this outperformance with about half of it coming from faster than projected leasing activity. We continue to successfully execute early renewals at Embarcadero Center and in our Mountain View properties at a significant rent roll up that are streamlined into our revenues upon lease signing. We also incurred earlier than projected occupancy from new leasing and smaller pieces across the portfolio. Approximately $2 million of the improvement resulted from lower than projected operating expenses that stemmed from warmer than normal weather conditions in the Northeast, which reduced our utilities expense a little bit, as well as the deferral of repair and maintenance expenses that we project will be incurred later this year. On development and management services fee income, we were approximately $1 million ahead of our projections, the majority relates to higher than anticipated service income generated in the portfolio. We also signed an agreement to act as development manager for the tenant that acquired our former Innovation Place project in North San Jose, and we will earn a multiyear development fee for worth that commenced this quarter. Our first quarter same property performance was solid, with the combined portfolio cash NOI up 5.6% and GAAP NOI up 1.5% from the first quarter last year. As I mentioned, the company's share of NOI growth differs from the combined results and if you pull out the non-controlling interest share, our share of the portfolio performance is even better. This quarter our share of cash NOI growth was 7% and GAAP NOI growth was 2.8% in 2015, which is the new level of detail we provided on Page 41 of the supplemental under the heading adjusted combined. As we look out to the remainder of 2016, we project our same property growth to moderate through the year. Our same property cash NOI growth will be impacted by free rent that was in place in the first quarter of 2015, but burned off during the year. And both GAAP and cash NOI will be negatively impacted by the pending vacancy of 70,000 square feet in the mid-rise at 757 Fifth Avenue and 150,000 square feet at 601 Lexington Avenue where we\u2019ve completed a series of lease terminations and relocations that will allow us to redevelop the low-rise building starting later this year. We expect this portion of the building to be out of service for about two years. The redevelopment will result in a longer period of downtime, but in late 2018 when we reintroduce both the new retail and low-rise building to the market, we expect it will enhance the long-term value and future cash flow from the building. Our leasing activity in the portfolio is steady and generally in line with our prior projections. Overall, we\u2019ve modestly increased our combined same property NOI growth projections for GAAP NOI, but we still project roughly breakeven growth from 2015, and we continue to expect our combined same property cash NOI growth to be 1% to 3% from 2015.  Again, when you remove the non-controlling interest share from the consolidated portfolio, our share of growth for both GAAP and cash is projected to be 100 basis points higher. The increase in our GAAP NOI projection is reflected in our guidance for non-cash straight line rents, which is now $40 million to $55 million for the full year. We acquired Peterson Way this quarter with a plan to complete entitlement and develop the site in the future. In the meantime the building is a 100% leased for the next five years and it\u2019s projected to generate approximately a 4.6% cash return and a 5.8% GAAP return. As a result, we\u2019ve increased our 2016 guidance for the incremental NOI contribution from our non-same property portfolio that includes our new developments and our acquisitions to $38 million to $44 million. The projected 2016 incremental contributions from these developments and acquisitions for 2016 represents 3% year-over-year growth on our share of the total portfolio NOI. We also increased our guidance for development and management services income by $2 million at the midpoint and now project services income of $22 million to $26 million for the year. The impact of these changes results in our increasing our guidance range for 2016 funds from operations to $5.85 to $5.95 per share. This is an increase of $0.05 per share at the midpoint, consisting of $0.02 per share from better projected portfolio performance, $0.02 from acquisitions and $0.01 from higher projected development and management services income. That completes our formal remarks. I\u2019d appreciate if the operator would open up the lines for any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citi. Emmanuel Korchman : Maybe if can we just stick to New York City for a second and we think about the Madison Avenue corridor, that sounds like it's going to have a bunch of new supply coming on if all these projects go forward over the next few years. Do you think that that submarket can handle the new supply coming from One Vanderbilt, if we classify it as Madison, MTA site, and now Sony coming back to office? Doug Linde : So you just mentioned three projects, one of them is the existing building and the other two are new development. I can\u2019t comment on the timing of the One Vanderbilt, but I think that the MTA site is a site that will take some time to go through entitlement, and hopefully over time that the city of New York have a demand generator that allows us to start that building with a significant pre-leasing commitment associated with it. I think that the challenge with New York City, and I will let John Powers comment on this, is that while there are plenty of tenants who are paying above $100 a square foot, there are not a lot of big tenants that would be anchored tenants that would be paid over $100 a square foot in size. And so, I think the market has to be naturally positioned to accommodate the demand that is there as opposed to a hope that simply rising rents will be achieved by the traditional large scale tenant demand that the city currently sees. John, do you want to comment anymore? John Powers : No, I think you have it Doug. On the Madison comment, as you said there is a big timing difference, 550 is vacant now, and the MTA site has to go through the whole Euler process, so their objective is to have that done when East site access comes, which is 2021, it\u2019s a long way from now. Emmanuel Korchman : If we switch course for a second, given your positive commentary on Silicon Valley in Santa Clara specifically, can your express your interest or your views on the Yahoo site that seems to be coming to market? Doug Linde : Bob, do you want to take that one. Bob Pester : Yeah, it\u2019s a big site. They\u2019re looking for approximately $300 million, it\u2019s not a bad site. We think the site that we purchased is a smaller and more manageable and closer to the center of activity. The Yahoo site has been on the market for quite some time, so that will tell you how many buyers are out there for a $300 million site. Emmanuel Korchman : I will take it that you\u2019re not a likely buyer there? Bob Pester : No, I don\u2019t see there is a likely buyer at this time. Emmanuel Korchman : Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Market. John Kim : Your cash pre-leasing spreads at 26% was more than double what you achieved last year, would you characterize this as unusually high this quarter or a reflection of what you\u2019re seeing for the remaining of the year? Doug Linde : So, the challenge with our pre-leasing spreads is that they\u2019re so dependent upon the particular portion of the portfolio that\u2019s rolling over at any one time. So we may have a quarter where we have much more significant growth and then we may have a quarter where we have a much more muted perspective because of the specifics associated with \u2013 again the granularity of that. In general, the dominant quarter is relative to its San Francisco rollover, the higher that numbers will be because on average there is \u2013 it is probably somewhere around 50% or 55% mark-to-market on virtually everything that we are doing in Embarcadero Centre, so as that gets a larger portion of each particular quarter that\u2019s what\u2019s driving it, and then I think the second area would be our New York portfolio at new General Motors building where we have significant embedded upside, so when those things rollover into the market you\u2019re going to see a much higher number and then our Cambridge portfolio where there is a significant embedded upside, those are the sort of three portions of the market, where when they hit the statistics in any one quarter they will push it in the right direction. John Kim : So outside of those buildings there would be more of a 10% to 15% number? Doug Linde : I wish I could give you specific number, I just can\u2019t because it\u2019s really dependent upon the granularity, there is not much in the way of roll up on our CBD portfolio. So if 100% of that was occurring in anyone typical quarter it will be more muted. John Kim : Okay. And then can I ask you about 767 Fifth Avenue, more on the re-financing side with a fair amount of debt due next year. I know you swapped \u2013 swap rates are part of it earlier this year, but can you talk about the overall financing strategy next year and if you\u2019re planning to utilize similar amount of debt of the mortgage mezzanine debt? Doug Linde : I mean, I think that the amount of debt we will be able to get will be at least equal to what is there and it will all be senior. We won\u2019t need the used mezzanine debt to get to that level. The cash flow that property has grown pretty dramatically over the last 10 years that we owned it, as we\u2019ve rolled up rents pretty consistently over that timeframe and there is still \u2013 it\u2019s still under rented from a lease rate perspective. So from a debt underwriting perspective, lenders will be comfortable with the cash flow characteristics and the future cash flow characteristics, it\u2019s obviously a large loan. So that\u2019s the biggest challenge with it, is that the current financing is $1.6 billion, it\u2019s naturally going to be good for the CMBS market, CMBS market can easily handle a loan of that size typically, but that market has been a little more volatile over the last six to nine months. Although I would say that most of the volatility is when you start to get into the higher leverage points, so when you\u2019re talking about a loan that is 40% to 50% leverage, that market is more -- is a better place to be today than if you\u2019re talking about a loan that is 60% to 65% leverage. So we could finance this loan today in the CMBS market based upon the leverage point that we have. The existing loan is indicative of bunch of banks and insurance companies, so it\u2019s also possible to execute in that type of environment where you would have somebody help you put together a large syndicate. So I think there is a couple of different ways for us to tackle this, it doesn\u2019t expire until the end of 2017, so obviously there is time, but we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve put in some hedges for about a third of the exposure at this point. So that\u2019s kind of where I see that standing. John Kim : And can you remind us what the on cost of that is versus where you think you could refinance it? Doug Linde : So that debt on a cash basis is 6% debt. On a GAAP basis because of the \u2013 when we consolidated this thing the GAAP debt is about 3%. I would say the CMBS market today for 50% financing is somewhere in the high 3s to 4.25, and as you go leverage say towards 60% and kind of get into that 4.5 level, so that\u2019s a significant reduction I would see from a cash interest basis based upon current interest rates. John Kim : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jamie Feldman : Good morning. I guess to start, can you talk about leasing prospects for 888 Boylston, which is coming online in the third quarter. Doug Linde : Sure, so the 888 Boylston Street is a 17 storey building and floors three through 11, and floors 15, 16, and 17 are already committed and leased, and so we have four floors left and I think we have strong interest in the building from anyone who comes to the building and looks at it because the design and development group here have created a building that is paramount to the most sustainable, exciting, innovative building that the City of Boston has ever seen. And the issue is that we\u2019re going to \u2013 we\u2019re looking for premium rent, and so the number of tenants that are prepared to pay a premium rent is a smaller number than the average of the marketplace, and so we have to be patient with regards to the progress that we\u2019re going to make at least in that space, as what our expectations are. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And in terms of the on 2016 guidance, I guess there is none \u2013 2017? Doug Linde : Yeah. The large tenants in the building are coming into the building from a rent commencement in 2017, I think there is about 75,000 square feet that could hit the fourth quarter with the top three floors. Mike LaBelle : That\u2019s already in our guidance and I think it\u2019s a 25 that\u2019s in 2016, and then a couple of those other floors are in the beginning of 2017, and then the anchor tenant is towards the end of 2017. Jamie Feldman : Okay. Then I appreciate the color on San Francisco and the Bay Area. Can you guys talk a little more about supply, like how you guys are thinking about the competitive supply both in San Francisco and in the Valley? Doug Linde : Bob, you want to take that one? Bob Pester : Yeah, in San Francisco, I mean, right now in addition to Salesforce Tower there is the 181 Fremont project in Block 5, which is under construction. I don\u2019t see anything else coming out of the ground that\u2019s entitled in the Central SoMa district or the SoMa district or the Downtown any time soon, so that\u2019s the main competition that we have. Mission Bay does have the Kilroy project that's under construction. But we really don\u2019t think that anyone that\u2019s going to be looking at that project is going to be looking at our project at Salesforce Tower. And then down in Valley, there is numerous projects that are under construction and planned several million square feet and we think that will offer opportunities for tenants to expand in and temper the vacancy rate somewhat from a standpoint of possibly increasing. But in San Francisco overall there is the very little competition that\u2019s going to come into play in Prop M, obviously is going to have an impact on future development because there is nothing that\u2019s being resolved on Prop in one way or another and I don\u2019t see anything getting resolved on it in the near future. Jamie Feldman : Okay. But I guess going back to the comments about not that many large tenants looking for space right now, how do you think about some of the buildings that are under construction in the CBD, that space going \u2013 that space getting leased? Do you think they will sit for a while or we'll see that stuff get leased up pretty quickly once it's done? Doug Linde : We\u2019ve heard there is a couple of Silicon Valley users that have looked at Block 5, they have a no commitment. 181 is a smaller \u2013 a much smaller floor plate building, so whether that appeals the tech remains to be seen. I can only talk from the standpoint of the activity that we\u2019re seeing at Salesforce Tower and we continue to do tours weekly and presentations weekly and we continue to exchange paper proposals within it, you know we hope in the next \u2013 by the next quarterly call that we\u2019ll have done hopefully another 100,000 square feet in leases. Jamie Feldman : Okay. Then finally for Mike LaBelle, can you just talk about what the new guidance means for AFFO and dividend coverage for the year? Mike LaBelle : So yeah, I\u2019m happy to, you know our AFFO is going to be better than it was last year where we had a lot of pre-rent. So pre-rent last year was a well over $100 million, so this year\u2019s pre-rent guidance is $40 million to $55 million, so that\u2019s going to be a benefit to it. I mean I would say on a per share basis, the way we calculate FAD in our supplemental, we expect it to be similar in the $415 million to $440 million range. You\u2019re talking \u2013 in order to meet our occupancy guidance that we\u2019re going to have leasing cost of somewhere in the $150 million range, and CapEx of \u2013 on a recurring CapEx basis, somewhere $75 million to $90 million, which is pretty similar to last year, maybe a little bit higher. Jamie Feldman : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors. Jed Reagan : Morning, guys. You mentioned seeing a slowdown in high-end tenant demand in New York City this past quarter. Just with some of the market volatility settling down in the past couple months, are you seeing signs of those types of tenants getting more active again? Doug Linde : I\u2019ll start and I\u2019ll let John comment. So I actually \u2013 I talked to a handful of brokers in the third week in January, and then I talked to them again last week. And I think to describe their personality is somewhat manic, on the good and the bad. And the number of tours that is occurring right now in the greater Midtown small tenant market is significantly accelerated versus where it was when the Dow and the credit markets were a little bit more in turmoil. John, do you have any other perspective? John Powers : No, I mentioned on the last call that we had this in August and the beginning of September when the equity markets had a lot of jitters and spread and widened in the bond market. And we had the same thing happen in January, but it didn\u2019t stick with leasing market in the fall and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to stick with the leasing market now. Certainly on the high-end financial hedge funds et cetera, they\u2019re very, very close to that market and when there is issues there they have concerns. Jed Reagan : Okay. That's helpful. Just switching to DC, can you talk about your outlook for DC beyond 2016 as far as leasing activity and rent growth is concerned? Do you think that's a market that turns the corner in a noticeable way in 2017 and 2018, let's say, following the election? Doug Linde : I will take a crack at it and then Peter can add to it. Well we lack in DC that you hear in the other markets are kind of unexpected demand drivers. Right now, we\u2019re still pre-dominantly lease expiration driven market, so we\u2019re going to look in advance and see where the demand is coming from, from existing tenants and thus match up relative supplies, is pretty equal. We\u2019re not going to see a tremendous increase in vacancy, nor are we going to see a tightness, it\u2019s a pretty balanced picture right now, but what we really need is for the election to take place, clear the slate and look at some technology and some other demand drivers coming to the marketplace. Until that additional demand comes, we\u2019re going to be pretty status-quo market. Peter, do you have anything to add. Peter Johnston : I would certainly say, that\u2019s true, it relates to the election. I do think looking at the job growth numbers and looking at where the GSA has been, they\u2019ve been shedding that jobs and that has stabilized in the last 12 months and they\u2019re actually starting to add jobs again, which I think will be a positive, but as is always the case, the money won\u2019t start to flow till after the election for those things. Jed Reagan : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Blaine Heck : I guess Owen or Doug, just more generally, you guys talked about the development pipeline; but can you just talk more about where you think we are in the cycle, and how that pertains to the shadow development pipeline? Has your level of comfort going ahead with any of those projects changed as we've come through the cycle? And how do you think about the importance of pre-leasing at this point? Owen Thomas : I don\u2019t it\u2019s changed, but I do think it is shifting gradually. In terms of your question about the cycle obviously it\u2019s difficult for us to predict exactly when the cycle will end and when we\u2019ll have the next recession, there are number of people predicting it, in the near term, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re quite as concerned about a near term recession, but as I mentioned in my remarks growth is clearly slow and I think we anticipate that by continuing here for some period of time. But we\u2019re not blind to the prospects of a recession in the \u2013 certainly in the medium term. And then, what I mean by saying a shift, I do think our thinking about launching new development is shifting. I think our pre-let requirement is higher, it\u2019s difficult for us to say precisely that we need x percent for a building pre-let to launch it because it depends a lot on other factors, like where is the tenant coming from, what\u2019s the size of the building, what\u2019s the nature of the market at the time, so we don\u2019t set those kinds of fixed hurdles. But I do think as we look at our portfolio and we look at projects that we want to launch a pre-let requirement is clearly required and I mentioned in my remark three projects that we\u2019re looking at now for 2016, and we\u2019re not going to launch any of them without some kind of significant pre-let. Blaine Heck : Okay, that's helpful. Then it sounds like you guys are progressing well with the tenant for the FAO space. Can you give any estimate as to the potential NOI upside versus the temporary tenant that you have there, and maybe even versus what FAO was paying? Owen Thomas : We\u2019ve been reticent to talk about the specific economics of the deal. We\u2019ve talked in sort of big picture perspective about the income that\u2019s been generated by the overall resale space in the past at the General Motors building. I think we\u2019ve said in the past and if you could figure it out from our disclosure that the rent that FAO is paying was about $20 million a years and we think the number is significantly higher than that. Blaine Heck : Okay, great. Fair enough. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Doug or Owen, when we look at your occupancy by market, there is a real bifurcation in a couple places between the CBDs and the suburban\u2019s. And I am just wondering if you could sort of comment on Princeton, you know it's 75% occupied today versus your New York, which is 95%. You've obviously got a few things you talked about down in South San Francisco that may get cleared up. But then when you look at the Washington portfolio, you're doing well in DC, specifically in Reston, but then suburban Maryland. How do you think about those markets in particular? And maybe Ray can comment on the Annapolis Junction, which just doesn't seem to be getting much traction on the leasing front? Doug Linde : Sure. Let me take a quick stab at that, Steve, because it\u2019s a fair question. So the good news is that the occupancy number you're describing and the contribution from the properties that the occupancy number is significantly underweighted. In other words, if it were leased, it\u2019s the relative rent that it would achieve is de minimus relative to the rents that we are achieving in our CBD property. So as an example, the Washington DC vacancy is in our VA 95 product, and it\u2019s interesting, it\u2019s actually the first time in the 20 some odd years that we\u2019ve been a public company we\u2019ve had significant availability in that particular park, but the net rents that we are achieving here are $13 a square foot. The big pieces of availability in our portfolio are at Tower Center in New Brunswick, which is an excess of 300,000 square feet of that availability and then the property in South San Francisco at Gateway. So if you pull those three out, the VA 95, the Gateway and the Tower Center, we have a very different picture, but it is true that the majority of our challenge space is in the suburban marketplace. Steve Sakwa : Yeah. I guess, Doug, it just seems like it takes a lot of management effort for maybe not a lot of reward. And I guess is it worth longer-term keeping it versus focusing your efforts on other things in the portfolio? Owen Thomas : So Steve, it\u2019s a great point. Just to debate we constantly have as a management team. And I described a lot of investor\u2019s enthusiasm for real estate, but it\u2019s primarily for lease buildings in our core markets and there is less investor enthusiasm for unleased buildings in suburban market. So, our tradeoff is \u2013 we don\u2019t want to sell assets just to sell them at deeply discounted prices. We want to perform the real estate skill, lease the buildings, and get a proper price for them. And I would say if you go back and look at the asset sales that we\u2019ve done, clearly we\u2019ve done some of the large joint ventures on the urban assets, but mixed in with that, if you go back over the last couple of years, we have sold non-core assets in some of our suburban locations in Boston and in Washington DC. And also as Doug said, one of the things I just want to clarify when you talked about the Princeton vacancy, the Carnegie vacancy is \u2013 the Carnegie occupancy is 86% of all resident in that Tower Center as Doug described. Steve Sakwa : And I guess, any comment from Ray on just the Annapolis Junction? That just doesn't seem to be getting a lot of traction at this point. Ray Ritchey : I\u2019ll be glad to take a crack at that, Steve. First of all, again, we only own 50% of those buildings with our partners the Goulds, and we are seeing the NSA demand be focused more back on the base as oppose to reaching out to satellite office location. And the MegaCenter which was the main driver for the Annapolis Junction project, they changes the use of that that was like a \u2013 it was like WeWork for spies. It was a scenario where people would come in and have temporary occupancy. Those requirements are also getting moved back on the base. So we are seeing a slowdown in the demand, but again our presence there is relatively small on a relative basis to the overall Boston Properties Enterprise. Steve Sakwa : Okay. And I guess just one last question for Bob Pester. I know this is hard. You say there is not a lot of large requirements in the marketplace today, but what we've heard from brokers in the past is a lot of these large requirements are stealthfully done, maybe either away from the brokerage firm or directly with some landlords. Any perspective you can just sort of offer on that today? I realize if they're not on a brokerage list and maybe they're not in the market or you would know about them, but how should we think about that? Bob Pester : Yeah, I think that's a bunch of baloney, Steve. We haven\u2019t seen after the years we\u2019ve been in this marketplace where some mega deal happens that nobody knew about. Steve Sakwa : Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erin Aslakson with Stifel. Erin Aslakson : Good morning. So yeah, my question was kind of along the same lines, just regarding the Annapolis Junction asset. I realize it's 50% owned, but it had a huge loan-to-value in place, $339 a square foot. That we assume is being relocated on base. Is that what you were referring to, Ray? Ray Ritchey : Yeah, basically, Erin, they seemed to be concerned about security now more than ever. So the outreach to \u2013 again, third-party space providers is not as great as it was before. We still have a strong presence there. We are pretty well occupied in the other buildings of the MegaCenter and Mike wants to talk about the debt, you can go ahead and ask questions to him. Erin Aslakson : Okay, that's fine. Then that was on AJ One, where the big debt was in place. On AJ Seven, there was a one year extension done on the loan there, which is much more reasonable, $170 a square foot. But is there a lack of demand? I mean, that's a 100% leased asset, but is there some expectation that that tenancy goes away as well? Mike LaBelle : Was a short-term lease, and no, there is no anticipated vacancy. We just decided to stay short and kind of evaluate the overall positions as we go forward. That lease is actually \u2013 as Ray correctly stated to one year lease. However, the government invested about $40 million in technology and that building and for better or worse the nature of that Park, those one year leases are just the way they get allocated funding. So what they do is basically give you a one year deal and then nine one-year extensions. So we have every expectation that they are going to stay in that space. Erin Aslakson : Okay. And then how much did the government invest in the One Annapolis Junction asset? Mike LaBelle : Actually we put the bulk of that investment in, and as Ray described it really was a plug-in play skiff with raised flooring all the way down to the desktop, computers and a 24 hour operating entity in there which was first SAIC and is now Leidos one of their successful entities with staff, help desk, 24x7. And as Ray indicated, what happened \u2013 having met with the director of logistics and facilities early in this part of the year \u2013 earlier this year rather, they\u2019ve had a couple of security issues up there. There was a fidelity outside the base. There was obviously the Edward Snowden incident, and it has \u2013 I think scared them into moving certain requirements on base when they\u2019ve been able to do that. We are in the process now with Leidos of throttling back, based on our conversations with the logistics folks from NSA. The level of services that we\u2019ve been providing to a number that we can adjust the rent downward and take that part of the operating expense if you will. So where we\u2019ve been leasing space there in the $120 to $130 range, we just did a deal at $95, which quite frankly if can continue to do deals with that rate, I think we can put the building back on a pretty sound footing. Erin Aslakson : Okay. Is there any indication in the size of the amount of square footage going back on base in total? Mike LaBelle : They didn\u2019t really share that. They didn\u2019t really share that information with us. Erin Aslakson : Okay. Well, thank you, guys, very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Vincent Chao : Good morning, everyone. Just going back to San Francisco here for a second, I know we've talked about it quite a bit, but just curious. It does look like you got some leasing done at Salesforce Tower. Can you just comment on \u2013 and I think you said that you\u2019re hoping for another 100,000 square foot or so in the next couple of quarters. Just curious who is taking space there today? Obviously, the larger guys are not out there, but where is the demand coming from today? Owen Thomas : We\u2019ve talked about this in the past and it hasn\u2019t changed, but I want to just reiterate that. So all of the demand that we are seeing at Salesforce Tower is really lease expiration driven demand. I mean there maybe a couple of tenants that are in the market for a floor that have asked for a presentation, but it is a truly representative FIRREA-oriented group of tenants that are looking for high quality brand new visible state-of-the-art office space. So its brokerage firms, consulting firms, accounting firms, lawyers, investment professionals, asset managers, venture capitalists. That's sort of the laundry list of the type of users who are the most likely tenants to be in that building. Remember the first available floor is now 32, and so, you know, you're in the high-rise of high-rise office building in the clinical location in San Francisco. Vincent Chao : Okay; thanks for that. And then just maybe going back to the East Coast, just any comment you can provide on the Penn Station redevelopment, your interest and maybe the process from here? John Powers : We\u2019re not bidding on the Penn Station redevelopment. We looked at it carefully, there is two opportunities, one is Penn Station and the other is the Fairway Building. It\u2019s very complex, both of them are very complex. Penn is primarily exclusively a retail play and Fairway has a combination of retail, probably some hotel and office, but it\u2019s very complex. And as I said, we analyzed carefully and decided not to participate. Vincent Chao : Okay, thanks Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Alex Goldfarb : Good morning and thank you. Just two questions here. First, you guys obviously spoke a lot about Midtown and what's going on, and then also the growth out West. But looking at your portfolio mix, New York is still a pretty big component of BXP relative to the West Coast. And if we look at where a lot of the economic growth is, there seems to be a lot more coming out of the Bay Area versus New York. So should we expect more and more of the investment to be out West? Or should we expect it to be as it's been right now, where there is a West Coast investment announcement and at the same time you have a New York investment announcement as well? Owen Thomas : So Alex, we certainly think about our portfolio mix and our balance across the various regions as we think about making new investments and buildings or in developments. And for that reason if you pro-forma-ed what we\u2019re going to look like over the next few years, the San Francisco component of our overall results is going to grow materially, primarily driven by the sale \u2013 the delivery of the Salesforce Tower, but also by some of the other project that we delivered last year like 680, 690, 535 mission and so forth. So there has been a conscious effort and I think it\u2019s going to continue to be a conscious effort that we're going grow our company is areas where there is the greatest tenant demand, which today is technology and life sciences. So, the answer to your question is, yes, but I would also say that the investment that we make are also opportunity driven. So, you know, our team in each of the regions work vigorously on identifying new investments, switching our development pipelines forward. And so that we think about a top-down the actual allocation are also driven by where the opportunity is opportunities present themselves. Doug Linde : I mean, Alex, just if you take Salesforce Tower rate, it\u2019s 1.4 million square feet and if average gross rent in there is in the mid-80s, we are talking about $150 and $120 million of additional revenue, which is a significant jump in the overall percentage that San Francisco will have when the building is fully in service in 2018 or early 2019. I also think that \u2013 and I think we\u2019ve been pretty consistent in our description of this, which is we're a demand oriented company. We are looking to serve those users who are growing and where the demand is been generated. And to the extent that there is more demand and users that are sort of technology oriented and it happen to be in the West Coast. We\u2019re going to see everything we possibly can to service those companies. On other hand, New York City and the Boston and the Cambridge marketplace is in to some degree Northern Virginia also have a pretty interesting feature demand pool that we are going to try and serve as best we can as well. And so I think that we are going to be aggressive about making investments in all of those places where we think there is an opportunity there to find tenants who are growing and we are looking for high quality office space. Alex Goldfarb : Okay. And then the second question is, I think in your opening comments you said the activity down in Silicon Valley area is much more active than in San Francisco, did I hear correctly? Doug Linde : Yeah, I mean if you look at the activity in the Silicon Valley in 2015, the work what went on in San Francisco. Alex Goldfarb : Okay. Then my question is, how much of that is just where businesses are growing because of what's happening internally in the business versus there may be easier access to, quote-unquote, cheaper, more affordable housing that's causing people to maybe \u2013 down South maybe there's San Jose or South of there, there's more affordable housing for people versus the explosive residential rent growth that's been in San Francisco. So how much of it has been employee driven versus business driven? Doug Linde : So, I will make a few comments and then I will let Bob and Owen chime in. So, the first is that, Google and Apple are by far the most dominant users of office space in the Silicon Valley. And their headquarters is in the Silicon Valley and I think there\u2019s absolutely no expectation that whether that\u2019s going to change. I also think that, the number of people who are living in the city of San Francisco and that are using commuter oriented transit, mostly in the form of private buses to get to those campuses down in the Silicon Valley is very, very significant. And so I think that the value of the affordable housing is less critical to the growth of the Silicon Valley than the natural establishment of those campuses and those businesses in terms of historically where they have been and their ability to still be able to attract labor from the urban market, if they\u2019re looking for younger and more transit oriented types of opportunities. Bob, any other thoughts? Bob Pester : Yeah, I\u2019ll just add, I think the housing prices in the Silicon Valley have anything to do with the growth, I think all the growth is organic growth where they\u2019re growing and getting bigger. If they were looking about residential values they would move to the East Bay, because that\u2019s the cheapest housing in the Bay area. Alex Goldfarb : That's one heck of a commute. Listen, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick with Capital One Securities. Tom Lesnick :  Good morning; thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of quick ones. First, I understand it's a relatively small segment of your overall business, but it looks like the multifamily and hotel segment has been dragging on same-store NOI the last little bit here. What's your prognosis for that segment going forward? Mike LaBelle : I think on the same-store side our hotel was down a little bit that drove it this quarter. The challenge is, it\u2019s such a small portfolio that any kind of little change has an impact and also if you look at the residential page of our supplemental, the avenue is in one year and not in the other, so you really have to look at the same-store days, which is not as \u2013 it\u2019s not as bad because that excludes the avenue, which was sold during the year. The Avant and the Atlantic Wharf property, retro-wharf, have both stayed very, very well occupied year to year and continue to improve. Doug Linde : And I would also just add, we are interested in continuing to grow our residential portfolio, primarily through development. And if you look at our active pipeline and our pre-development pipeline, we have a number of projects that we anticipate, under construction now where we anticipate building, we talked a little about Reston, certainly in Cambridge, North Station; there are several examples to this around the company. Tom Lesnick : Got it, thanks. Then maybe one for Ray. It looks like you guys are introducing paid parking at Reston Town Center. Just wondering; is it possible for you to quantify the incremental revenue opportunity there? And are there any other opportunities across the entire portfolio where you could also realize upside potential? Ray Ritchey : I\u2019ll let Peter address that he\u2019s away more political than I on those type of investments, so go ahead Peter. Peter Johnston : Well, I don\u2019t think we want to get into necessarily quantifying it, I would say that there is approximately 8,000 parking spaces there. We undertook for a couple of reasons, obviously revenue is one, but we\u2019ve got a circumstance where we have to control to honor our obligations with both the retailers and the office tenants there, and people in adjacent resident parking in our space is so to speak, as well as commuter is doing the same thing. And part of implementing it now is we\u2019ve got enough runway that with the introduction of Metro proximate to Town Center probably in about three, three and a half years. We want to be in a position where this system is up and running. It\u2019s going to be a licensed plate recognition system, you\u2019ll be using an app to park there and we think it\u2019s going to be a pretty significant enhancement for our customer base coming to the Town Center. Doug Linde : One point I would like to make is we talked to some other major retailers about the experience of implementing paid parking and after the fact they actually noted an increase in sales of up to 10% of the retailers because the people who do come to the malls now find it way more convenient and as a result spend more time there and spend more dollars. So we view it as a great thing for our retailers and our office tenants and the income we get will certainly be helpful, but by no means the main driver. Tom Lesnick : Interesting, I appreciate the insight. That's all I've got. Operator : We have time for one final question and that question comes from Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Craig Mailman : Thanks, guys. Just curious, going back to San Francisco, your commentary on it being a little bit slower. Just curious if that's filtered in, impact at all, rent level discussions as you're trying to fill up the rest of Salesforce? Doug Linde : It actually hasn\u2019t, the overall availability in San Francisco I think is under 6% right now. And I think what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve tried to price all of our product appropriately for the market, we are not striding to set record for the sake of setting records, where we think we are hitting the market bid and we are doing it pretty consistently because we\u2019re acting a true, honest market price that both the tenant and the landlord feel good about. And so we\u2019ve not seen any diminishing in our pricing component of our concession package and rental rate economics over the past three to four months. Craig Mailman : That's helpful. Then just lastly, down at Peterson Way, I know it's a longer fuse on this one, but would this be spec or build-to-suit? Doug Linde : I would hope that it will be build-to-suit, but in 2023 we\u2019ll be in a different environment, so we\u2019ll see where we are when we get there. Craig Mailman : Great. Thank you. Owen Thomas : So that concludes the questions and our formal remarks. Thank you for your time this morning and your interest in Boston Properties. Operator : This concludes today's Boston Properties conference call. Thank you again for attending and have a great day",

During the question-and-answer of our call, our regional management teams will be available to address any questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks. Owen Thomas : Okay, thank you, Arista. Good morning, everyone. As usual, I will cover our quarterly results, the macro market conditions as we see them as well as our current capital strategy and investment activity. On current results, we produced another strong quarter with FFO per share $0.04 above consensus primarily due to accelerated lease termination income. We have also increased the midpoint of our full year 2016 FFO per share guidance by $0.06. In the quarter, we leased 925,000 square feet, nearly half of that in the New York region and this quarterly volume is above historical averages by number of leases but below on total square feet. Our portfolio occupancy is now 90.8%, down 20 basis points from the end of the first quarter. We had another quarter of strong rent rollups in our leasing activity with rental rates on leases that commenced in the second quarter up 18% on a gross basis and 28% on a net basis compared to prior lease. As we anticipated our leasing spreads continue to be strongest in San Francisco and Boston and positive in all regions. Now, moving to the economy, U.S. economic growth continues to be sluggish and slowing. First quarter GDP has been reported at 1.1%, down from 1.4% in the fourth quarter of last year and estimates for all of 2016 are approximately 2% after downward revisions. The employment picture has been recently healthy with 287,000 jobs created in June, but has been volatile throughout 2016. Also, the unemployment rate has been relatively flat at 4.9%. Now, economically, the most significant news for the quarter was the UK surprise referendum outcome to leave the European Union. We have also had a series of tragic terrorist events and an attempted coup in Turkey. There is already evidence of a slowdown in the UK economy and the IMF predicts the global GDP will follow. Sterling has dropped over 10% and central banks in Europe and the UK are all signaling an accommodated posture. Given dollar strength and slowing growth, we believe it will be more difficult for the U.S. Federal Reserve to increase rates further in the near-term. The 10-year U.S. treasury has dropped 30 basis points to 1.6% over the quarter as a result. Lower rates have fueled record highs for the S&P 500 and a surge in REIT share prices in the U.S. Given the growth in the U.S. economy, albeit anemic, office markets nationally continue to improve slowly. Net absorption was 8.4 million square feet for the second quarter. Vacancy improved 10 basis points to 13.8%. Asking rents rose 6.5% year-over-year. Construction levels are up 5% year-over-year, but remain at 2.2% of total stock, which is slightly above long-term averages. We continue to see the strongest space demand in innovation centers. So, how are we managing our business given this environment of sluggish growth, punctuated by increasingly frequent economic and political events and an uncertain Presidential election in November? First, we will continue to take advantage of reasonably healthy tenant demand and lease up our existing vacancy and new developments. Second, we will focus our new investment activity around innovation centers where we see the strongest prospects for growth. And lastly, we will also protect the downside given the prospect of volatility by requiring pre-leasing for new office developments, avoiding the purchase of stabilized assets at low cap rates and keeping our overall corporate leverage at conservative levels. Moving to private market real estate valuation, we believe prices remain strong for prime assets and gateway markets. As evidence, we have seen a number of transactions in addition to what I have discussed last quarter in our core markets that were recently committed in 2016. In Cambridge, 1 Kendall Square which is a 645,000 square foot office lab and retail asset sold for $1,124 a square foot and a low 4s initial cap rate, though the sales did include a 173,000 square foot development site. The buyer was a U.S. REIT with a capital partner. In New York, a partial interest in 7 West 34th Street, which is a 477,000 square foot office building fully let to Amazon was sold for $1,176 a square foot at a low to mid-4s cap rate to an Asian investor. In San Francisco, the peers on the Embarcadero waterfront, albeit a small 82,000 square foot building sold for a low 4s cap rate and $1,250 a square foot, which is a record for San Francisco and this was sold to a U.S. pension advisor. And in L.A, 12100 Wilshire and 11601 Wilshire sold in separate transactions to U.S. REITs possibly with non-U.S. capital partners at mid-3s cap rates in approximately $625 a square foot. As cap rates spreads widen with decreasing interest rates and risks the European investment are exacerbated by Brexit and other geopolitical events, we continue to see a tailwind for U.S. real estate valuations, particularly in our core markets. Our capital strategy remains unchanged and that we are investing primarily in new developments and redevelopments funded partially by select asset dispositions and the balance with debt financing. So, let me start with acquisitions. This quarter, we closed the purchase of a 50% interest in Colorado Center located in Santa Monica, California and that closed on July 1. Colorado Center comprises 1.2 million square feet on a 15-acre site and is one of the premier office campuses in West Los Angeles. Though the complex is very well parked with 3,100 stalls it\u2019s located one block from Bergamot Station on the newly opened commuter rail line between downtown Los Angeles and Santa Monica. Moving to economics, the property is 68% leased, which provides us with a significant upside opportunity. Our net purchase price is $504 million or $850 a square foot and renovation and tenant capital will be required to lease the property. So, the going in NOI cap rate is 3.4%, upon full lease up of the complex, we expect to achieve yields of approximately 5.5% and over 6% after a full mark-to-market of the tenant base. Teachers\u2019 owns the other 50% of Colorado Center and we will provide all leasing property and construction management for the asset. We also look forward to advancing our relationship with Teachers as part of this investment. In addition to the financial aspects of transaction, Colorado Center has provided Boston Properties with the opportunity to enter the West Los Angeles market with a significant asset. We view West LA as an important innovation center and currently one of the most vibrant office markets in the United States. Our intent is to methodically over time, build up Los Angeles into a full independent region for our company. We have hired the onsite property management staff and Ray Ritchie is providing senior-level direction to our Colorado Center in Los Angeles efforts. Property management oversight, construction development and other support are all being provided from our San Francisco office. As the Los Angeles region grows, we anticipate a migration to local personnel, both hired externally and internally transferred. Lastly, I am also pleased to report we are off to a very strong start in the leasing program for Colorado Center and Doug is going to provide more details on this. Now on dispositions, we are in the market with VA 95, our 11 building 740,000 square foot suburban office campus located in Springfield, Virginia. This park may be sold in whole or part. We are pursuing a recapitalization of Metropolitan Square, a 660,000 square foot office building located in the CBD of Washington, D.C. Given these transactions and our completed sale of 7 Kendall Center, we could reach as much as $350 million in 2016 asset sales. Moving to development, we remain active delivering assets into service, advancing our predevelopment pipeline and evaluating new investments. In terms of potential starts for 2016, we are competing for a 630,000 square foot office build-to-suit for the TSA in Springfield, Virginia. We are also commencing the full rehabilitation of the low-rise building at 601 Lexington Avenue. The building is being renamed 159 East 53rd Street and will have a segregated street entrance and lobby for our 195,000 square foot office building. We remain very active advancing our predevelopment pipeline for projects that would start after 2016. Several important updates from the second quarter include at Kendall Center in Cambridge, we are in advanced discussions with an office user to fully pre-lease a 400,000 plus square foot office building which will require demolition of an existing 80,000 square foot low-rise building. This project would not commence until 2017 and efforts continue on developing commitments and projects for the remaining approximately 500,000 square feet of potential entitlements at Kendall Center. It has been reported that Boston Properties and a local developer attempting to entitle MacArthur Station Residences, which is a 402 unit, 25 storey residential development located adjacent to the MacArthur BART Station in the Temescal neighborhood of Oakland, California. We signed a letter of intent to invest in the project and are working on the entitlement process. Given the high cost of multifamily products in the San Francisco market, we believe we can deliver high quality units at approximate a 20% discount to San Francisco rents in a location that is a 16 minute transit ride from the Embarcadero station in downtown San Francisco. The project will not commence until 2017, also subject to achieving entitlement. This past quarter, we also delivered three projects fully into service including 601 Mass Avenue in Washington, 10 CityPoint in Waltham and 804 Carnegie Center in Princeton. In the aggregate, these buildings comprise 850,000 square feet or 94% leased, cost $487 million to build and are being delivered at a 7.8% NOI return on cost, which is above our projection. Given the value of the properties is at a much lower cap rate, deliver of these projects again demonstrates the value creation power of our development platform. Now given the deliveries, at the end of the second quarter our development pipeline now consists of eight new projects and one redevelopment, representing 3.8 million square feet and $2.1 billion in projected costs. Our budgeted NOI yield for these developments is in excess of 7% and the commercial component of the pipeline is 52% pre-leased. We expect the addition of these projects to our in service portfolio to add materially to our company\u2019s growth over the next 3 years. So to conclude, we remain very enthusiastic about our prospects for success and ability to create shareholder value in the years ahead. We have a clear and achievable plan to materially grow FFO to the lease up of existing assets and the delivery of new buildings through development. We have selected non-core assets for sales to raise capital and ensure continued portfolio refreshment. We have significant entitled and un-entitled land holdings that we will continue to push through the design and permitting process and add selectively to our development pipeline in future years. Our balance sheet is strong with conservative leverage which will allow us to pursue and act on investment opportunities that present themselves in the coming quarters. So with that, let me turn it over to Doug. Doug Linde : Thanks Owen. Good morning everybody. Owen touched on the global interest rate environment and the pending election, Brexit, global political events. And if you take these things altogether, these issues elevate uncertainty and volatility and may impact capital spending decisions. In our business, a long-term lease is a major investment and requires a significant capital outlay on the part of the tenant. If you listen to any of the real estate market conditions calls or read the quarterly updates that are put out by the leasing brokerage community, I think it\u2019s pretty clear that the leasing velocity across many of our markets is feeling this impact. In addition, while the national statistics may show very little general inflation, we can tell you that very tight labor conditions in the construction industry has pushed up the price of tenant improvement work. So it\u2019s easier today to delay all these commitments and it\u2019s cheaper from a capital investment perspective to renew. So let me give you some specific of our reasons and I am going to start with San Francisco. During the first quarter, we completed a 128,000 square feet of office leasing at EC. During the second quarter, we completed over 158,000 square feet of office leasing. And as of July 1, we had more than 233,000 square feet of full floor leases under negotiation. These leases average a positive mark to market of more than 40% on a gross basis, 70% on a net basis, very consistent with the leasing spreads that were reported in our quarterly supplemental. Yet at the same time, I will tell you that the overall leasing velocity in the San Francisco CBD is well off the levels of 2014 and early 2015 and there are couple of explanations for this. First, as I described last quarter, the city at the moment is not the experiencing the unprecedented large growth from tech companies Google and Dropbox and Salesforce.com, Uber, Stripe, Slack, LinkedIn, were so active in 2014 and 2015 with significant expansions. Yet there is still growing tech demand in the first quarter, Airbnb and Twilio and Quantcast and Stripe also down blocks of about 100,000 square feet and during the second quarter Lift, Fitbit, Travana, Expedia, Reddit combined have leased over 650,000 square feet of space. And today, there are more than a dozen active requirements from technology users looking for 100,000 square feet or more including a couple that are close to 200,000 square feet Twitch, NerdWallet and Meraki are those. Second and mostly recently, high quality well built sublet space has served as the dominant large block availability. And much of the recent demand has flowed into this quadrant. Three of the four largest yields in the second quarter of over 100,000 square feet went to sublet space. Sublet availability has remained flat with the activity compensating for additional availability. Third, small space sublets are much less active, if you exclude capital raised by Uber and Snapchat during the second quarter. Overall, venture investing is pretty down significantly year-to-year. Seed in early stage investing is down from the prior year and first time, investing is also down. These are the kinds of companies that gets funded and that are putting small spaces on to the market and are also the kind of companies that would be occupants. Finally, financial services and professional services firms continued at best to be neutral demand generators. At Salesforce Tower, we continue to negotiate with the same group of transactions we were working on last quarter, plus a few additions. Most of those discussions involve tenants with late 2017 and 2018 lease expirations. The structure of the building is up to about the 40th floor and we expect to have our first tenant in occupancy in late 2017 or early 2018. We anticipate delivering the first block of space to Salesforce.com in the second quarter of \u201817 and then we have four future delivery dates that extend out into the fourth quarter of 2018. We will not recognize revenue until the tenants has completed their build out on a floor by floor basis. Even though we are going to be receiving cash rent. So at this point, we think it\u2019s prudent for modeling purposes to assume no NOI in 2017 as startup operating expenses will offset any revenue. We had an extremely active quarter in the New York City region while statistically, overall midtown market activity was a little bit light, we think it\u2019s largely because renewals have been prevalent and they are really not that typically included in the leasing activity as measured by the major brokerage firms. Our total New York regional activity in the second quarter was over 435,000 square feet and it included 320,000 square feet of renewals in expansions at 399 Park Avenue. We have now released 155,000 square feet of the 2017 City Bake Office explorations and 49,000 square feet of the 2017 Morgan Lewis explorations. The overall rent up in these spaces was about 2%, which is very consistent with my past remarks, where I said the 399 was basically a flat building. They included over 110,000 square feet of space at starting rents over $100 a square foot. This quarter across the portfolio, our New York City rollup was about 14%. Our repositioning preconstruction activities are underway at 399 and we should be under construction by the fourth quarter. On July 1, two full floor high-rise floors at the General Motors building became available. While we continue to see a consistent and steady flow of leasing volumes at between $80 and $125 a square foot, the vastly above this is a little bit slower. We have been successful leasing smaller suites across our portfolio and are going to take a similar approach to the two General Motors floors. We have shown the space and we have issued proposal to a number of tenants for portions of these floors. The most exciting news at the General Motors building is that the Under Armour has leased 53,000 square feet of the former FAO space. Their plans are being developed as we speak and we expect they will create an incredibly dynamic experience for their brand, the building and the city when they open. At the moment, we still have a temporary tenant utilizing the space and we anticipate turning the space over to Under Armour sometime in 2018. There are 17,000 square feet remaining and it will likely become part of one of the other retailing units at the building. We don\u2019t believe it\u2019s appropriate to discuss the economics of the lease, but our contribution to our $80 million revenue bridge is consistent with our prior projections. We are in deep lease negotiations with more than 55,000 square feet of the space that was subject to our lease termination last quarter at 250 West 55th. While we expect to have the lease signed in the third quarter, the space is in raw condition and we will not recognize revenue until the tenant has completed its installation, which will likely not occur until the end of \u201817 or early \u201818. All of our remaining pre-built suites are under lease negotiations and we may break one of the two remaining floors at the top of the building to create additional inventory. At the June NAREIT meetings, we have got a number of comments suggesting that the D.C. CBD office market had turned the corner again. Our view has not changed and we have not seen any demonstrable positive change in the leasing market in D.C. in the CBD. Between \u201816 and \u201819, we are tracking only one uncommitted law firm expiration over 100,000 square feet. D.C. is truly a forward leasing market for any sizable space. We are currently engaged ourselves with two law firms with 2020 explorations of over 100,000 square feet for our availabilities at that time. The GSA continues to have a very measured approach to their renewals and we are not aware of any requirements with our net demand generators. The market is now hunkering into its election inertia, which contributes the pushing out decisions. In spite of the challenging environment, we did complete 20 office leases totaling 150,000 square feet across the region. D.C. will continue to see new products come on the market either in the form of gut renovations and in some cases, ground-up developments such as Capital Crossing which is currently building 900,000 square feet of speculative product right now. This is likely to govern any significant recovery. As we enter the quarter, our Reston portfolio was 97% leased, leaving us with a smattering of small spaces. We did six small deals this quarter, with starting rents in the mid-50s. Our Town Center portfolio continues to outperform the rest of Northern Virginia. The merger of a number of government contractors with large installations in our Reston Town Center assets have created a medium term sublet space in our portfolio. While all the space is being used, these contractors are looking for cost saving opportunities and this space is their most marketable in their portfolios. With very little direct space, we are eager to work with our tenants on these potential transactions which typically require additional sub-terms. We continue to see the Boston suburban market as having the strongest relative demand growth across our portfolio. While we only completed 55,000 square feet of leases this quarter, we have more than 400,000 square feet of leases in negotiation from a series of life science, technology and even a few financial services organizations. Leasing velocity in the Waltham/Lexington submarket has accelerated during the last few months as a result of this demand and much of it is organic expansion. Last quarter, I mentioned we had over 450,000 square feet of technology and life science company used at Bay Colony. Today, we are negotiating another 100,000 square feet of life science and technology expansions or relocations at that park. It\u2019s been widely discussed that the Cambridge market continues to be one of the tightest in the country with availability rates under 5%. Virtually every major pharma company has put down a base in the Cambridge market and coupled with the growth of the biotech industry and the tech titans, there are very strong demand drivers. I will describe the active lease discussion on the first phase of our new development on the North Parcel. In addition to our development, MIT has approvals for an additional 1.3 million square feet of office and lab space and the RFP for the Volpe site has been issued and offers will be due in the coming weeks. The current zoning on the Volpe site for a nongovernmental owner allows for 1.17 million square feet of commercial space and 970,000 square feet of residential development. I mentioned a few quarters ago that Microsoft, which leases 124,000 square feet in our 255 Main Street building, had chosen to consolidate and might exercise a termination option in its lease. Well, we did in fact receive that notice and the lease will expire on December 31, 2017 allowing us the opportunity to release that space well before the original expiration date. As lease today, the weighted average rental rate on the 216,000 square feet at 255 Main Street is more than $25 a square foot below market. The Boston CBD continues to be a lease expiration driven market with a steady flow of new technology companies entering or expanding, but that\u2019s nothing like what\u2019s going on in San Francisco. We leased another mid-rise floor at 200 Clarendon. We signed our first LOI for a full floor at 120 St. James. We have a full floor lease under negotiating at 111 Huntington Avenue on a floor we are going to get back in 2017 and we are negotiating a 2.5 floor deal for Prudential Tower. 888 Boylston Street, our new office building is going to be opening in the third quarter, 71% leased with 2 or 3 floors in occupancy. The retail is going to open in December and the anchor office tenant, which is 154,000 square feet, is not planning on moving in until the fourth quarter of \u201817. So, we don\u2019t anticipate our full run-rate until the very end of \u201817 on that development. The flagship Prudential redevelopment is fully leased. We anticipate Eli will be opening in the fourth quarter of \u201816 and the final retail tenants will be opened by mid 2017. We are off to a great start in Los Angeles as Owen suggested. Colorado Center is a 6 building campus with floor space between 30,000 square feet and 62,000 square feet. It is a large user project and it fits terrifically with our operating platform design. The West LA market has had a string of strong quarters of rental rate growth as it benefits from both the creativity and entrepreneurship of local content, creators and providers and it is a growing labor market for a number of the San Francisco-based tech companies that are trying to broaden their workforce reach. In the four weeks that we have owned the property, we have signed a letter of intent with 160,000 square feet user and are in active discussion with another tenant for 60,000 square feet as well as discussions with existing tenants for expansion. If we complete simply these two leases, we will have leased 63% of the available space. We have also hired a set of design professionals and consultants that are assisting us with our future repositioning plan. Let me end my comments with a further update on our revenue bridge. With the additional leasing at Embarcadero Center and at the General Motors building, we have now pushed our completed transactions to over $58 million of the $80 million that we anticipated to receive by the end of 2017. And with that, I will turn the floor over to Mike. Mike LaBelle : Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning. I just want to start with a quick summary of where we see the debt markets today. We do have some refinancing opportunities coming up and the debt markets have been open and improving in the face of the recent volatility in the rates market and the uncertainty in the global recovery after Brexit. We have two mortgages that are maturing in the next 8 months. One is the $350 million mortgage on Embarcadero Center floor. It has a 7% GAAP interest rate that expires on December 1. And the second is the $750 million mortgage on 599 Lexington Avenue with a 5.4% GAAP interest rate that expires on March 1, 2017. Both of these loans have an open window and we can pay them off with no penalty commencing this September and refinance at significantly lower interest expense. We also used $500 million of our cash balances to fund the acquisition of Colorado Center in July, bringing our available cash down to approximately $700 million after quarter end. With $1.3 billion remaining to fund in our development pipeline over the next couple of years, we may also look to enhance our liquidity with additional financing. Overall, our balance sheet remains conservatively leveraged and we have substantial capacity to add debt to fund new investments. Our leverage is expected to improve as we achieve the significant earnings contributions projected from our development as we move into late 2017 and 2018. Additionally, last week, Moody\u2019s announced the positive outlook on our unsecured debt ratings. The bond market has performed well through the recent volatility and our credit spreads have tightened. Even with the most recent slight run up in long-term rates, we believe that we can borrow for 10 years in the unsecured bond market at around 3%. We also have access to the secured debt markets where comparable borrowing costs are in the low to mid-3% range for high quality properties that have reasonable leverage. You should also recall that we have entered into hedges for a notional amount of $550 million, targeting financing in the second half of 2016 at the 10-year swap rate of 2.42%. So at today\u2019s interest rates, we would have to amortize approximately 100 basis points of hedging costs into our interest expense on the first $550 million of financing. Although we are evaluating the markets as we always are, we have not assumed any early financing activity in our earnings guidance. Turning to our earnings results for the quarter, you can see from her press release that we reported second quarter FFO of $1.43 per share, that is $0.06 per share or about $10 million higher than the midpoint of our guidance range. The biggest factor and are exceeding our guidance was termination income that was approximately $6 million or $0.04 per share higher than our projection. All of this income was in our guidance for later in 2016, so it represents an acceleration of the timing of income recognition into the second quarter, but has no impact on our full year projection. The largest piece was related to 100,000 square foot space at 399 Park Avenue that had a natural lease expiration in late 2017. We were able to sign a replacement lease for this space with the client seeking to occupy earlier and this in conjunction with the other leases that Doug mentioned represents 200,000 square feet of forward leasing which is a great start in covering our late 2017 exposure at 399 Park. The performance of our portfolio drove approximately $4 million or $0.02 per share of the out-performance this quarter. Revenue was slightly ahead of expectations, while expenses, primarily utilities and repair and maintenance expense, were lower by about $3 million. Over $2 million of the expense reduction is related to R&M projects that have been reforecast into the back half of the year. So this portion will not flow through to our full year guidance. Our same-property performance moderated this quarter, but it was still strong with our share of combined cash NOI of 4.7% and combined GAAP NOI of 0.7% from the same quarter last year. The most significant impact affecting this quarter was 140,000 square feet of space at 601 Lexington Avenue that expired midway through the quarter. As we discussed last quarter, we anticipate our same property NOI growth to continue to moderate for the rest of 2016. We will have downtime between leases for the 80,000 square feet of high-rise space at 760 75th Avenue that Doug talked about. We also have 160,000 square feet expiring this quarter at 191 Spring Street which is in suburban Boston from a client who relocated and expanded at 10 CityPoint. We are working on a proposal for the majority of this space, but there will likely be 12 months to 18 months of downtime between leases. On the positive side, we are and expect to continue to see growth from lease-up and roll-up of rents at Embarcadero Center, Prudential Center and 200 Clarendon Street. Overall, the leasing activity we are seeing is in line with our expectations and we assume our share of same-property combined NOI in 2016 will be up between 0.25% and 1.75% on a GAAP basis and between 2% and 4% on a cash basis over 2015. In our non same-property portfolio, we acquired Colorado Center this quarter and it is projected to add approximately $0.05 per share to our 2016 FFO. Based upon its addition, we are increasing our guidance for the incremental contribution from the non same-property portfolio to $46 million to $52 million over 2015. Colorado Center also has an impact on our non-cash rents as there are several leases that are in free rent periods for the remainder of 2016. We received a credit from the seller equal to the amount of free rent, but the accounting rules require this to be reflected as a reduction in the purchase price as opposed to rental income, which is part of the reason why the net purchase price came down to $504 million. We now project our non-cash rents in 2016 to be $52 million to $65 million. As you think about the change in our full year guidance, remember that we had included within our prior guidance virtually all of the second quarter earnings fee. We just expected it to occur later in the year. So the impact of the remaining changes results in our increasing our guidance range for 2016 funds from operation to $5.92 to $5.99 per share. This is an increase of $0.06 per share at the midpoint, consisting of $0.05 per share from the acquisition of Colorado Center and $0.01 per share of better projected portfolio performance. I just want to close by adding some comments about 2017, although we will not be providing formal guidance until next quarter. First and just a reminder, that in 2016, we have recorded $57 million in termination income which is much higher than typical and is primarily due to the large termination at 250 West 55th Street the last quarter. This represents $0.34 per share of 2016 earnings that we do not expect to recur at the same level in 2017. Second as Doug described in a development pipeline, more than half of the leasing at 888 Boylston Street and all of the pre-leasing at Salesforce Tower will not commence GAAP revenue until late in \u201817 and into \u201818. The space is leased and the revenue commitment is in line with our previous projection that we outlined in our investor presentation as recently as June that show the projected quarterly development run rate accelerating as we move into 2018. Also, we have captured a good portion of the $80 million in NOI growth that we have been projecting and we will see the impact in our revenues, particularly at the Prudential Center and Embarcadero Center next year. As Doug described, the majority of the projected revenue from the lease up of other properties such as 760 75th Avenue, 601 Lex, 200 Clarendon Street and 120 St. James will likely hit by 2018. That completes all of our formal remarks. Operator, if you could open up the line for questions that will be great. Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi. Michael Bilerman : Hey, good morning. It\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Manny. Question, Owen or Doug, as you think about your stated strategy and one of the components is to being astute investors and looking at market timing for investment decisions by acquiring properties in times of opportunity, I take it sort of view Colorado Center as part of LA. but I am curious if you think about what\u2019s going on in UK, certainly what\u2019s going up in Canada, you go to Toronto and London in the past, the U.S. currency is certainly a lot more stronger today and one could argue that those are the opportune times to get into the market, so how should investors \u2013 how should we think about how you are thinking about it today and whether that could be something that\u2019s on the table? Owen Thomas : Yes. So Michael the \u2013 we have as you know targeted a handful of markets for potential expansion of the company, one of those was LA. We obviously made a significant move on that piece of the strategy last quarter and also London has been on our list. And our view of London is that it will continue to be a great world city and will be an interesting market for real estate investment and development. So that hasn\u2019t changed. However, in the short-term and medium-term, given the Brexit vote, there are more uncertainties about economic growth and space demand. We don\u2019t know the impacts on trade policy, what that\u2019s going to do to GDP growth. We don\u2019t know the impacts on passporting for financial institutions, what impact that will have on jobs in London. And so as we think about London, there has already been a 10% drop in the pound, which is helpful as the dollar investor, but we also think pricing for assets should also change given these uncertainties that I described. So, we are still looking, we are still active, but we are conscious of these additional risks and would expect those to be reflected in pricing. And then lastly, we are not particularly active looking at Toronto. Michael Bilerman : Hey, guys, Manny here. If we just think about the comments you made on Colorado Center with a good backlog of leasing that\u2019s going to come in. Is there going to be an outsized capital commitment needed to get those tenants into that project or is that going to come with sort of the second phase of re-planning the project overall? Owen Thomas : Manny, I think we have made a commitment to our tenants and we have I think had these conversations with our partners that the buildings, common areas need to be refreshed in a more significant way than simply painting carpet and so we have hired a series of design professionals that are going through a programmatic view of all of that right now which we are going to do one way or the other regardless of the leasing. And I think that those commitments are being described to the tenants as they talk about coming to the property. Michael Bilerman : And Doug, maybe one last one for me, if we think about leasing at 399 and GM, you mentioned smaller spaces at GM, was that sort of your plan all along or has there been a shift in the market or demand profile of tenants that\u2019s now making you sort of rethink strategy to get those spaces of lease? Doug Linde : I don\u2019t think our strategy has changed significantly. I mean, I have talked about this before that if you go back, call it, 4 to 5 years and you look at the number of relocations that involve tenants that are paying over $125,000 a square foot, you can probably count them on one hand. And so the market naturally is one that is a smaller market meaning a floor at a max and generally less than that. And so having grown through the experience of 510 Madison Avenue plus the top of 250 West 55th Street, I think we have become pretty acute and adept at doing the right kind of pre-built suite in marketing those types of spaces to the appropriate kinds of tenants and we recognized that it\u2019s a velocity game and we have got to increase velocity. And the best way to increase velocity is to be much more attuned to doing smaller deals. Michael Bilerman : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Jamie Feldman : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Mike, I appreciate the comments on 2017 as we are building out our models. You talked about moderating same-store NOI heading into the end of the year. Based on the leasing you guys have done, when do you see the inflection point for same-store to turn positive or kind of start growing again? Mike LaBelle : Well, I think we expect it to be positive, right. I mean, it\u2019s we are saying it\u2019s going to be 2% to 4% in 2016. So, it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s been higher than that in the first two quarters. So, it\u2019s just going to come down a little bit, because we have got some of the vacancies that we talked about. But as we have seen our leasing stats, for many quarters in a row, we are having a positive mark-to-market on everything that we do. And I do anticipate that our occupancy is going to turn the corner in 2017 as well as we filled some of the vacancies at 120 St. James in the Hancock and the Peru. So, I don\u2019t have a number to give you right now, but I would expect positive performance in 2017 on the same-store. Jamie Feldman : Yes, I guess I am sorry, I shouldn\u2019t have said positive, I meant accelerating. So, do you think \u201817 same-store is on track to be better than \u201816? Mike LaBelle : Again, I don\u2019t want to tell you where it\u2019s going to be, to be honest with you, Jamie, I just think it\u2019s going to continue to be positive. There is a lot of space that we can fill that it\u2019s going to add to us over the next, I would say, 24 months. The question is the timing of when some of those spaces gets filled and when the revenue recognition associated with those spaces are and whether that is in \u201817 or pushing into \u201818. So, there is a little bit of a timing game but these are all really, really high-quality spaces and I think we are proving that we are getting all the rollups through the leasing that we are doing. So, I feel very optimistic and positive about our ability to continue to grow our same-store and achieve the NOI bridge that we have been talking about. Jamie Feldman : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then as we think about AFFO for the year, how are you guys tracking now? Doug Linde : So, on the FAD side, I would say that our guidance for 2016 is still somewhere in the low $4 range, I think $4 to $4.20 something like that per share. We did have a little bit of elevated transaction cost this quarter associated with some long-term leases that we did both in Washington and New York City. There were two in particular that were longer term and had some higher transaction costs associated with it that kind of hit our FAD a little bit this quarter, but we still expect to be generally where we were when we talked about this last quarter. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then any early thoughts on the train shutdown heading to Brooklyn and what it means for your project out there longer term for leasing? Doug Linde : I will make a quick comment and then John Powers you can comment on this too. The good news for us is that we don\u2019t anticipate delivering our space until the second or third quarter of 2018. And from what we are told, the L train is going to be out of service for 18 months, which would line it backup for when in fact we deliver, but John, I don\u2019t know if you have any other thoughts? John Powers : Yes, the L train \u2013 it\u2019s unfortunate for the Brooklyn residents, but not unfortunate for our project, because that goes into Williamsburg and we are south of that. So, the lines that the subway takers would use to get to our project, Dock 72 will not be affected. Jamie Feldman : Okay, alright, great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Blaine Heck : Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just the follow-up for Mike on same-store NOI just looking at the trend, your cash same-store NOI guidance and your share 2% to 4%, if my math is right, it looks like you will have to average around 0% for the rest of the year to get to the midpoint. So, is it just that you are looking for significant same-store occupancy drag for the rest of the year or is there something with straight line rent, because it seems like rent spreads and rent ramps are pretty strong, so was there something else I am missing? Mike LaBelle : Look, I think the biggest drivers are New York City where we have the two floors at the General Motors building coming back in July. We had the four floors at 601 Lexington Avenue that came back midway through the second quarter. And then we have this space in suburban Boston that I mentioned in my formal remarks that it\u2019s coming back. And so you are going to see some degradation in occupancy in the third quarter. And I think we make \u2013 hopefully, we will see some come back in the fourth quarter and late in the fourth quarter, but those are the things that are driving our share of the same-store being, I would say, 0% to 1% probably in the next couple of quarters. Blaine Heck : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe for Doug or Ray Ritchey, it sounds like you guys are off to a great start with the leasing at Colorado Center, but can you talk a little bit about the amount of interest you are seeing in the balance of the vacant space and whether the peso leasing has surprised you guys or were any of the leases that anticipated kind of when you bought the asset? Doug Linde : So when we started the diligence on the asset after we reached our agreement with Blackstone to purchase their interest, there were a few tenants that were \u201cshopping the property\u201d but had no real sense of who the ownership was going to be. And so I think there was a lack of concrete proposals. Ray has done a fabulous job of walking the walk and talking the talk and being out there. He is actually there right now, which is why he is not on this call and he has been very proactive about meeting every tenant that we have made a proposal to, which I think is a different approach than the current \u2013 the former ownership had with regards to leasing. And so I think we have turned the lot of heads in terms of the way we were managing this asset. And quite frankly, as I said before, these kinds of buildings and these kinds of clients match up with the way we run our platform. And so we are used to and anticipate doing these types of things when we buy a property or when we are developing a property. So, I think \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say we are surprised by the level of activity. We are very encouraged by the receptivity that the activity has had to our approach and the way we are pricing the property and the way we are committed to enhancing the environment and the experience for our tenants and our customers, because that\u2019s what this is all about. Blaine Heck : So, what\u2019s the kind of reasonable timeframe for expecting that asset to be leased up to a stabilized level? Doug Linde : So the underwriting that Owen was describing assume that we weren\u2019t going to do any leasing for 18 months. Obviously, we are going to be doing a lot more leasing than that. And so, I would anticipate that we will get these first couple of leases done some time in 2016. Again, when the tenants actually occupy the space and revenue recognition occurs is a little bit out of our control, but we are hoping that we are going to be in the 90s by the middle of 2017, which is 12 months after we bought the property. Blaine Heck : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : The next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO. John Kim : Thank you. I think Owen you mentioned methodically building your presence in LA, but your balance sheet position allows you to acquire almost anything accretively and you have had some good leasing progress so far, so why not acquire more rapidly in the market? Owen Thomas : Well, our approach is to create value and not to buy assets that are stabilized at low cap rates. So most of the investment that we have been making is \u2013 has been in ground up development as you know. I described three projects that we delivered this quarter at 7.8% cash yield for a brand new asset, again in our core markets which we think is very value creative. So we are looking at everything that\u2019s offered in West LA. We are looking at development opportunities are not as many, given the restrictions that are on development in West LA which is one of the attraction, honestly of the market. So we are looking at that. And I think would also certainly be much more interested in assets like Colorado Center that are very high quality, but they had something that needs to be done. So when we bought Colorado Center, it was 68% leased and there was an upside opportunity in our minds from leasing it up which I think as Doug described, we are very much on track in doing. So yes, we could go out and pay, purchase the pipeline of assets that continue to be offered in the marketplace, but we want to be selective about getting a high quality asset, giving an asset that is positioned for our type of tenants which are generally larger and also we would prefer an acquisition where there is something that we can do to add value as a property company. John Kim : Okay. And Doug I think you mentioned that you have achieved $50 million of the $80 million organic growth forecasted through 2017, given that progress so far, is there an upside to this organic growth number? Doug Linde : So, what we are talking about is the bridge. So, what we basically said was here are all the major holds in the portfolio in \u201816 and \u201817 and if we sell them all up, we will get to $80 million. So, I think the number is a consistent number and its $58 million, not $50 million. John Kim : Okay. Can you provide some color on the Under Armour space, the remaining 17,000 square feet available, where is that located within the Former FAO Schwarz space. And if you could just comment generally on experience based retail and there are any other opportunities in your portfolio where you have leasing opportunities like this? Doug Linde : Sure. John, do you want to take a crack at describing sort of the space and how the FAO space was configured and what\u2019s going to happen? John Powers : Sure. The FAO spaces are on four different floors and we are re-leased, as Doug said, majority of the space. The balance of the space is not on the main floor and there are some different possibilities of how we can continue that and we have worked out that with Under Armour. Doug Linde : And with regard to the experience of retail, I think it\u2019s a critically important component of what we are doing and Bryan, you might wanted to describe what we are doing at Prudential Center and our decision for example to bring Italy [ph] into that property and why we are doing that? Bryan Koop : Yes. Several years ago, we came to a conclusion that in order to be relevant in terms of retail formats, which is so important to our mixed use projects, we had to have a large component of experience for retail. Our major decision was the decision to shutdown our traditional food court, which was a high performing food court, one of the highest grossing in North America and repositioning with Italy that will open up this November. We continue to see strong demand, not only in these mixed use high density projects but the urban markets are incredibly high in demand and we consistently see it whether it\u2019s a Prudential Center where we have very few spaces remaining in terms of our repositioning of the entire asset, but we are also seeing it in our limited amount of retail, we had in Cambridge and then also the significant amount we have pre-leased at our Hub project at North Station with our partners, with Jacobs, at Delaware North. And I think both those projects are indicative of that. You will also see it just in terms of the urban storefront in our downtown assets as well. Doug Linde : And just to sort of keep going, so we are doing a similar project at 100 Federal Street where we are building basically a glass experiential box that we hope is the gathering place for the downtown market. And John, you may want to describe what we are doing at 601? John Powers : Well, 601 is a very exciting redevelopment. Doug mentioned \u2013 or I think Owen mentioned initially, the smaller building which used to cover atrium building, we are re-branding that completely. We are taking skin off the building. We are taking all the mechanical systems. It will be essentially down to a slab and steel structure and rebuilding it from scratch up. So that\u2019s going to be very well received in the market. That\u2019s almost 200,000 square feet. We are also looking at that the atrium and have plans to make that into a spectacular food hall and that will be just a little later and it\u2019s timing relative to the office building. John Kim : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Vincent Chao : Yes. Hi guys, sorry about that. Just a question on the development side of things and some of the commentary around protecting the downside, pre-leasing has been a part of the strategy for a while but I was just curious if the continued sort of slowness in the economy has raised the bar in terms of what you would require from a pre-leasing perspective relative to maybe a year ago or so, I just also \u2013 just a question on just leasing activity you are seeing at Dock 72? Owen Thomas : So to answer your question and I have talked about this over the last couple of calls. Yes, I think given the slowness in the economy, we have raised the bar, so to speak in the level of pre-leasing that we require on new development. It\u2019s everyone always asks for a number of this and that\u2019s not possible to provide, because it depends on the size of the building, the activity level in the market, the speed of delivery, every circumstance is different, where is the tenant coming from, our existing portfolio from outside. But there is no question \u2013 as we evaluate new developments and we have a lot to evaluate even in our company because of the large land holdings that we have, pre-leasing is an absolute requirement and our desire to have it be larger in the portfolio is there. So that is definitely happening. However, I think we still see projects and I have described a couple of them, particularly several of the projects that we are looking at right now are actually 100% pre-leased. And those are the kinds of projects that we want to be doing and will create value for shareholders even if we are layer in the economic cycle. As it relates to Dock 72 leasing, we are just too far away from delivery to expect much significant pre-letting. We are clearly in the market speaking with potential tenants marketing the asset, but I think it\u2019s too early to expect \u2013 for us to expect to have significant pre-letting. Vincent Chao : Okay. And just with regard to WeWork, I guess they have been in the news lately not necessarily for great reasons, but I am just curious, I mean there is no \u2013 I guess there are no discussions with them potentially re-trading that or\u2026? Doug Linde : No, we are full systems go with WeWork at the Brooklyn Navy Yard and at the other two properties where we have leases. Let me comment that as we have, in our discussions with WeWork, all evidence that we have points to the fact that the facilities that they have opened are very successful. They are fully let and they are creating attractive margin to WeWork. And we are seeing it in the projects where they are opened with us, particularly 535 Mission has been very successful. So a lot of the press that you are describing is more about WeWork as a company. And again from reading the same press, a reduction in the projections that they are projecting for their overall company, but as it relates to the performance of the individual installations we are evidence I think suggest that they are doing well. John Powers : And this is John, if I could just like to add one comment. We are very actively engaged with them at the Navy Yard. We are driving piles it was Owen said it\u2019s early on. It will be more exciting in the fall when this deal goes up, but we are in weekly communications with WeWork. They have submitted their build out plans. We are adjusting the build out plans. We are co-working with them on the amenity space. They are very, very excited about the project. Vincent Chao : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman of KeyBanc Capital Management. Craig Mailman : So, follow-up on FAO space, I think Doug, you said that the lease with Under Armour represents what you guys thought it was $80 million? I am just curious when you guys kind of underwrote the backfill the FAO space, does Under Armour just by itself represent the backfill, then the 17,000, it includes pro forma, the balance will lease up? Doug Linde : I think the answer is yes to both. So, I am not being sort of tongue and cheek about it. We are comfortable with the rent that we pro forma for Under Armour and based upon what\u2019s available we think we will do a little bit better. Craig Mailman : Okay. And then I thought that space was 60,000 square feet, it looks like it\u2019s closer to 70,000, was FAO just not leasing all the leasable space you guys creating the low rate space? Doug Linde : No, there was 68,000 square feet of space. Some of it might have been as John suggested it was on four levels. So, there was second floor space. There were sort of two-storey, two-storeys of first floor space, because that\u2019s the level on Madison Avenue and the level on Fifth Avenue are on slightly different planes and then there was some sub-grade space or concord space and sub-concord space. So, there is a plethora of levels there and it was about 58,000 square feet. John Powers : And those levels can connect differently. We could put the second floor level connected to the Madison. We can take part of the sub-concourse and put it with the bank. If the bank doesn\u2019t stay that\u2019s on Madison, because it\u2019s fairly complicated, but we have worked it out, I think with Under Armour. They are committed to block a space of square footage that Doug mentioned. Craig Mailman : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just switching to the debt side of things, Mike, your comments were helpful. I am just curious, it sounds like you guys don\u2019t necessarily think rates are going higher that quickly here. As you look to fund the remaining development spend, are you more apt to put construction facilities in place or kind of hit the unsecured market and sit on the cash? Mike LaBelle : No, I think that we will do some construction financing on some of the joint venture development projects that we have. So, we are in the market for both the Brooklyn Navy Yard and for the Hub on Causeway. So, we will be leasing construction financings on those projects. For the remaining cost for the wholly owned developments, I would expect that we would use cash on hand. And then at some point, we would do some long-term financing rates that we feel are very, very attractive to kind of lock in and make sure that we lock in as low rate as we can. So, we will be evaluating that. John Powers : And just as a surrogate, right? So, a construction loan space probably LIBOR plus 200 at the lowest level and 300 and you can do a 10-year financing at 3%. So, the value of a construction loan from a rate perspective is de minimis. Doug Linde : That\u2019s an excellent point. Craig Mailman : Thank you. Doug Linde : You are welcome. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors. Jed Reagan : On the Oakland department development, there have been some concerns about softening conditions in the Bay Area residential marketing. Just curious how you are thinking about the risk from slowing job growth in new supply in the metro area there as you move forward on the project? Doug Linde : Sure. Bob, you want to take that one? Bob Pester : Sure. First off, we are underwriting at rents that are approximately 25% to 30% less than San Francisco. It\u2019s going to take several years to get it entitled and we don\u2019t anticipate delivering that building until probably 2019, 2020. So, we are quite ways off based on current market conditions from a standpoint as the market is softening right now which we are seeing in San Francisco. Doug Linde : And Bob, you might just want to describe sort of the Temescal area and the Rockridge area and sort of what that is, because it\u2019s not downtown Oakland? Bob Pester : It\u2019s \u2013 this site is right adjacent to the MacArthur BART station. This is an area that has become very popular for restaurant shops. It\u2019s one of for lack of a better term, one of the hipper neighborhoods in the Oakland Berkeley market and it\u2019s one that is gentrifying quite rapidly. So, we see it as a very good location long-term. Jed Reagan : Okay, that\u2019s hopeful. And just sticking on the Bay Area, on Salesforce Tower, you had mentioned earlier this year that you thought you might get 5 to 15 new floors on this year. I think it was based on what you have done so far this year, how much additional space do you think you could get committed by the end of this year and then maybe by this time next year? Doug Linde : So, look the deals that we have in the works right now add up to about 8 floors? So, if we are able to do half of them, we probably will get 5 or 6 of those floors done. And I think that our expectation is that we are going to continue to go with that type of a pace so that as we get closer to people actually being able to go into the building and go to their floor and to sort of experience the spectacular configuration views, curtain wall, airflow, ceiling height that, that will ramp up the activity and we anticipate that will be happening towards the end of this calendar year where we have to actually do those tours on finished floors. And so, I will let Bob be the spokesperson, because he has already made a commitment for the company, but we continue to be very encouraged by the leasing there. Bob? Bob Pester : I think Donald Trump would refer to the building as something really, really special. It\u2019s the A1 location in San Francisco. It\u2019s going to be the biggest and the best building that\u2019s in the marketplace and I am very confident that it\u2019s going to lease up rapidly. Jed Reagan : Okay, thank you. And then just last one for me. Can you talk about the tempo of leasing demand you are seeing across your portfolio between larger tenants versus smaller tenants? Would you say it\u2019s fair to say that larger tenants are more cautious today? Doug Linde : I think that larger tenants are not necessarily more cautious. I think the larger tenants are fully committed to lease exploration driven decisions that allow them to build out space. So, anybody who is looking for hundreds of thousands of square feet of space is doing that, because across the broad markets that we are in, because they have a lease expiration and I don\u2019t think anyone is looking at the market and saying, well, we think things are going to get worse and therefore we are going to hold off. I think there people feel relatively good about sort of the position that the markets are in. On the smaller side where there is a lot more flexibility, I think the volatility that Owen described and issues associated with the world at large are creating uncertainty and uncertainty just doesn\u2019t drive significant capital decisions and so we are seeing a lot more reticence to making decisions on new space for smaller companies. Jed Reagan : Okay, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Brad Burke with Goldman Sachs. Brad Burke : Hey, good morning guys. Just a question on the guidance, what you have done so far for the year and then the midpoint of guidance for the third quarter of 141, it looks like it would imply about 149 for the fourth quarter, so just wanted to understand anything we are going to be thinking about that would drive that sequential improvement from Q3, Q4? Owen Thomas : I think there is really three things that we have. One is developments that are occurring and leasing up, which is part of that. We will have a couple of tenants at 888 that will take occupancy later this year that have a benefit to the company. Also interest expense, we talked about the fact that we don\u2019t have any early refinancing in our guidance, but we do have the Embarcadero Center and it\u2019s a 7% loan. So, there is an assumption on our guidance. So, there is going to be much lower interest expense when we refinance that in the fourth quarter. The other thing I would mention would be operating expenses which are cyclically highest in the third quarter and lower in the fourth quarter primarily due to utilities, where the HVAC is obviously a little more expensive in the harder times of the year that we are sitting in right now, actually. So, those are kind of the most of the drivers and there is some positives that we talked about in terms of leasing activity later in the year that we are guiding later in the year things like continued activity at Embarcadero Center where we have got renewals that we are working on that we are trying to sign that we have kind of a blend and extend where we will get some GAAP lift later in the year. So it\u2019s those kinds of thing. Brad Burke : Okay. And then also related to guidance, of the $58 million of the $80 million NOI bridge, just wondering how much of that is already being recognized as GAAP NOI and to the extent that you are not recognizing any of it yet when you would expect that to roll on in your numbers? Owen Thomas : We have provided some information as to the timing of that. I can\u2019t give you exact numbers. I would say that somewhere between $15 million and $20 million is in today, because that was if you look at our slide, there was 535 Mission and existing rent lease up within in that and that is done. A good chunk of, I would say, half of the Embarcadero Center stuff will be in late this year and next year. And then the Prudential Center stuff would be in next year, but not this year. And then there are some big pieces that I think will be later. We are going to get some of the lease up at 200 Clarendon Street and perhaps a floor at 120 St. James that will hit sometime in \u201817, the majority of that I see has been later because that is \u2013 most of that space is we have to wait until the tenant occupies to recognize revenue on that space. And then we have talked about Under Armour and the timing of that. And then, 100 Federal Street which is another big piece of it, the lease is fully signed. But right now we are relocating another tenant to create the floors. We are not going to be able to deliver those floors until sometime in the middle of \u201817. So some of that will be into \u201817 and then into \u201818. So I didn\u2019t give you the numbers, but that\u2019s hopefully helpful with some guidance on the timing. Brad Burke : Got it, that is helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick with Capital One Securities. Tom Lesnick : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I will be brief since we are going late in the call here. But quickly on Boston, we have seen pretty strong job growth here over the last quarter especially relative to some of your other markets and I think you mentioned in your earlier remarks about the strength of pharma and biotech right now, but I am just wondering are you seeing that wholesale across the entire region or are you seeing any sort of bifurcation between suburban and infill? Doug Linde : So most as of the technology oriented companies in the biotech and the pharma and life sciences companies are concentrated in the Cambridge market and then in the suburban markets, so there has been some migration into the city. So I would tell you that on a sort of ranking, Cambridge is the strongest market, the Waltham, Lexington market is the second strongest and then the CBD downtown markets are below that. And I think what our view is that the markets are very strong at the sort of lower level of buildings, but that there is a little less activity at the top of building and largely that\u2019s because the tenants that are driving demand. The top of the buildings traditionally are professional services and financial services companies and there is just less growth there. John Powers : We have seen it and then really a beautiful stat, the P2 corridor as we call it between the Mass Turnpike and Route 2 at Lexington sites of the north along Interstate 95, the competitive set of buildings that we follow, 32 buildings are now at 4.25% vacancy, it\u2019s lowest I have seen in my career there. And I think it\u2019s indicative of your question, which was you have good strong demand from pharma, biotech sector that\u2019s looking and as Doug mentioned, solid company is not particularly huge companies, but companies that have growth in financial statements, so we were encouraged about that corridor in particular. Tom Lesnick : Appreciate that insight. And then Bob, maybe one for you, there has been some recent news reports of Facebook pursuing a significant office expansion in the San Francisco proper, are you able to comment at all on what kind of chatter you are hearing among the brokerage community and if at all, it has this changed leasing dynamics, particularly in Central SoMa? Owen Thomas : Yes. It\u2019s very preliminary as far as them looking into market. It\u2019s been rumored that they are interested in the Central SoMa area. The Central SoMa plan is not approved and won\u2019t be approved probably until the end of this year or early next year. So I think as far as them expanding in San Francisco unless they get an existing building is going to be quite sometime off. Tom Lesnick : Great. I appreciate that. That\u2019s all we got. Thanks. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel. John Guinee : Okay, great. Hey, I am not sure this is for, but it looks like your earnings per share is over $3 this year, it looks like it\u2019s going to increase fairly rapidly next year, you have got a dividend of 2.60, sub-2%, it looks like you will have some gains on sales, you may or may not be able to 1031 exchange that into Colorado Center, but the long and the short of it is your sub-2% dividend may be holding back your stock price, you may have some taxable income issues, can you talk about both the regular dividend and the special dividend? Doug Linde : Yes. Good morning, John. So on the special dividend, as you know, that\u2019s driven by asset sales. I described three deals that we are working on. There are a couple of other little smaller things. And I said in my remarks that sales could be as high as $350 million. I would assume that\u2019s the highest they would be. All those deals may not happen. We don\u2019t know where they are priced. The original direction on asset sales was to 2 to 2.50. So we don\u2019t know yet exactly what the asset sales are going to be. So it\u2019s difficult for us to predict what the gains and so forth are going to be associated with that. So we are clearly \u2013 look at that and working with our Board later in the year to determine what if any special dividend, we would pay. And then as it relates to the recurring dividend, as you know, we mirror that to net income and as you pointed out, net income will be rising. So again, with our Board as we get into later this year, we will be evaluating the ongoing dividend to determine whether and how much we could increase it. John Guinee : Any idea Mike, what\u2019s your \u2013 and if your earnings per share is $3 or more, what your taxable income is for 2016? Mike LaBelle : I don\u2019t have a number for you here. And I think that I can say that our taxable income is fairly close in line with where dividend is. John Guinee : Great, okay. Thanks a lot, gentlemen. Owen Thomas : John, thank you. I think that concludes our questions and concludes our formal remarks. Thank you for your time and attention and interest in Boston Properties. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s Boston Properties conference call. Thank you again for attending and have a good day.",

During the question-and-answer portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, Senior Executive Vice President and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks. Owen Thomas : Thank you, Arista. Good morning, everyone. As usual, I\u2019ll cover our quarterly results, market conditions, as well as our current capital strategy and investment activity. On current results, we produced another solid quarter with FFO per share a $0.01 above our prior guidance, primarily due to portfolio outperformance. We also increased our full-year 2016 FFO per share projection by $0.03. For the quarter, we leased just under 900,000 square feet, which is below our historical averages. However, we have a very robust pipeline of in-service and development leasing activity, which we think will be signed before calendar year end and which will bring our annual leasing for 2016 in line with or possibly above averages. Our in-service portfolio occupancy is now 89.6%, which is down 120 basis points from the end of the second quarter, and this is due primarily to the addition of Colorado Center to the portfolio. We have another quarter of positive rent rollups in our leasing activity with rental rates on leases that commenced in the third quarter up 6% on a gross basis and 8% on a net basis compared to prior lease. Now moving to the economy, U.S. economic growth continues to be positive, but as we all know, it\u2019s been sluggish. Second quarter GDP growth has been revised up to 1.4%. It was 0.8% in the first quarter, an estimate for all of 2016 are 2% or less. The employment picture continues to improve gradually with 156,000 jobs created in September and the unemployment rate has remained flat at 5%. Wages have perked up a bit up 2.6%, though inflation remains low at 1.1% for the third quarter. Moving to capital markets, the ten-year U.S. Treasury has risen approximately 40 basis points to 1.25% from lows in July, which has sparked a seemingly harsh REIT market correction of 5.5%-plus over the past month. Though the Fed is signaling one rate hikes for year end, further increases in the short to medium-term, we think will be tempered by low interest rates in the developed world dollar strength, sluggish growth in the U.S., and low inflation. Given the growth in U.S. economy, office markets nationally continue to improve albeit more slowly. Net absorption was 8.7 million feet for the third quarter and the vacancy rate was flat to last quarter, but improved 30 basis points from a year ago. Asking rents rose nearly 6% year-over-year and construction levels are up 6% year-over-year, and our 2.3% of total stock, which is above the long-term average of 1.9% for the U.S. office market. Moving to private real estate capital markets, we believe interest from primarily non-U.S. investors remains healthy for prime assets in gateway markets. However, transaction volumes are below 2015 levels and domestic institutional investors have been less of a factor in this segment of the market. Commodity assets are more difficult to sell and there are fewer bidders for Class A trophy. There are, however, several examples of Class A assets continuing to sell for favorable prices in the third quarter. In Cambridge, 245 First Street, which is a 300,000 square foot office and lab building sold to a domestic pension fund advisor for a $1,020 per square foot in the mid-4%s cap rate. In San Francisco, a sovereign wealth fund purchased a minority position in 100 First Street and 303 Second Street for approximately $950 a square foot, which is a low 4%s cap rate. And finally, in West LA, 233 Wilshire was acquired by U.S. REIT in partnership with a sovereign wealth fund for a $1,080 per square foot, and a low to mid-4%s cap rate, and there\u2019s a pipeline of additional deals in the West LA market we think with similar pricing metrics. We believe the relative stability of the U.S. market even Brexit and other global turbulence, as well as the fact that U.S. cap rate spreads to treasuries remain above the long-term averages will provide a cushion for U.S. real estate valuations, particularly in our core markets. So in summary, operating performance improvement in office remains positive, but is later in the cycle and slowing slightly. Interest rates are up modestly. So it will likely remain low and private capital flows into our space remain healthy, but somewhat diminished from previous quarters. Given this economic picture, we will continue to take advantage of a reasonably healthy tenets demand and lease up our existing vacancy and new development. We\u2019ll focus our new investment activity on new development and asset refurbishment in the innovation centers, where we see the strongest prospects for growth. We will also protect the downside by requiring preleasing for new office developments, avoiding the purchase of stabilized assets at low cap rates, selectively selling assets, and keeping our overall corporate leverage at conservative levels. Moving to the execution of our capital strategy, as you know, we completed the acquisition of Colorado Center in West LA last quarter. We\u2019ve had a very \u2013 we\u2019ve had very strong leasing activity of the project and are completing our redevelopment plan. We are also actively seeking to grow West LA into another major region for Boston Properties over the long-term and are reviewing a number of on and off-market opportunities. However, we will remain disciplined and patient and focus only on investments that create attractive returns for shareholders. Moving to dispositions. We recently completed with Blackstone, the recapitalization of Metropolitan Square, which is a 620,000 square foot office building, 75% leased, located in close proximity to the White House in Washington D.C. We\u2019ve reduced our interest from 51% to 20% and we\u2019ll retain the leasing and management of the property. Pricing on a 100% basis was $360 million, or $581 a square foot, and the building will likely require an additional $160 per square foot of capital to complete its repositioning. We realized $56 million of proceeds from the sale of our interest, net of existing financing, and we experienced a 14.2% leveraged IIR on the portion we sold over our 18-year period of ownership. We\u2019re also delighted to be developing a larger relationship with Blackstone through this transaction. We also closed in the third quarter the sale of a parcel in our Broad Run Business Park in in Loudoun County for $18 million. And finally, we\u2019ve withdrawn from the market our VA 95 Business Park in Springfield, Virginia. During the marketing process, the major tenet in the park, U.S. Customs issued an RFP for a consolidation in Northern Virginia. The result and uncertainty around retaining this tenet diminished investor interest in the assets, so ultimately, we could end up benefiting from the consolidation opportunity. We do not anticipate any additional sales in 2016, though we intend to continue to sell non-core assets in 2017 subject to market conditions. Including these transactions, in 2016, we will complete the monetization of three assets for total gross proceeds on an our share basis of $235 million, which is in line with projections provided at the beginning of the year. Moving to development, we remain active delivering assets into service, advancing our pre-development pipeline, and evaluating new investments. In terms of starts for the quarter, we commenced the full redevelopment of the 220,000 square foot low-rise building in 601 Lexington Avenue, 195,000 square foot office component of the building is being renamed 159 East 53rd Street and will have a new dedicated Street entrance and lobby providing branding opportunities for major tenant. The building is being re-clad creating 30% more vision glass, a new high efficiency HVAC system will be installed, and access to the building\u2019s extensive and redesigned outdoor terraces will be improved. The 25,000 square foot retail atrium is also being completely redeveloped with a prominent at great entrance on 53rd Street will house multiple dining amenities and a fitness center. Our share of the total budgeted cost of this project is $106 million, and we forecast the yield on the office component to be in line with our target NOI yield of 7% for development. Returns on the retail and outdoor plaza components will be partially driven by the enhancements we realized in lease rate and velocity due to this new amenity for our three major office assets at the 53rd Street \u2013 at 53rd Street Lexington Avenue. We also anticipate starting the development of an amenity building in the outdoor \u2013 existing outdoor plaza at 100 Federal Street in Boston in the fourth quarter. We remain active advancing our predevelopment pipeline for projects that would start after 2016. Several updates from this quarter include at Kendall Center in Cambridge, we are in the final stages of executing a lease with a major technology company to build their 476,000 square foot headquarters at 145 Broadway, which will require demolition of an existing 80,000 square foot low-rise building on the site. Total budgeted development costs are $517 million, or $1,086 per square foot with land at market value. In the first-year development, NOI yield is projected to be approximately 7%. The project will not commence until 2017 and efforts continue on developing commitments in projects for the remaining 600,000 square feet of potential entitlements at Kendall Center. We\u2019re pursuing \u2013 further, we\u2019re pursuing multiple new prelease development opportunities in the Washington D.C. region, all of which are potential 2017 starts. On deliveries, this month we delivered into service 1265 Main Street and Waltham, Mass. This \u2013 the building, which we own in partnership with a local developer is 115,000 square feet and a 100% leased to C&J Clark. We are generating a 7.7% yield on our $26 million investment in this redevelopment. At the end of the third quarter, our development pipeline now consist of eight new projects and two redevelopments, totaling 4 million square feet and $2.2 billion in projected costs. Our projected NOI yield for these developments is in excess of 7%, and the commercial component of the pipeline is 50% pre-let. We expect the addition of these projects to our in-service portfolio to add materially to our company\u2019s growth over the next three years. So to conclude, we continue to remain very enthusiastic about our prospects for creating shareholder value in the quarters ahead. We have a clear and achievable plan to materially grow FFO through the development and delivery of new buildings, as well as the lease up of existing assets for which we currently have a particularly strong backlog of potential leases. We selected non-core assets for sale to raise capital and ensure continued portfolio improvement. We have significant entitled and un-entitled land holdings that we will continue to push through the design and permitting process and add selectively to our development pipeline in future years. Our balance sheet remains strong with conservative leverage which will allow us to pursue and act on investment opportunities that present themselves in coming quarters. So let me turn the call over to Doug for further review of our markets. Douglas Linde : Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. So this is the third quarter and we introduced our 2017 earnings guidance last night, and I\u2019m going to devote my time this morning to providing the operating background that\u2019s behind our estimates and to describe the key drivers of our occupancy and revenue growth over the short-term, as well as those situations, where we have, in fact, completed transactions, signed leases, but are not going to be recognizing any revenue until 2018, and there\u2019s a significant amount of that. In a number of instances, our estimates reflect investment and repositioning decisions that were made during the past 12 months, which have a direct impact on our 2017 GAAP revenues, and I want to take the time to provide incremental impact of those decisions. So let me now give you some specifics on our regions, and I\u2019ll start with San Francisco. So during the first quarter, we completed 128,000 square feet at Embarcadero Center. During the second quarter, 158,000 square feet of leases, and during the third quarter, we completed an additional 219,000 square feet of leasing. All of these leases average a positive mark-to-market of more than 40% on a gross basis and 70% on a net basis, very consistent with the leasing spread we\u2019ve been reporting in our quarterly supplemental. The incremental revenue from the deals we\u2019ve now signed in San Francisco since the third quarter of last year is over $16.5 million, and will be at a full run rate starting in the third quarter of 2017. So overall market conditions we\u2019ve been describing in the last few quarters and the San Francisco CBD really remain the same. And while it may make a headline to write that the rate of activity in 2016 is not going to be quite at the level it was in 2015, which by the way was just off the peak market of 2014. We actually think the real news is the stability of the market in San Francisco CBD. Each quarter, there continues to be a new crop of significant technology companies lease expansion in addition to the traditional lease exploration driven market demand. This quarter, Twitch signed a lease at 350 Bush for 185,000 square feet; Fitbit took over 300,000 square feet off the sublet market; Lift has taken over 280,000 square feet at 185 Berry; Adobe is in the market and expanding by 200,000 square feet; Slack, which started our building 680 Folsom and a 11,000 square foot pre-built suite in 2014 is now looking for more than 200,000 square feet; and NerdWallet continues to be in the market for over 100,000 square feet. Continuing the trend we saw in the second quarter, high-quality well built sublet spaces hitting the market and getting quickly absorbed and has really served as the dominant large block availability. The largest block of sublet space in the market statistic last quarter was 400,000 square foot block at 211 Main. Well, Schwab renewed, so there\u2019s no more sublet availability. And the largest block of space on the market this quarter was up over \u2013 Twitter\u2019s buildings upon Upper Market and it appears now that space has been put under lease negotiation with a growing startup technology company. Sublet availability has remained flat with growing technology expansion compensating for additional availability. Sales force power is the tallest building in the city and we are now able to take prospective tenants up to the available floors and allow them to visually and physically experience the breath of vision glass, the calm three floors, the volume of the slab the slab height and the views. We have five floors under lease negotiation, which is what our expectation was for the year, and hope to have all of these leases signed by year end. Only one full floor future prospect is actually located at Embarcadero Center, so it\u2019s all incremental new demand. The structure of the building is up about 56 floors, and we expect to have our first tenants in occupancy in late 2017. I said this last quarter, but I want to repeat it again. We anticipate delivering the first block of space to Salesforce.com in the second quarter of 2017, and then we have four future delivery dates that extend into the fourth quarter of 2018. We do not recognize revenue until the tenants have completed their build out on a floor by floor basis, even though we\u2019re going to be receiving cash rent. Our 2017 earning estimates continue to assume, we\u2019re not going to record GAAP revenue from Salesforce.com lease in 2017. Rent commencement on the other four tenet floors is likely to start in the fourth quarter, with accompanying cessation of capitalized interest, but it\u2019s offset by the startup of operating expenses and taxes for the whole building. When the building is fully leased with tenants and occupancy, which we expect to occur in 2019, we anticipate an initial stabilized net operating income of between $80 million and $85 million. Our Mountain View activity continues to be very strong still. We\u2019re renewing our single storey product at over $55 triple net, so the occupancy gains are slower at 611 Gateway, we will start the year there with 186,000 square feet of availability and we\u2019re unlikely to see much incremental revenue from that space in 2017. Going down the coast to our new markets in West LA, activity there is robust and we anticipate signing leases for more than 200,000 square feet of our 380,000 \u2013 385,000 square feet of availability in the coming days, and extending another 190,000 square feet. The West LA market has had a string of strong quarters of rental rate growth, as it benefits from both the creativity and entrepreneurship of local content creators and providers, the explosion of new content from new economy entertainment companies, and the growing labor market for a number of San Francisco-based technology companies that are trying to broaden their workforce reach. Since July, the submarket has seen more than 400,000 square feet of signed leases and there\u2019s another 790,000 square feet of activity in the market, including our transactions in process. Rents have moved more than 10% for these large blocks of space since our purchase in July. I want to start my discussion in the New York region with our retail tenancy. At 250 250 West 55th, we have signed the lease for 55,000, including the second floor with the operator of an experiential, thematic visitor destination that expects to be open by the end of 2017. Since the space needs to be improved, we have not included any revenue in our 2017 estimates, but the space is leased. You will recall that our 2016 results included termination income equivalent to 4.5 years of rent. We expect to replace this income from this space after 23 months. At 767 5th, we have more clarity on the timing of the retail revenue from the various spaces. We expect to deliver the space to Under Armour in the second-half of 2018. So going back, in 2014, prior to the termination of the FAO Schwarz lease when all of the retail was released, we had about $64 million of revenue from the retail spaces at the General Motors building. All this space is now committed, but in 2017, as we work through the transition, we will have about $51 million of revenue. In the second-half of 2018, when the transition is complete, we anticipate an annual run rate of over $85 million of revenue with a pretty conservative projection for percentage rents from the tenants. We own 60% of this joint venture. We\u2019re not anticipating any office rent growth and probably slightly higher concessions around our Midtown office portfolio in 2017. The conditions we have been describing for the last few years remain in control. New supply continues to come into the market. The large financial players continue to shrink their cost structures and in certain instances, they\u2019ve chosen to move to new owned facilities on the far West Side creating additional inventory. Landlords that are putting capital into older assets are attracting tenants. Major League Baseball at 1271 6th Avenue just took 400,000 square feet and Hogan Lovells at 390 Madison Avenue just took 250,000 square feet being the most recent example. The market is active for larger tenants in the mid-80s across Midtown, while the market for space over $100 a square obviously has less velocity. I think the most significant change in our Manhattan leasing is that, we have seen a significant pick up in demand for our two floors, the available floors at 767 Fifth Avenue, which totaled about 80,000 square feet. We have a lease for 24,000 square feet out for execution, we actually expect to get it signed today. And we have three other tenants looking at between 40,000 and 20,000 square feet. Again, we won\u2019t recognize revenue in 2017, but the expected contribution is over $7.5 million from this 80,000 square feet. If you look at it statistically, there\u2019s actually been a significant amount of space leased at over $100 a square foot. And that even excludes the Citadel lease at $425, more than, in fact, in 2015, but the typical relocation deal is still under 10,000 square feet. So you have to do a lot of deals to lease space. Our total New York regional activity in the third quarter was about 113,000 square feet. We\u2019re negotiating leases for 60,000 of our 87,000 square feet of 2017 rollover at $599 priced in the 80\u2019s, and we expect to receive income from some of those spaces in 2017. We completed the relocation of all of the tenants from the low-rise at 159 East \u2013 159 East 53rd Street. This was our one opportunity to dramatically rebuild the space in conjunction with our plan to reintroduce the public spaces. In order to complete the work, we took back 70,000 square feet in 2016, which resulted in termination payments and a rent roll down, which is why you see negative statistics in our supplemental in the New York region this quarter. When we made this decision proceed with this investment in late 2015, we recognized that we were going to be reducing the pro rata share of the revenue from the office space by about $5.5 million, that\u2019s what we\u2019re experiencing in 2017. We\u2019re now marketing 195,000 square foot block of space that we hope to deliver to tenants in 2018 with revenue commencing in 2019. At 399 Park Avenue, we\u2019ve commenced an extensive renovation and have leased about 204,000 square feet of the coming up rollover and we have another 0.5 million square feet that is uncommitted, including about 100,000 square feet of concourse space that\u2019s currently rented at about $45 a square foot. The existing lease expirations from Citi and the law firm expire in August and September of 2017. And while we expect to lease significant portions of the space during the year, we anticipate having to remove the existing improvements and may not have tenants in place with the revenue recognition until 2018. Our other New York City assets have a very modest near-term expirations or vacancies. We\u2019ve signed leases or negations ongoing that will create significant amounts of incremental income, but the opportunities to drive 2017 revenue are limited. Going down to D.C. The D.C. CBD office market fundamentals have not experienced much in the way of new demand generators. And we haven\u2019t really seen any demonstrable positive change in the leasing market. Landlords are competing on any available space and concessions in D.C. on leases of 10 years or more typically include a year of free rent and more than $110 of tenant improvement allowances. D.C. is truly a forward leasing market for any sizeable space. But there continues to be speculative buildings under construction, believe it or not, aging beauties that are being repositioned and 11 operational buildings with between 100,000 and 400,000 square feet of available space. That\u2019s the market we\u2019re dealing with. The GSA continues to have a very measured approach to its renewal and we\u2019re not aware of any requirements that are net generators of demand. We\u2019re negotiating short-term renewals with the GSA for 196,000 square feet of our 2017 lease expirations. In spite of the challenging environment, we\u2019re chipping away at all of our availability with about half of the 47,000 square feet of available space under negotiation at 601 Mass, that\u2019s the building that opened late last September. And we have another half a dozen leases under 15,000 square feet either signed or in active negotiations on our other D.C. asset \u2013 CBD asset. In Reston, we completed another six leases totaling 69,000 square feet, where the average starting rent still is in the mid-50s. And we have made two proposals to large users for our proposed new 270,000 Signature development. Our Reston portfolio continues to be 97% leased leaving us with a very small smattering of availability. There\u2019s actually been a pick up of activity at our VA 95 product, the product that Owen was describing, and we\u2019re actually in negotiations with two tenants for between 53,000 and 69,000 square feet of our availability there. And we also picked up another 31,000 square foot tenant at our AJ 6 building in Maryland. As Owen reported, we are close to executing a lease for an approximately 476,000 square foot office building on the site of our existing 97,000 square foot office building 145 Broadway. We are moving through the formal review process with the City of Cambridge. We anticipate vacating 145 Broadway during the second quarter of 2017, and commencing construction soon after. We are eliminating, taking off the board $2.3 million of income on an annualized basis until the building comes into service in December of 2019. This is captured in our 2017 projection. I think you\u2019re starting to get the theme. The demand growth in our Boston suburban portfolio continues to outpace the other submarkets. This quarter, we completed 173,000 square feet of leases and we have more than 475,000 square feet of renewals and relocations with growing tenants in progress. High-quality space is at a premium and we anticipate additional rent growth in 2017. One of our negotiations is for our building at 173 Tracer Lane, which we took out of service in 2016 in order to complete a major refurbishment. We spent an incremental $16 million and expect to increase the income by more than $1.2 million when the tenant takes initial occupancy during the third quarter of 2017. This is yet another example of a purposely forgoing current income in order to create higher long-term value. The Boston CBD market continues to be a lease expiration-driven market with a steady flow of new technology companies. One of the more interesting phenomenon is that all the large users that have been entering the \u201cInnovation District, or the Seaport area\u201d are for the most part traditional FIREA tenants seeking new large blocks of space and most of the smaller and growing technology companies have located in the Financial District, uptown, which is what we call the North Station area, or the Backbay. During the quarter, we leased about 50,000 square feet in our CBD portfolio. But this month, we expect to complete 64,000 square feet of leasing at 888 Boylston Street, again, I think the lease will get done in the next day or so, bringing us to 89% leased. We\u2019ve signed 108,000 square feet at the Prudential Center, including 76,000 square feet of new tenants, bringing the occupancy in the Prudential Center to 98%, and we\u2019ve signed 54,000 square feet at 120 St. James, the low-rise portion of 200 Clarendon. As we discussed on our last call, 888 is not going to hit its stabilized run rate until November of 2017 when Natixis occupies floors 4 through 10, or 154,000 square feet. And while we\u2019ve leased more than 1.2 million square feet at 200 Clarendon since we took possession in 2011 and it\u2019s a 1.6 million square foot building, we still have 120,000 square feet of low-rise space and 125,000 square feet of high-rise. While the low-rise space is very attractive to nonfinancial tenants, the high-rise floors continue to be driven by traditional lease expiration-driven users and the activity in this area has been less robust. We expect to lease a large portion of the space over the next 12 months, but we are not projecting revenue in 2017. In summary, we\u2019ve executed on a significant portion of our plan and we have a significant amount of contractual revenues in both our operating properties and our development assets that will increase our earnings over the coming years. We\u2019ve now executed on about $72 million of our $80 million bridge, but we still have a few significant lease expirations that were part of that bridge that we will still need to cover. And with that, I will turn the call to Mike. Michael LaBelle : Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning. I\u2019m just going to start with a couple of quick comments on our balance sheet and then I will jump to our earnings results and our guidance. We completed a significant transaction in the debt markets this past quarter. We raised a $1 billion 10-year bond issuance at 2.75% coupon. If you include the settlement of a portion of our hedges, the all-in GAAP interest rate on that financing is 3.5%. We used the proceeds to repay two mortgages that had a weighted average GAAP interest rate of about 5.9%. So you will see the impact of the 240 basis point reduction show up as lower interest expense in our run rate going forward. Our cash balances have dropped to just over $400 million after the acquisition of Colorado Center, funding of our developments and the repayment of debt. We project our development spend to approach $1 billion through the end of 2017, and we anticipate either using our currently untapped line of credit, or raising additional debt capital as a partial funding source. Our guidance currently assumes the use of our line. Though it\u2019s certainly possible that we may complete a new debt issuance and hold the cash short-term, which would be dilutive to our earnings guidance. With the run-up in Treasury rates over the past couple of months, our borrowing cost for 10 years in the bond market is currently about 3.2%. If you assume a $500 million debt issuance at the beginning of 2017, it would reduce our 2017 earnings guidance by about $0.05 a share. The other major debt transaction that we have our eye on is the pending refinancing of our $1.6 billion mortgage on 767 5th Avenue that expires next October. This is a consolidated joint venture with our share being 60%, and we expect to refinance it in the mortgage market. We currently account for this loan under fair value accounting, so the GAAP interest rate is only about 3%. With the mortgage market currently pricing comparable large loans in the mid-3% range, the refinancing will likely increase our GAAP interest expense. We\u2019ve also entered into hedges for $450 million of this at a 10-year Treasury rate of 2.60% that will impact the transaction. The current cash interest rate on the loan is 6%. So on a cash basis, we anticipate a significant reduction in the interest rate that should enter into our cash flow. Our earnings for the quarter were reported at $1.42 per share, which was a $0.01 above the midpoint of our guidance range. Our portfolio performed ahead of our expectations, generating NOI of approximately $3 million above our projection, due to a combination of rental revenue outperformance and operating expense savings. The majority of the revenue beat came from San Francisco, where we completed a number of leases earlier than we projected, including some renewals with strong rollups that we started to straight line upon signing. As you can see in our mark-to-market stats, we continue to experience dramatic rent rollups on our activity in San Francisco. The outperformance in the portfolio was offset by a $1.8 million impairment we booked this quarter on a land parcel in suburban Maryland. This is the last parcel we own in a land assemblage we have considered exiting over the past several years, having sold two other parcels and booking gains totaling $5.5 million. Our FFO guidance for the rest of 2016 of $5.97 to $5.99 represents an increase of $0.03 per share at the midpoint from last quarter\u2019s guidance. All of the increase emanates from the performance of the portfolio due primarily to leasing success in the Boston and San Francisco markets. Our guidance now assumes our share of 2016 combined same property cash NOI growth of between 3.5% and 4% over 2015, which is at the high end of our prior range. As you look at 2017, the most important factor to remember is the impact of the amount of termination income that we recorded in 2016. We project 2016 termination income of approximately $58 million. The lion\u2019s share of this came from one large termination at 250 West 55th Street and several at 601 Lexington Avenue, where we needed to relocate tenants from the low-rise to the high-rise in order to allow our redevelopment to move ahead. Our 2017 guidance assumes only modest termination income. So this represents a loss of $0.31 per share of projected FFO from 2016 to 2017. In the portfolio, Doug described our activity in New York City and Boston, where we\u2019re successfully signing leases and letters of intent, but much of the impact will be in 2018. Although some of our leasing efforts will not result in immediate revenue recognition, we do assume solid growth in same property portfolio in 2017. In Boston, we\u2019ve signed leases on virtually all of the vacant space at the Prudential Tower and we expect Eataly and the rest of the Prudential shops\u2019 releasing effort to be open and revenue-generating by the first quarter. We also start to deliver floors to Putnam at 100 Federal Street and we expect moderate additional lease up at 200 Clarendon Street. In aggregate, our guidance assumes this activity adds $17 million to $25 million of incremental NOI to 2017. In San Francisco, we\u2019ve had a tremendous success both leasing up our vacancy and rolling up rents on renewals at Embarcadero Center this year. This was reflected in 2016, but will be even stronger in 2017, where we project an incremental $18 million to $25 million of NOI, equating to growth of more than 10% for the region. On a cash basis, the growth is even greater as the cash mark-to-market takes hold on our early renewal activity. The impact of the growth we are experiencing in Boston and San Francisco from both increased occupancy and a rollup to higher rental rates is projected to be partially offset by a decline in the contribution from the New York portfolio. The contribution from the Washington portfolio is projected to be relatively flat. As Doug described, in New York City, we will not see any real impact from the significant leasing we are doing at 767 5th Avenue and at 250 West 55th Street until 2018. We expect a temporary loss of income from 500,000 square feet of rollover at 399 Park Avenue in the second-half of the year. Overall, our guidance assumes NOI from the New York City portfolio to be down $5 million to $10 million in 2017 from 2016. So, in aggregate, our guidance assumes our share of combined same-property NOI to grow between 2% and 3.5% in 2017 over 2016. And on a cash basis, we assume between 2% and 4% growth of our share of combined same-property NOI over the same period. Our non-same property portfolio includes our [Audio Gap] and the impact of taking buildings out of service for redevelopment. Our redevelopment projects include 159 East 53rd Street in New York; 145 Broadway in Cambridge; and one of our suburban Boston assets, 191 Spring Street. We expect these redevelopments to generate an accretive development return on investment, but in 2017 will result in the loss of approximately $8 million of NOI compared to 2016. This includes both lost rental income, as well as the expensing of demolition costs that we project at $4 million in 2016 and $7 million in 2017. On the positive side, we expect to generate NOI growth from a full-year of the acquisition of Colorado Center and from our development deliveries. Though, as Doug described, our development deliveries will be much more impactful to 2018 based upon the anticipated occupancy dates for our major pre-leases. In aggregate, our guidance assumes our non-same property portfolio will add an incremental $18 million to $30 million of NOI in 2017. The other area, where we expect significant change in our earnings in 2017 is through lower interest expense from the combination of debt refinancing completed in 2016, as well as higher capitalized interest associated with our development pipeline. Our guidance for 2017 assumes net interest expense of between $378 million and $391 million, which is a reduction of $21 million at the midpoint from 2016. We assume capitalized interest to be between $50 million and $60 million in 2017. So in summary, based on these assumptions, we project our 2017 funds from operation to be between $6.05 and $6.23. This is an increase of $0.16 per share from the midpoint of our 2016 projected FFO. At the midpoint, the increase in FFO over 2016 is the result of $0.23 per share of growth from our share of our combined same property portfolio; $0.14 per share of incremental NOI from development deliveries and acquisitions; $0.12 per share from lower interest expense; a penny per share from higher development and management services income that we project to be offset by a reduction of $0.03 per share from higher G&A expense and $0.31 per share of lower projected termination income. Again the biggest item to consider when looking at our 2017 FFO growth is the impact of all the termination income that we recorded in 2016 that is not projected at anywhere near the same level in 2017. If you exclude the impact of termination income, our FFO per share at the midpoint of our guidance range is projected to be up 8.5% over 2016. I also want to make a quick comment on our dividend. Our estimate for 2016 taxable income before gains on sale is roughly in line with our current dividend rate of $2.60 per share. As we forecast the income generated from our development pipeline delivering over the next few years, combined with the anticipated organic growth in the portfolio and assuming moderating asset sales, our taxable income is projected to grow meaningfully. We\u2019ve been working with our Board on evaluating our dividend strategy and anticipate that our annual dividend will likely increase in both the short-term and the longer-term to continue to match our taxable income to our dividend. That completes our formal remarks. Operator, can you open the line up for questions? Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Alexander Goldfarb : Good morning. Owen, just the first question is with the JV with Blackstone down at Metropolitan Square in D.C., can you just give a little bit more perspective on sort of how we should think about the relationship with Blackstone? Is this going to be where, as they have buildings that they are putting on the market, we may see you guys partner and buy into those buildings, or is it more selling parts of your portfolio, or is it the two companies both going out and pursuing new acquisitions together? Owen Thomas : Yes, I \u2013 good morning, Alex. Look, I think that we\u2019ve done actually two important transactions with Blackstone this year. We purchased the half interest in Colorado Center from them and we are doing this recapitalization at Metropolitan Square. I don\u2019t think I would read anything more into it than just that. Clearly, we have a good relationship and a tremendous amount of respect for Blackstone and we are very open and welcome to doing new business together. But I think it will be very situation Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then the second question is, on LA for future investment, your comments sounded a little bit as though we should be patient. But maybe you could just frame some perspective just, when you look at the companies out there, whether it\u2019s Dougie or Hudson, they are buying like individual deals, or maybe a portfolio like Westwood, but a number of the properties that meet sort of the Boston criteria don\u2019t seem as widespread, at least to those of us. So maybe if you could just provide a little bit more perspective on what you guys see as the opportunity set both in aggregate and then maybe as far as timing if it\u2019s something that\u2019s within \u2013 we should wait another six months, or it may be another 12 plus before we see more investment? Owen Thomas : Yes. So the strategy, as you know, and as we\u2019ve been articulating is the investment in Colorado Center isn\u2019t one-off. I mean, we clearly feel that we are going to make a profitable investment in Colorado Center, which is great and was certainly one of the objectives, and the other objective was to get us into the LA market, which we think will be an attractive and important market for the company over the long term. But we don\u2019t intend to go out and make new investments just to grow in LA. Each investment, as Colorado Center did has to stand on its own, and in our opinion create attractive returns for shareholders. And so what I think and if you also look at the overall company, we entered the San Francisco market in the late 1990s and it still is the smallest region of all \u2013 of the four primary markets of the company; here we are nearly 20 years later. So our intent is to grow. We view the investment in LA as strategic, but we are going to wait for opportunities that, again, we think make sense and cancel from a return perspective. And so where we are in the market today, I don\u2019t think you should expect us to go out and purchase stabilized assets in a 4% kind of cap rate environment. Those are not the kinds of things that we are going to be doing. We are going to be looking at new developments. We are going to be looking at assets that need some repositioning or lease-up. Our focus will be on a handful of markets in West LA, and I don\u2019t think you should put a confined timeframe on it like 6 months or 12 months, we are going to be careful and patient and wait for the right opportunity. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. That\u2019s helpful, Owen. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi. Emmanuel Korchman : Mike, a question for you. How much taking the properties out to put them into the redevelopment pool instead of same-store pool impact same-store growth? Said differently, if you hadn\u2019t re-classed them and you said these are properties we own, we are doing work, but they are coming out of the pool, what would same-store growth be then? Michael LaBelle : I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that significant 2016 to 2017. I mean, we\u2019ve talked about $8 million of reduction. I think that if we didn\u2019t pull them out in the 2015 to 2016 at this point, I mean, it will probably come out in the fourth quarter, so we will have one quarter of 601 being out for the low-rise, which will be \u2013 which is \u2013 will be a little bit of impact. I think, which will have a little bit of an impact. But I would say, it\u2019s 25 basis points maybe to 50 basis points something like that. Emmanuel Korchman : Okay. And on Colorado Center, you said you have deals that are close. How much capital is it going to take to get those deals in place, or is it going to be just more normal TI type spend? Douglas Linde : So the deals that we have in place are not legally conditioned on us doing any work to the exterior areas of the buildings. There\u2019s a tenant improvement contribution for each of the deals and I think the \u2013 I mean, the general market is in the $70 to $80 a square foot for a 10-year deal and it\u2019s closer to $100 a square foot for a 15-year deal. And but we intend to do a major repositioning of the properties and we have a plan that we\u2019ve come up with that we\u2019ve discussed with TIA who are the other party in the transaction and we don\u2019t have a firm budget on that yet, but it\u2019s somewhere \u2013 more than $10 million and probably less than $25 million, and we will have to come to an agreement internally and with them on what the right amount of spend is and how long it will take. But that will be more of a global repositioning as opposed to what\u2019s required for these deals. These deals don\u2019t have any requirement from a legal perspective to spend money. Michael LaBelle : Manny, the number is about 50 basis points. It\u2019s about $8 million on about $1.350 billion of our share same-store. Emmanuel Korchman : Thanks, Mike. Last one for me. Is there any agreement with salesforce in place, or any option in place where if they want more space at Salesforce Tower, they get it, or is it a new negotiation for new space? Douglas Linde : So our lease with salesforce.com includes just the space that they have on, quote unquote their existing lease. So we have the unfettered right to lease other space to other tenants. You would think that the major 800,000 square foot tenant would be an important customer. And so to the extent we are doing things on other parts of the building, we are letting them know what\u2019s going on. So to the extent that they have an interest in that space. They can give us their view on how we might work with them on it. Emmanuel Korchman : Great. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick with Capital One Securities. Thomas Lesnick : Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, first, going back to the discussion about financing for 2017, and specifically mortgage debt, can you comment at all on what the appetite for balance sheet debt by life cos looks like relative to the CMBS market right now? Owen Thomas : I think both have strong appetites. I think the CMBS market has come back very strong in the summertime after kind of a weak volatile first quarter and beginning of the second quarter and life companies were actually holding back a little bit, because they wanted to have a more even outflow. So they kind of held back in the first-half and now CMBS is more competitive than they are. You\u2019ve got swap rates that are below Treasury rates and you\u2019ve got \u2013 the \u2013 for leverage rates that are 50% to 60%, the spreads are very, very tight on CMBS, so they\u2019re competitive. So I think now the life companies are trying to become more competitive and put out capital. They have more to put out by the end of the year. So I think it\u2019s pretty competitive. I think that when we look at 767 5th Avenue, that\u2019s a big loan. That is going to be more aligned with the CMBS market, I would imagine, because you would have to put together many other life companies to put that together given its size and the fact that most life companies are maxing out at a couple hundred million to maybe $400 million at most, or we could do a large kind of bank loan transaction, which is actually what we have today when we originally did the deal. Thomas Lesnick : Got it. Appreciate that. That\u2019s helpful. And then my other question, on the redevelopment of the low-rise at 601 Lex, how are you guys thinking about positioning rents for that space relative to kind of a \u2013 in the wide range of rents in Midtown? Owen Thomas : John, do you want to take that one? John Powers : That\u2019s a very unique product and we are very, very excited about it. It\u2019s got light and air, but no views. It\u2019s got a very good location. So that will be positioned to be in the high 80s. [Multiple Speakers] and as 10% of the entire space is outdoor space [indiscernible]. Thomas Lesnick : Great. Thank you very much. John Powers : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Blaine Heck : Thanks. Owen or Doug, it sounds like you guys have a lot of situations where the lag between signed leases and occupancy or innovation are delaying the recognition of income. But on the flipside, can you talk about anywhere that you think maybe there\u2019s currently vacant space that could be leased quick enough to become income-producing before the end of the year and maybe provide some upside to guidance? Douglas Linde : So I\u2019m hesitant to answer that question too aggressively, because the circumstances under which we deliver the space are so critical to when we recognize or have the ability to recognize revenue. So we can sign leases and be in a position where the space is committed, and if we deliver the space in one condition, we are recognizing revenue day one and if we are delivering it after having removed the existing improvements, it could be 10 months, or 12 months, or 6 months delayed. So Mike\u2019s numbers have some of that baked into them in terms of his projections for our same-store growth for the year, but it\u2019s pretty muted because of the issues associated with the delivery conditions. So I think we will do more leasing. I don\u2019t know whether or not we will be able to get impact from it in our 2017 numbers. Blaine Heck : Okay. Fair enough. And then it looked as though CapEx was higher than normal again this quarter and I know it can be a little bit of a lagging indicator since it\u2019s on leases commenced during the quarter. But can you guys just talk a little bit more \u2013 you touched on it in New York. But what are you seeing in each of your markets with respect to concessions and are you getting any pushback in any of the markets to increase free rent or TIs? Douglas Linde : So I would tell you that overall in our markets, if you had to pick a direction, concessions are moderately up as opposed to moderately down. I think in New York City, many landlords have taken the recipe that we\u2019ve been working with for a number of years and pre-building space, and if you pre-build the suite, you are giving a lot more money in the space than you are when you are giving an allowance. But in theory you are reducing the free rent concession significantly and or improving your velocity. I described the transaction environment in Washington DC. It\u2019s pretty close to where it was last year, maybe it\u2019s slightly higher. I think the greater San Francisco market, it\u2019s actually \u2013 concessions have come down a little bit in the sense that many tenants are sort of deciding that renewing in place on average is a more economical experience for them because of the cost associated with having to relocate. So if you have a tenant in place, you can get away with a smaller concession than with a new tenant coming into that space. And then in the Boston market, the CBD is \u2013 probably had slight increase in its tenant improvement numbers not significant. Pre-rent really hasn\u2019t become a factor in this market at all. And our suburban market actually, I think has seen a decrease overall in concessions, because \u2013 honestly, because of the stronger market and the availability of high-quality space is becoming limited. Blaine Heck : Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS. Nick Yulico : Thanks. Mike, you mentioned that you are going to do a little over 8% FFO growth next year if you exclude the termination income. And so I\u2019m wondering whether FFO or AFFO growth could get even better than that in 2018 and beyond since you still have a fair amount of releasing of vacancy and development NOI to hit, which I think is a greater amount of benefit after 2017? Michael LaBelle : I think that we don\u2019t want to talk too much about 2018. But I think if you look at what we have, we\u2019ve got a significant amount of space at 200 Clarendon and 120 St. James that is today roughly 350,000 square feet of availability that is zero today, which is meaningful space. So I think that -- and we\u2019ve got some other rollups in Boston, suburban Boston and Cambridge. So I think the Boston market will do very well. I think San Francisco will continue to do well. We have dealt with a lot of our rollover, but we\u2019ve still got a little bit more to go that has rollups and we still have a few floors of vacant space. And then in New York City, Doug talked about 767 and 250 West 55th Street. Now we do have to release the 399 Park space. So depending on how quickly that comes in, that could be a negative for that year. And then, obviously, our development pipeline, we will have a full run rate of 888 Boylston Street and then salesforce will start to have a real impact to us. I think there\u2019s some very positive things for 2018. Nick Yulico : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I guess just one other one on Salesforce Tower. Can you go back and explain a little bit more about \u2013 someone was talking about the operating expense, I guess hitting for the full building at some point I think at the end of 2017, along with the removal of capitalized interest and is that an issue that affects 2017 much, or is that more of a 2018 issue? Michael LaBelle : The way that we capitalize taxes are that we continue to capitalize them on the percentage of the space that is not leased up to 12 months basically after we deliver the building. But the other \u2013 most of the other operating expenses, you do have to start to ramp up for utilities and other things and you can\u2019t capitalize those types of things. So in the very beginning of your occupancy, you have a tough time getting positive NOI. But obviously as you lease up, you start to get that leverage. Nick Yulico : Okay. And just quickly, could we also just get the capitalized interest assumption for 2017? Thanks. Michael LaBelle : I think we said $50 million to $60 million of capitalized interest for 2017. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Jamie Feldman : Great. Thank you. I guess just to start, Doug, did I hear you say that you are $72 million done of the $80 million leasing target for the repositioning NOI? Douglas Linde : Yes, so what I \u2013 so we\u2019ve been keeping this running total and so we\u2019ve done $72 million of $80 million on the revenue side. But remember number there\u2019s a net reduction from some leases that were expiring that sort of go against that. So I\u2019m giving you a gross number, not a net number. So there\u2019s another call it $15 million to $17 million that\u2019s sort of part of that $80 million that we still have to get done. But on an apples-to-apples basis from what we\u2019ve been reporting from the beginning of the year, we started with zero and we\u2019ve gotten $72 million of $80 million and then we have some negatives that have come on that we have to still cover. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then, Mike, you talked about a potential $0.05 drag from a debt deal early in the year. Is that in your guidance, or you are saying if you do it, it would be another drag? Michael LaBelle : If we do it, it would be a drag. So we\u2019ve assumed in our guidance that we are using our line of credit as we need it. So we\u2019ve got some interest expense in our guidance associated with our line of credit, which we draw on as we need the money. So it gets drawn throughout the year. But it\u2019s certainly possible, again, that we could do something much sooner than that and then we would sit on the cash and the cash doesn\u2019t earn much. So I gave an example of $500 million, because that\u2019s the approximate amount of capital we would need to fund out most of our pipeline. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then do you have a view on AFFO for 2017 based on your guidance in your dividend? Michael LaBelle : What I can give you is some of the pieces to kind of help you. If you look at our projections for what we need to lease to meet our plan, we need to lease something like 3.5 million square feet of space. So depending on how much cost you throw at that, that\u2019s probably somewhere in the $200 million plus or minus range for costs that would get hit there. Non-cash rents, we gave guidance for that of $50 million to $70 million. And I think that we would say maintenance CapEx is probably somewhere in the $60 million to $80 million range. If you look at other non-cash expenses that we have, that would offset that probably between $35 million and $45 million. So you\u2019re talking about total adjustments to our FFO of $280 million to $320 million something like that. That would bring you down probably to, I don\u2019t know, $4.25 to $4.50 or something like that on a per share basis, just dropping that off the guidance that I guess. Jamie Feldman : Yep. And then I guess going back to the same-store question for 2018, just kind of back of the envelope, do you guys have a sense as you were going through the numbers of where you are shaping up for 2018 same-store and what kind of pop you get over 2017 based on what\u2019s in motion? Michael LaBelle : We\u2019ve got projections, obviously. But there\u2019s a lot that can change and a lot can happen. We don\u2019t really want to get into 2018 guidance at this point. Jamie Feldman : Okay. That\u2019s fair. And then my last fundamental question on New York City. You gave some interesting color on market leasing and some demand you\u2019re getting in your buildings. I think you also said the $80-ish rent market is pretty good. How are you guys thinking several years out on New York City? I guess, as everyone kind of thinks about the moving pieces in the market, how do you guys think about what you are expecting? Owen Thomas : John, do you want to try that one first? John Powers : Well, I\u2019m very consistent. I\u2019m very bullish on New York City. I think the New York population is going up. All the indicators here are positive. There\u2019s not as much job growth as last year, but there is job growth this year. I think the hotels are doing well and it\u2019s a very good market. So we think it will continue to draw people into the market, the tech sector, the TAMI sector is growing. So the long-term is bullish. We do have some supply, as we\u2019ve talked about, coming on with the Trade Center primarily and the rail yards and that will be absorbed over the next couple of years. Owen Thomas : And I guess in terms of prospects to push rents, [Multiple Speakers] flatten out, do you think that continues? John Powers : I\u2019m not bullish on rents moving up. I don\u2019t think \u2013 I think there will be some areas in the city, in some particular buildings where rents will move and there will be some places that will be a little softer, but I\u2019m pretty flat overall for the next couple years on rents. Owen Thomas : Okay. Anyone else want to chime in? Douglas Linde : Jamie, I think we\u2019ve been saying for, I think several years now that, as John articulated, New York is a healthy market. It\u2019s a desirable city. There is job creation. I think the mix of industries is getting more diverse in a very positive way. So all that\u2019s very positive, but there is a fair amount of supply. It\u2019s significant on a square foot basis. It\u2019s less significant on a percent of total stock basis, but it matters. And so when we\u2019ve run our numbers, we see availability in New York. It\u2019s hard to push it below 10% and when you are in an environment like that, it\u2019s hard to push rents certainly above inflation and we\u2019ve been saying that and we\u2019ve been in many cases leasing our portfolio with that type of philosophy. John Powers : Yes, that\u2019s all true. But also on the other side of that, we don\u2019t see the availability going to 12%. It takes a lot of movement to move it from 11% to 12%. So it\u2019s pushing somewhere around 11% aggregate in the city and we have some pipeline coming on over the next couple of years, small, as Owen said, a small percentage relative to the 400 million square foot market here, but nonetheless space that will impact the market. So we are going to be somewhere around a 11%. That\u2019s what the availability rate overall Manhattan is going to be at the end of the year. Fourth quarter leasing velocity will probably move up. It should hit close to the 25 million that\u2019s the average over the last 12 years. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Rob Simone : Hey, guys, it\u2019s Rob Simone standing in for Steve. Just kind of like stepping back and at a high level, you guys are going to do call it $1.3 billion of NOI roughly this year. And I guess our question is, once all the developments are placed in service, the biggest portion obviously being salesforce, and once you guys are through the majority or all of your planned leasing, what\u2019s kind of like the run rate cash NOI we should be or GAAP NOI that we should be thinking about looking three years out when all of this activity, which will quarter-to-quarter introduce a lot of noise to the results, is finished, what\u2019s that bogey you guys are targeting? Douglas Linde : I\u2019m going to answer that question in a terribly unhelpful way, which is I don\u2019t think we are in a position where we feel comfortable giving you a projection three years out. We\u2019ve given you a lot of pieces and we\u2019ve described the average return on cost of our development pipeline and the delivery of those dollars. So if you are assuming, I mean, 7% is a number that we are using as sort of a surrogate. The number is actually going to be higher than that on a GAAP basis, because we are describing cash yields and obviously cash yields don\u2019t include the increases in rents that you straight line and they don\u2019t include, as Owen, for example said, what our market land value is. That\u2019s a non-cash item, or non-GAAP item, so the numbers are going to be higher. And if you take that and then Mike gives a pretty good same-store revenue number, I wish I could tell you that we can give you more than that, but I think that\u2019s what you are going to have to work with to come up with our three-year projection, if you want to call it that. Rob Simone : Yes, no, no, that\u2019s helpful. I know obviously it\u2019s a long way out. I guess it\u2019s a lot of \u2013 it\u2019s just a lot of activity that\u2019s kind of happening concurrent to each other and it\u2019s also not going to be a straight line up, obviously. So, yes, that\u2019s helpful. I get it. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Thank you. Just two granular questions on New York. 250 West, can you outline the prospects for the remaining space, particularly on the retail left on the ground floor that I think is helping you with? Douglas Linde : Sure. So we have one retail space left and we have a letter of intent on that space with a restauranteur. Vikram Malhotra : And then just any other space on the office side? Douglas Linde : Yes. So we have on the 36th floor, which is available and half of the 35th floor. And we have discussions going on with smaller tenants on the 35th floor and we, at the moment, don\u2019t have any active conversations on the 36th floor. Vikram Malhotra : And then just on retail going to the Plaza District, just want to get your thoughts on retail on 5th Avenue kind of around 50, 57th Street versus off-5th. And I\u2019m just trying to understand this commentary on some weakness in certain parts of Plaza, but just want to get your thoughts on how the prospects are for on-5th versus off. Douglas Linde : So I will give you a macro answer and then, John Powers, you can provide some micro if you want. So Boston Properties has leased all of their 5th Avenue space for the next 17 or 18 years. So we are not in the market on 5th Avenue any longer. We will have a small space on Madison Avenue coming up in the middle of 2016 \u2013 2017 and another space towards the end of the year and they are both 1,000 to 3,000 square feet. And our view is that the market on Madison Avenue has gotten marginally better than where it was three or four years ago. So if three or four years ago, we thought the market was $850 to $900 a square foot, today, I think we think the market is from $1,000 to $1,200 a square foot. John, do you have any other comments? John Powers : No, I think that covers it. Vikram Malhotra : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors. Jed Reagan : Hey, good morning, guys. Just following on the New York questions. I guess what trends are you seeing in terms of net effective rents in Manhattan year-to-date and is there any difference at the high-end of the market versus kind of the more moderate price points? Douglas Linde : I think that it depends on how you define that. So I think that the way the market is working is that when you have \u2013 and most of the Midtown activity is lease expiration-driven, there\u2019s not a tremendous amount of growth that when you have a lease expiration tenancy and they have a particular day on which their space is leasing, the market has become more flexible on meeting that date. So where it used to be that, in a bit of a stronger market, if you had a lease expiration on January 1 of 2018, and the traditional 10-year deal was 12 months of free rent and $65 or $75 of TIs, that would be what the transaction package would be. Today, if you have a lease expiration on January 30, or February 1, or March 30, or April 1, you might get the same concession package, but your rent commencement date would be a little bit drawn out. So effectively your NER, if you want to call it that, has gone down slightly, but it\u2019s, in reality, just a way to meet the demand of the marketplace as opposed to actually increase concessions, and I think that\u2019s the flexibility that\u2019s being required. In addition, as I said before, Jed, there is more landlord-oriented work that is going on in Manhattan in the form of pre-built or other landlord-required obligations to tenant spaces. So there has been a push-up in concessions in that way. Jed Reagan : But you haven\u2019t necessarily seen the face rent growth to offset some of those higher concessions? Douglas Linde : John, I don\u2019t believe we have? You can comment. John Powers : No, I don\u2019t think we have. And, as Doug said, yes, in a market that\u2019s got some vacancy at 11% availability and some balancing between tenants and landlord, tenants still have sometimes limited opportunities. They might have two or three things even though with all the space in the market in terms of where they want to go, their size, what\u2019s available, their timing, et cetera. But because of the market we are in with this balance, landlords are pushing out and looking at future lease expirations and matching that so the tenant doesn\u2019t have double rent, as Doug said. And that pulls the NER down, but that\u2019s forward leasing and that\u2019s consistent with most lease expiration-driven markets. Jed Reagan : Gotcha. Thanks. And can you talk a little bit about your expected disposition plans for 2017 in terms of the potential dollar value and the profile of assets you might look to sell? Owen Thomas : I think, Jed, for 2017, we haven\u2019t finalized our disposition plan yet. But our expectation is that we will continue to do what we\u2019ve been doing for the last couple of years and that is selling non-core assets. So I would expect the volume of dispositions to be more in line with what we were doing in 2016 as opposed to a couple years ago. Jed Reagan : I see. Okay. And then just as we look out to 2017 external growth plans, how should we think about the potential number of, or scale \u2013 aggregate scale of new development starts, and I know you mentioned a few D.C. possibilities specifically, if there\u2019s any sense of kind of how much that could aggregate? Douglas Linde : So I will give you a range. If we are able to do nothing other than this potential lease at 145, the number is call it \u2013 what Owen said $530 million. If we are successful in generating the business that Ray is chasing in DC, there\u2019s another $0.5 billion of potential starts in calendar year 2017. Jed Reagan : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc. Craig Mailman : Thank you, guys. Maybe to ask the kind of out-year NOI question a different way. As you guys kind of look at the portfolio and look at what your expirations are going to be two years out, are there any kind of instances similar to what we are seeing today with 601 Lex and other places, where big blocks of space may be taken offline to redevelop kind of anything that could be a step back in terms of an offset to some of the NOI coming on? Owen Thomas : So it\u2019s a very fair question, Craig. And I think that if we go around our portfolio and look at the amount of repositioning we have already done, the vast majority has been completed. There are a few 300,000 plus square foot buildings in Washington D.C. One of them is undergoing a renovation right now and the other one will likely start in 2019 or 2020. That\u2019s the building over on New Hampshire Avenue, right? Douglas Linde : Yes. Owen Thomas : And then there\u2019s a suburban office building in Boston that we actually are under \u2013 about to undergo a renovation on, but we actually got a \u2013 we have a signed lease for that building and that tenant would like to be, sorry, not a signed lease, a signed letter of intent and that tenant would like to be in that space in the third quarter of 2017, so that one is going to happen really fast. Our CBD portfolio by and large in New York City and in Boston and in Washington D.C. aside from that one building I just described have really gone through a pretty significant restoration and refurbishment. And then we are going to be doing some work at Embarcadero Center probably over the next two or three years to really upgrade and improve the experiences there. But not in anticipation of any lease expirations just in the form of making sure we are maintaining our competitiveness with the marketplace. Craig Mailman : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just to go back, Owen, to your comments about kind of the opportunities you are seeing in D.C. on the development side. I mean, could you kind of go into \u2013 is that more in the District, more in the kind of Metro more broadly and how comfortable would you be doing any development other than the build-to-suit in that market? Owen Thomas : We are looking at opportunities in the District, in Northern Virginia and in suburban Maryland. And certainly as we have described, pre-leasing is critical for us to launch projects and even more critical if we are going to do it in the suburbs. If we have a development that is fully or materially pre-leased at an attractive yield, it\u2019s something we are certainly going to launch. Craig Mailman : So something like north of 50% kind of a good bogey? Owen Thomas : Oh, yes. Douglas Linde : Craig, just to give you clear perspective. Three of the things we are looking at in D.C are 100% leased and one of them there will likely be a lease of at least 60% or 70%. Craig Mailman : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just one last quick one, you guys are seeing the demand come back for the space you have at the GM building. Is there \u2013 could you just give some color on maybe is it a similar tenancy to what you guys had on the hook earlier? Did you guys have to change pricing there at all to reignite activity? Douglas Linde : We have not changed our pricing from the deals that we were doing a year ago. So we have not raised our pricing, but we haven\u2019t lowered our pricing and the tenants are very similar. They are in what I guess Owen refers to as small financial firms, private equity firms, alternative asset management firms, consultants to the asset management business, some, quote unquote, I guess hedge funds self provide. John Powers : We call them very attractive tenants. Michael LaBelle : Doug, I think the only difference might be that we thought we might have to have pre-built some of the space and try to attract 5,000 to 10,000 square foot users. And as Doug described, what we are really talking to is 20,000 to 40,000 square foot users. So that\u2019s a half a floor to a full floor, so that\u2019s not really doing kind of the pre-built activity. Douglas Linde : But we will end up doing some pre-building on those floors to fill out the space. Craig Mailman : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes form the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Thank you. Just on that subject of retail in New York. I was interested in Doug\u2019s comments on the conservative percentage rents that you see there. Can you just give us a range of what conservative means and also was that commentary for Under Armour or did that include Apple as well? Douglas Linde : So you are never going to hear us describing what the rent is or what the sales are for any of our tenants on a particular basis, because I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s appropriate. So the number I gave you was a revenue base for all of the retail at the building, which includes a multitude of tenants, even some banks, but they don\u2019t give us percentage rent. [Multiple Speakers]. Yes, right. And so my point \u2013 I guess my point is is that we are well off what the peak sales were in terms of our expectations for the percentage rent and we haven\u2019t assumed any growth. So we said let\u2019s look at what the least exciting sales might be and use that as our baseline and everything that we get on top of that will be gravy. John Kim : But as far as conservative, are you saying below 20%? Douglas Linde : I\u2019m not going to give you a number, because you\u2019ve got to understand the sales for these properties are different than they are for anything else that you would probably see in a retail portfolio. John Kim : Okay. In San Francisco, there has been a lot of media reports on the structural integrity of Millennium Tower, which neighbors Salesforce Tower. How concerned are you about this and has this impacted leasing at all? Douglas Linde : Bob, would you like to describe that one? Robert Pester : It\u2019s had zero impact on leasing and we are not worried about the building falling over. That\u2019s the short answer. John Kim : In a worst-case scenario, what do you think happens? Robert Pester : I think they pressure grout and stop the building from sinking. I think it\u2019s going to continue to sink until they come up with a solution. John Kim : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel. John Guinee : Thank you. Big picture question for you guys. The \u2013 over the last 10 years, you have been highly, highly successful selling high 4% cap rates plus or minus developing to a 7% yield. Your cost of capital on an NOI basis has been a $4.5 to 5% yield. You\u2019ve paid a special dividend when necessary. And what this has done? Is this has really helped you on an NAV value creation, but has hurt in terms of FFO growth? If you look at what\u2019s happening in the investment sale market, as I think, Owen, you pointed out at the beginning, some stunningly high prices, but very few bidders. Why aren\u2019t you taking advantage of this and really ramping up your investment sale program, given what can be happening in the market in the next couple years in the investment sale arena? Owen Thomas : John, well, we have taken advantage of the sale market this cycle. We did several billion dollars worth of asset sales and joint ventures over the last several years and made significant special dividends to shareholders. We also \u2013 a lot of those decisions also were driven by the need we had for capital to fund our development pipeline, in which we\u2019ve been employing. We will certainly consider selling additional assets in the future if we need the capital for a new investment that we make or for additional development. But what we are not doing is just selling assets when we don\u2019t have a need for capital. As you know, our debt is lower than where it has traditionally been and we have still substantial capital to invest in our current development pipeline. John Guinee : Great. Thank you. A - Owen Thomas : Okay. That concludes all the questions and our remarks. Thank you for your attention. That concludes the call. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks. Owen Thomas : Thank you, Arista and good morning everyone. Starting with current results, we just completed an outstanding quarter on virtually all metrics. Our FFO per share for the quarter was $0.04 above our prior forecast and street consensus, and we increase the mid-point of our full year 2017 guidance by $0.04 as well. We leased 3 million square-feet in the fourth quarter, which is an all time quarterly record in Boston Properties' history. For all of 2016, we leased 6.4 million square-feet, which is approximately 22% above our long-term annual averages. The most of this leasing will have a positive impact in future quarters, our in service portfolio occupancy is now 90.2%, which is up 60 basis points from the end of the third quarter. We had another quarter of positive rent roll-ups in our leasing activity with rental rates on leases that commenced in the fourth quarter, up 25% on a gross basis and 39% on a net basis compared to the prior lease. Also in the quarter, we announced several large scale new business wins, including the development of new corporate headquarters for both Akamai and Marriott and control of an important site on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington DC. And to cap it all off, we announced an increase in our regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 or 15%. Let's move to the economic environment, U.S. economic growth continues to be positive, but sluggish. And as you know, recently released initial fourth quarter GDP growth estimates were 1.9%, which brought full year 2016 economic growth to 1.6%. The employment picture continues to improve gradually, 156,000 jobs were created in December and the unemployment rates flat at 4.7%. Though, there has been much written about the positive economic impact of the recent election outcome due to the prospects of increased fiscal spending and general regulatory relaxation, we think it's too early to underwrite such optimism and are taking a wait and see approach. In the capital markets, the 10 year U.S. treasury has risen, approximately 90 basis points to 2.5% since the end of the third quarter. We anticipate the Fed raising rates more frequently in 2017 with some prospect of further acceleration given the strengthening job picture and possibility of fiscal stimulus. Rate rises will be a headwind for the economy given the upper pressure on the dollar and result negative impact on net exports as we saw in the fourth quarter GDP figures. Given the growth in the U.S. economy, the office markets where we operate remain healthy. In the CBDs of our four core markets and West LA, net absorption was 1.7 million square-feet for the fourth quarter. And additions to supply were around 0.25 million square-feet. And as a result, the vacancy rate dropped from 8.3% to 8.1%. Acting rents rose approximately 1.6% year-over-year and aggregate construction levels are approximately 3.7% of stock versus an annual historical delivery rate of 2.7%. Now much has been speculated about a quote Trump bumped to office markets in Washington DC due to increased government activity, and New York City due to financial deregulation. While we see financial tenants more confident as a result of the strong stock market in the fourth quarter and legal and lobbing activity has increased in Washington DC, we believe it is too early to expect to experience broad positive leasing activity as a result of the speculated plans of the executive branching Congress. In the pride of real-estate market, aggregate transaction volumes were modestly lower in 2016 versus 2015. This was driven by fewer assets in the market and a slowdown in transaction activity after the election as interest rates rose sharply. We continue to believe there's a strong bid for high quality office assets in our core markets as several transactions were completed above replacement costs over the last quarter. Examples are, starting in Cambridge 1 Kendall Square, which is a 655,000 square-foot office and retail complex, sold to a domestic REIT for $1,125 a square-foot and a low 4% cap rate, and that includes value allocated at market value to a related development parcel. In Washington DC, our partner sold its 70% interest in 500 North Capital, a 231,000 square-feet office building located in the capital district, for just under a $1000 a square foot, a mid fourth cap rate to an offshore high net worth investor. In the Soma district of San Francisco, Foundry 3, a 291,000 square-foot office building sold for $1200 a square foot and a 4.7 cap rate to a U.S. pension advisor. And lastly in, LA 2700 Colorado, which is a 311,000 square-foot office building located essentially directly across the street from our own Colorado center, sold for $1165 a square foot to a corporate user. Several large asset sales are currently in the market and offshore investors remain active, and we think aggressive. One final note on the environment, there's also been much speculation on changes to the tax code initiated by the new President in Congress. Changes which could impact Boston Properties would be a corporate tax decrease, elimination of tax free exchanges, elimination of the deductibility of interest expense and full expensing of capital cost. While a corporate tax decrease would be beneficial to our customers and the other changes could impact our capital strategy, and we are analyzing various scenarios. We think it's again too early to determine the exact provisions of potential tax reform. So in summary, though, we're long into an economic recovery by any measure relative to history, we're not overly concerned about a near-term recession, given currently low interest rates and the prospects for fiscal stimulus and tax reforms. We're continuing to execute the capital strategy we've been employing over the last few years, which entails growth through aggressive leasing, selective development of pre-leased projects and target acquisitions of under-leased assets. We will protect the downside by keeping leverage at low levels and financing developments through asset sales and additional debt capacity from our increasing NOI. Now, let me move to the execution of our capital strategy, and I'll start with acquisitions. Our Washington DC team has two important new business wins this past quarter. First, we were selected as the developer by George Washington University for a site at 2100, Pennsylvania Avenue in close proximity to our very successful 2200, Pennsylvania Avenue project. Subject to securing 480,000 square-feet of entitlements, we'll enter into a long term ground-lease with George Washington University to develop and own a lease-hold interest in the property. This is one of the most attractive development sites in the Washington DC CBD, and we have substantial pre-leasing interest for the project. Entitlements could be completed and development commence in 2019 for a 2022 delivery. Next, upon conclusion of a highly competitive process we were honored to be awarded the opportunity to develop and own 50% of Marriott's new headquarters development in downtown Bethesda, Maryland in partnership with the local land-owner. The building will be 720,000 square-feet, and subject to entitlements and finalizing a lease agreement, the project will commence in 2018 and be delivered in 2022. At North Station, you recall we're in the middle of constructing a 385,000 square-foot mixed used building, which will also serve as a podium for separate residential hotel and office towers. This past quarter, we signed a long-term ground lease for the hotel parcel with who will be responsible for funding 100% of the improvements. We anticipate commencing the hotel and residential projects in late 2018, and will await a substantial prelease to commence the office joint venture. On dispositions, there were no new transactions last quarter. For all of 2016, we completed three deals for total gross proceeds to Boston Properties of $235 million in line with projections provided at the beginning of the year. For 2017, we anticipate continuing the selective disposition of non-core assets with projected total gross proceeds in excess of $200 million. Moving to development, we remain active, delivering assets in the service advancing our predevelopment pipeline and evaluating new investments. This past quarter, we delivered in the service 1265 Main Street, headquarters for Clarks in suburban Boston, which I described in detail last quarter. In terms of starts for the fourth quarter, in the Boston region, we've commenced the full redevelopment of 191 Spring Street, a 160,000 square-foot vacant building in Lexington and a new retail amenity building on the Plaza outside of 100 Federal Street. Our total investments in these projects in $85 million, and both are further examples of opportunities we have in our portfolio to profitability reposition assets and create additional amenities for our customers. We remain active advancing our predevelopment pipeline for projects that would start after 2016. Several updates from the third quarter include, we signed a letter of intent with our land partner for MacArthur Transit Village, which is a 402 unit residential project located in Oakland, California; whereupon full entitlement of the site, we have the right to develop and invest in the project on favorable term. This development would commence in 2018 and deliver in 2020. We also received site plan approval for the development of Akamai\u2019s 475,000 square-foot headquarters at Kendall Center in Cambridge. This project will start this year, and be delivered in 2020. At the end of the fourth quarter, our development pipeline consists of seven new projects and three redevelopments, totaling 4 million square-feet and $2.3 billion of projected cost. Our projected cash NOI yield for these developments is in excess of 7% with material preleasing. In the aggregate, these projects are a significant growth driver for us over the next three years. So, to conclude, we continue to remain very enthusiastic about our prospects for growth and creating shareholder value in the quarters and years ahead. In our third quarter investor materials, we provided a roadmap to shareholders of our clear and achievable plan to increase our NOI by 20% to 25% by the year 2020, by delivering our current development pipeline on-time and budget and leasing up our existing assets from approximately 90% to 93%. And this growth profile excludes most of the new business wins I described earlier; the opportunity supported by our significant land banks and new opportunities that could be identified and executed upon, given our conservative leverage and strong balance sheet. So with that, let me turn it over to Doug. Doug Linde : Thanks, Owen. Good morning everybody, Happy New Year. Consistent with Owen's remarks on the performance of the overall U.S. economy, as we begin 2017, I think about our own projections for the year where our view is that the overall health of the office markets really isn\u2019t going to change too much from what we experienced over the last 12 months. We continue to see the bulk of office demand growth from the technology and the life sciences businesses, and pretty steady as we go from financial services and other traditional users. While, there is no question that venture capital investing slowed across industry types and regions in '16, there was still $70 billion invested, which is more than double what was invested in 2006 to put in perspective. And interestingly, there was more capital raise by the DC sponsors in '16 and in any year since 2006. So, there is a lot of money sitting on the side lines waiting to be invested. Demand from traditional office tenants and legal and the large financial services, has stabilized. While there are still sporadic space reductions stemming from changes in utilization and some downsizing, we have begun to see pockets of growth from these tenants in New York, and in San Francisco and in Boston. For instance, the new lease that was signed by Point72 who is currently in our building at 510 Madison with 2022 lease expiration is significantly larger when they moved to the Hudson Yard. In our portfolio we had 40,000 square foot hedge fund extend by more than 50% in our New York City portfolio. Accenture, which is tenant in Boston, is going to move into 888 Boylston Street and they are going to expand by more than almost 50% later this year. We have 45,000 square-feet private equity firm at the Prudential Center, and expanded by 10,000 square-feet. So, lots of examples of traditional tenants starting to feel better about their business and moving forward. New supply, however, has been delivered in all of our markets and along with the organic supply from the more efficient use of space at the last number of years, It still continues to impact the markets, particularly older buildings that don\u2019t want to reinvest new capital. Before describe the various market dynamics, I do want to reiterate the phenomenal quarter our teams produced from an operating perspective. 3 million square-feet of leasing is a big deal. We completed 112 transactions, typical quarter about 80, so that\u2019s about 40% more. And actively Akamai lease of 4 76,000 square-feet, the next largest transaction was only 200,000 square feet. Our same store results were positive across all the regions. On a net basis, San Francisco was up 76%, Boston was up 24%, the New York City office portfolio was up 14%, and DC was up a little less than 1%. Our operating platform continues to be, if not are, probably the critical strategic differentiator for this organization. I\u2019ll start my regional comments with San Francisco. Last quarter and at the NAREIT Conference in November, we were responded to questions about sublet space and the resiliency of the technology tenant demand. There is no question that sublet space interfered with direct space leasing in '16. But as I described on our last call, each major block was quickly leased. Currently, the largest block of sublet space is about 80,000 square-feet, and there are only three pieces of space in access of 50,000 square-feet available on the sublet market and their average termites under two years. The majority of the sublet space in San Francisco is in units under 20,000 square-feet. And with regard to technology demand, just during the fourth quarter; Twitch, which is an Amazon subsidiary, completed 185,000 square foot lease at 350 Bush; Adobe is up 200,000 square-feet; Slack announced their 230,000 square-feet lease at 500 Howard. And by the way, they were an 11,000 square-feet tenant at 680 Fulsome Street our buildings two years ago. And last month a start-up called Blend took 50,000 square-feet at 500 Prime. On Friday, however, there was yet another article in the San Francisco Media, noting with concern that the near-term deliveries, including Salesforce Tower are an issue and how they might impact the market. While we can tell you, we signed 40,000 square-feet of leases in December, and we are completing the drafting of 100,000 square foot, four-floor lease that we expect to execute in the next few weeks with a tenant that needs late 2017 occupancy. With this commitment, we will have leased almost 1 million square feet at Salesforce Tower. This will bring us to 68% leased with 450,000 square-feet of availability. Tour activity is consistently strong, and we have begun marketing to partial floor users with occupancies as early as the fourth quarter of 2017. When we talk to the brokers\u2019 community about their tenants in the market left, which they all maintain, there continue to be a number of 200,000 square foot prospects tech and traditional active in the San Francisco CBD market. At the moment, there aren't any blockbuster requirements those 500,000 square footers that we saw in '14 and '15, which is very similar to this experience we saw last year. But the overall market conditions, we've been describing for the last few quarters, remain the same. Each quarter there continues to be a new crop of technology company requirements in addition to the traditional lease expiration driven market. We think the real news in San Francisco is simply the stability of the markets. In West LA, we signed leases for more than 200,000 of our 350,000 square-feet of office availability at Colorado Center. And we extended another 190,000 square foot tenant. We have a number of discussions ongoing on the two final pieces of the base, one 40,000 and the other one's about 70,000. The purchase of 2700 Colorado by Oracle and their expected growth in that building has accelerated the tightening of the market in the immediate sub-area. Amazon, Snap, Oracle, Rightgames and Hulu all expanded in the sub-market during the quarter. We've completed the initial planning for our upgrade of the common areas, and we are moving into the execution phase on that plan. I want to start my discussion in the New York City region with the General Motors\u2019 building where we've been very successful marketing the floors that we got back last July, the 33rd and 34th floors, we're asking above $170 a square foot in rent. We've leased 23,000 square-feet, have a lease-out for 40,000 square-feet and there\u2019re exchange proposals for the remaining prebuilt suite. During this process, we found a number of tenants that want to be in the building but would prefer a lower price alternative, which we could provide lower in the building if we had available space. With that in mind, we've agreed to take back two lower floors from an existing tenant. That tenant lease expiration is in late 2020, and we reached an agreement to terminate the lease in exchange for a significant payment. While we are taking some risk on the lease-up, we feel confident we will lease the space at rents comparable to the expiring rent and have reduced our 2020 exposure at the building. We have also concluded all the leasing on the retail space on 5th Avenue with an expansion and extension with Apple, that mystery tenant we've been talking about for over a year. They will grow from 32,000 square-feet to more than 77,000 square-feet. And while they are undertaking their expansion, they are using the former FAO Schwarz lease on a temporary basis. This interim store is open, and they expect to reoccupy the renovated space in late '18 at which time we will deliver this interim store to Under Armor for their full build-out. The conditions we've been describing for the last few years in New York City still remain in control. We are not anticipating office run growth and we do expect higher concessions versus 2016 across midtown in '17. New supply continues to come into the market in the form of new deliveries and large blocks of space return to the market in buildings like 4 Times Square and 65 East 55th, or 1271 6th Avenue and soon 399 Park Avenue impact the market. Landlords that are putting capital into all their assets are attracting tenants, Major League Baseball went over to 1271 6th Avenue, and space that is attractively priced is also getting activity. In the latter part of '16, 270,000 square-feet of space was leased to three tenants at the base to 4 Times Square, the space Conde Nast moved out when they moved down to the World Trade Center. Our total New York regional office leasing activity in the fourth quarter was about 400,000 square feet. In addition to the lease at the General Motor's building, we completed two full floor deals at 599 Lexington Avenue and 240,000 square-feet at Carnegie Center. We\u2019re starting rents of between $32 and $35 a square foot, and TIs are running between $0 and $6 per square foot per year. 159 East 53rd Street is under demolition and we've had lots of tour activity as the building has never been on the tenant reps radar since it's been occupied by Citi Bank since the building opened in the late 70s -- early 70s. We are marketing a brand new building with a greatly enhanced window line, brand new mechanical plan and tremendous outdoor space on each floor. We hope to deliver this 195,000 square-feet block to tenants in 2018 with revenue commencing in 2019. At 399 Park, our repositioning activities are accelerating, and we are offering products at various pricing levels from the mid-80s at the base to over $140 a square foot for our Oasis glass block with its 13 foot finish ceiling height on the 14th floor.  The DC Central Business District office market fundamentals really haven't seen any demonstrative positive change since election. In fact, one of the recent executive orders putting a higher increase on significant portions of the federal government is probably unlikely to spur new GSA requirements. Landlords are still competing pretty seriously on available space and congestions in the DC are pretty strong, 10 years or more leases are getting 12 months of free rent and at least $100 square foot of tenant improvement allowances. DC is truly a forward leasing market for any sizeable space, and we're in active discussions with our new opportunity at 2100 Penn as Owen mentioned. With the right products and the right locations, you can break away from the commodity leasing market and make a lot of money in D.C. There continues to be specula buildings under construction, ageing buildings are being repositioned and there're still lots of buildings with over 100,000 square-feet of space, but again you can still make money in DC. This quarter, our most significant DC lease was 10 year renewal with the GSA at 500 East Street for over 200,000 square-feet. The one area in the DC region where we've seen the potential for pick-up in activity is around the defense and the intelligent users in Northern Virginia. Activity at our VA 95 single storey product, which is adjacent to Fort Boulevard has accelerated significantly, and we're on lease negotiations with two tenants one for 53,000 square feet and the other for 69,000 square feet. And finally, I want to describe the pending development in Bethesda. Marriott is leasing 100% of the office space we're not involved in the hotel that\u2019s also part of that development. And when the building is completed in 2022, the building will be 100% leased. It's premature however to discuss any of the financial details. So, if you ask any questions, you're not going to get a very satisfactory answer from us this quarter. In Boston, as Owen reported, we completed our lease with Akamai on the site of our existing 79,000 square foot 145 Broadway building. With the recent news of MIT's acquisition of the Volpe site for $750 million, I think it's fair to say that the new Akamai lease that we signed this quarter is already well below market. Our Cambridge portfolio was 98% leased. A few quarters ago, I described the possible opportunity to recapture the Microsoft base at 455 Main Street. This Microsoft consolidated into an adjacent building in Cambridge. Well, it happened and we\u2019re getting 100,000 square-feet back on December 31st of this year and the current rent is $50 gross. Across the river in the Backbay, we had a very active quarter. We leased 64,000 square-feet at 888, Boylston Street, bringing the office building to 89% leased. We leased 200,000 square-feet at the Prudential Center. We did 55,000 square-feet at 120 St. James, and 33,000 square-feet at 200 Clarendon. Activity at 120 St. James is robust, and we are in lease negotiations on the majority of an additional floor, and have four active letter of intent negotiations ongoing right now for the remaining space. We\u2019ve introduced our plans to create high-end pre-build sweets at 200 Clarendon, and have seen a meaningful pick-up and interest on that space as well. While the Boston CBD continues to be predominantly a lease expiration driven market, during the steady flow of new market entrance as well as some growing technology companies. This quarter Reebok announced the decision to move into the city, and the interest we are seeing for the 175,000 square-feet of office base at the first space of the hub, which is under construction, and will be delivered by the second quarter of 2019 has exceeded our expectations. The pace of activity in our suburban portfolio was equally strong during the fourth quarter. We completed more than 300,000 square-feet of leasing, including adding another life science firm to the portfolio with 46,000 square-foot lease at 140 Kender Street, which brings that building to 100% leased. We commenced the redevelopment of 191 Spring Street and are in negotiation for an 80,000 square-foot lease tenant, which we expect to have in place before the end of the fourth quarter of '17. High quality space is at a premium in the Boston suburbs. So, going back to our bridges, in November, we published a slide-deck which included an update on how to think about our growth over the next 36 months, which is what Owen was describing. The first slide illustrated the incremental share of NOI, we believe we could achieve through an increase in occupancy from our high contribution buildings. The total incremental contribution was projected to be about $111 million. To-date, we\u2019ve signed leases where we have not yet began recognizing revenue totaling $56 million, and about $22 million of that will start to hit the books in 2017. The second slide illustrated the map of a ramp-up of our income from our development investments. We showed meaningful additions to our lease-up of these assets this quarter, including the 475,000 square-foot pre-leased of Akamai, 64,000 square-feet at 888 Boylston Street, 40,000 at Salesforce with that other 100,000 square-feet coming on in the very near future. We are progressing on completing the leasing of our development assets necessary to generate the incremental run-rate of $234 million of NOI annually by the beginning of 2020. And with that, I\u2019ll let Mike talk about this quarter. Mike LaBelle : Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning. I am going to start with a few comments on capital raising this morning. As Owen described, we have strong opportunities to continue to expand our development pipeline, and we\u2019ve active in the capital markets, considering funding options for that. As we\u2019ve discussed before, with our relatively low leverage, particularly if you calculated on a pro forma basis for the delivery of our developments, we do not anticipate raising public equity. And we expect to focus our capital raising activities on the debt markets and moderate asset sales. This quarter, we raised an incremental $200 million. This included the closing of $250 million construction loan from a consortium of banks for our Brooklyn Navy Yard development and $40 million 15 year mortgage on our recently delivered new development at 1265 Main Street in Waltham. We own 50% of each of these projects, so our share of the proceeds will be $145 million. We also closed on the partial sale of Metropolitan Square in Washington DC where we\u2019ve reduced our interest from 51% to 20%, and raised net proceeds of $58 million. Our current pipeline has approximately $1 billion to fund through the end of 2019. And in addition to using our available cash balances, we expect to be active in the debt markets in 2017 raising additional capital. Our earnings guidance assumes that we utilize our untapped line of credit to fund the incremental development cost. But it is likely that we put in place additional debt facilities during the year, which could increase our interest expense guidance depending on timing. So, turning to our earnings for the quarter, we had a strong quarter, and we exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range for FFO by $0.04 per share or about $7 million. The portfolio beat expectations by about $4 million of this through a combination of earlier than projected leasing wins and lower than anticipated utility acceptance. As both Doug and Owen described, we had a strong quarter of leasing, including early renewal activity that had rental rate increases in suburban Boston, at Colorado Center, in West LA, and at Embarcadero Center in San Francisco that increased our revenue for the quarter. We also earned about $4 million higher fee income than we expected for the quarter. A portion of this emanated from higher utilization of services across the portfolio that included a substantial amount of overtime HVACs in New York City, which demonstrated growing economic activity at our clients there. We also generated nearly $2 million in leasing commissions at a property that we manage on a fee basis. As Owen mentioned this quarter, we closed a long-term Air Rights lease with a hotel operator who is going to build 270-room hotel at our hub on Causeway development in Boston. We will provide development and management services to the project over the next three years, and we commenced earning development fees this quarter, which was a little bit earlier than we projected. And lastly, we incurred $1.2 million of debt deal related expenses that we had not budgeted, which partially offset the gains from fee income in the portfolio. Our FFO run rate from third quarter to fourth quarter is up significantly by $0.12 a share. About $0.05 of this is from seasonality and our operating expenses and above normal fee income, but a substantial portion relates to growth in our revenue base, as well as well as lower interest expense from the refinancing activity that we completed in the third quarter. Our revenue run rate is higher by about $0.05 per share from increases in occupancy and rolling-up of rents on leasing activity with strong contributions at the Prudential Center in Boston, our suburban Boston portfolio and Embarcadero Center. As we look forward to 2017, we have increased our guidance for 2017 funds from operations by $0.04 per share at the midpoint from last quarter. A strong fourth quarter leasing success includes a number of new leases and renewals that will start to enhance our revenues in 2017. The deal activity in Boston, Los Angeles, and San Francisco will have the most significant impact. And in Boston, this includes significant leases at Prudential Tower at 120 St. James, Kendall Center and multiple leases in our Waltham portfolio. We're continuing to see strong activity on the remaining 115,000 square-feet of availability that we have at 120 St. James where we could see incremental income in 2017, and certainly by 2018. The leasing of the 190,000 square-feet of high value availability in the mid and high rise at 200 Clarendon Street is unlikely to generate significant revenue until 2018. The successful leasing of over 400,000 square-feet of new and renewal leases that Doug described at Colorado Center is also resulting in growth in our 2017 revenue. We have 150,000 square-feet of remaining vacancy where we project modest revenue towards the end of 2017 and more meaningful contribution in 2018. The leasing in the New York City portfolio was mostly renewal activity, and new leases geared towards 2018 rent commencements. As Doug mentioned, we entered into a termination with a 75,000 square-foot tenant in the GM building. This transaction results in approximately $0.03 per share of additional income in 2017, which is the net impact of our share of the termination payment, offset by the loss of cash rent for the remainder of 2017. We will be reclassifying recurring income to termination income, which moves it out of our same property projections. With the pickup in portfolio leasing elsewhere, we are not changing our assumptions for growth in our share of combined 2017 same property NOI of 2% to 3.5% from last year. However, for cash same property NOI, we are moderating our assumptions for growth by 50 basis points to 1.5% to 3.5%. We project temporarily losing cash income at the GM building, while gaining straight-line rent across the portfolio from new leases that have free rent periods at inception. Our projections now assume non-cash straight-line rent of $55 million to $80 million in 2017. This quarter, we added the 191 Spring Street redevelopment to our development pipeline, the 160,000 square-foot building in suburban Boston will undergo $53 million renovation, including leasing costs. The project also includes approximately $3 million of demolition costs that we expect to expense in 2017. To account for these expenses, we've reduced our projections for the contribution from the non-same property portfolio to $18 million to $25 million. The only other meaningful change to our 2017 guidance this quarter is related to development and management services income where we increased our guidance range from $27 million to $33 million. In conclusion, we're increasing our 2017 projected FFO guidance range to $6.13 to $6.23 per share, an increase of $0.04 per share at the midpoint. The increase is projected to be driven by $0.03 per share from the net impact of lease termination, $0.02 per share of improved portfolio performance and $0.02 per share from fee income, offset by $0.02 per share of higher demolition expenses and $0.01 per share of higher G&A expense. Our 2016 results includes $58 million or $0.34 per share of termination income. This is much higher than our current assumption for 2017 of $16 million to $18 million. Adjusting for the impact of the change in termination income from year-to-year, we're projecting strong FFO growth of nearly 8% in 2017. And as a result of our growth from our 2016 performance, we also increased our dividend in the fourth quarter by over 15% to an annual rate of $3 per share. That completes our formal remarks. Operator if you want to open the line for questions if you can? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi. Manny Korchman : Doug, question for you. You went through -- the market as we typically do, the one question I have walking away from that is if you took DC specifically as a market, how do you feel about DC, especially CBD today versus a year ago, because I couldn\u2019t kind of place where your mood was on that? Owen Thomas : I\u2019ll give you my reaction, and then I\u2019ll let Ray give his comments. My view is nothing has changed in DC proper. We\u2019ve seen a market that is forward in terms of its leasing, and there are basically very few large transactions that are going to hit in 2017, '18 or '19 that are impacting those years in terms of rental rates. So all the leasing is forward. And so, if you have a block of available space today, it's going to be hand-to-hand combat, as Ray like to say in terms of getting that lease that\u2019s basically. And there is new suppliers coming online, and there are tenants in significant -- or landlords that are significantly improving their quote-on-quote edging beauties with new capital. So, it's a very competitive market for second generation space, and there is not a lot of new demand generators in the district itself. Ray, I don\u2019t know if you have any other thoughts. Ray Ritchey : Well, this will come as a shock, but I have a little more optimistic viewpoint to Doug. I would agree with Doug. The market is bifurcated between the traditional as we call edging beauties the buildings that have been that represent the A Class buildings for many, many years, but has being a little bit more challenged. But it is amazing to us, the demand for high level, trophy level space, new construction and thus showing the success we had 61 Mass and the interest we\u2019re receiving at 2100 Penn. We\u2019ve had control of the property now for two or three months, and we\u2019ve got three or four major law firms that we\u2019re in active discussions in. Even though that occupancy will take place in '21 and '22. So it's a very, very differentiated market, high-end trophy space, as strong as ever. The space has been kind of bypass because of new technology, new configuration and new locations, is facing some challenges. But we are still very, very optimistic. We think the law firm consolidation has been running at full course. There is one dynamic of the Trump is we\u2019re seeing a lot of associations, corporations, others engaging law firm and lobbies to understand what the Trump dynamic will mean. So, we are seeing -- and as Doug referred in the call, we\u2019re seeing an uptick just in the last month or so in the defense and intelligence related community demand. So, one maybe view the glass half full, I view as the glass almost due to the top. We\u2019re feeling very good about the upper in space. Owen Thomas : So, Manny, I actually think our comments are pretty consistent. So, when we referred to 2100 Penn you talking about leases that are commenced in 2022. It's a forward leasing market, and we\u2019re very encouraged about how we\u2019ll do at 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue. But we have available space in '17, '18, '19, you\u2019re going to struggle. Manny Korchman : And maybe just second from me, was there anything specific driving the large leasing volumes in the fourth quarter that will slow with just a lot of walking tackling, What's the favorite going forward on just leasing volumes looking at the first half of '17 specifically? Ray Ritchey : Let me say one thing and then I\u2019ll let Owen comment. There was not one deal that was done during that period that was originated during the fourth quarter. So, everything is ongoing. And I would say that to the extent that things were getting done it was because it was the end of the year and people want to get paid on the brokerage side. And there's an emphasis on getting deals completed. I would also say that there was more confidence in the business community after the results of the election, and that probably you know pushed things further along quicker than they might otherwise have been. Owen Thomas : No, I think that's all right. There were a -- like the Akamai was a lumpy lease, obviously. As much as I\u2019d love to think $3 million would be a run rate quarterly leasing volume for us, that's not going to be the case. It was an extraordinary quarter, and there were some special circumstances, but the markets remained healthy. And I think the other thing that happened is I'm very proud and pleased with our leasing professionals around the Company. I think they very much focused on our goals for the year, and performed accordingly. So, starting with the combination of all these factors a healthy market, some lumpy leases and focused execution by our team. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors. Jed Reagan : You guys had a pretty good pick-up in occupancy, and you're now back over 90% portfolio-wide, as you talked about. Do you guys track that on a percent lease basis, if you include leases that haven't, that have been signed but not commenced? I am just trying to get a feel for how that number might be trending following the really good quarter of leasing? Michael LaBelle : We don't -- we can figure out the numbers we have. We can look at and we know specific situations where we have you know large tenants, for example, at 250, West 51st Street. We have an 85,000 square foot tenant that hasn't taken occupancy yet. We have 25,000 square foot tenant at GM building that hasn't taken occupancy yet. We have some tenants across the portfolio where we think about distinct situations where we can look at it. We've not aggregated that and looked at it on a forward basis. We do obviously look at what our occupancy is going to be over the next couple of years. And our view for this year is that we\u2019re still going to average between 90 and 91%. Our occupancy should go up in the first couple of quarters. And then at the end of the year, we\u2019re going to lose occupancy at 399 Park Avenue in New York City, which is going to bring it back down a little bit. And as Doug described in his notes and what we\u2019ve disclosed in our investor presentations are that, look, we've got some vacancy in some buildings like 200, Clarendon Street, Colorado Center, 601 Lex, where we believe we're going to fill these spaces up. We're highly confident we're going to fill these spaces up over the next couple of years, and move our occupancy up into the 93% area. Jed Reagan : And just I guess sticking with you, Mike, you mentioned some of the debt activities you're exploring as you\u2019re looking to fund development. Just order of magnitude, curious how much incremental debt you might be looking to issue this year. And where you think your debt to EBITDA might finish the year versus where we're sitting today? Michael LaBelle : On a net debt to EBITDA basis, I would say that we still believe that we\u2019re going to be kind of ranging somewhere to the low 6s to 7s. And then when the income starts coming in as we deliver developments, it's going to come down. The capital that we're going to be raising, if you look at the outflows, we've got $1 billion worth of outflows over the next couple of years. I would anticipate, in 2017, we're going to need to raise somewhere in the $500 million to $700 million area to fund what's happening in 2017. Fund the development outflows that we've going something in that zip code. Owen Thomas : And Jed, I think the way to think about it is, if you think about our development outflows, as Mike described, that's the money that we're going to spend, we will probably raise more than that. A lot of it will be in the form of either term loans that can be drawn down upon or our line of credit, enhancing it in terms of size. So a lot of the capacity may not actually be dollars that are sitting on our balance sheet, they just maybe availability of dollars that we have. Jed Reagan : And just to clarify Mike, you mentioned the low 6 to 7 range on debt-to-EBITDA. What -- just how does that compare to your spot debt-to-EBITDA at 1231 on your numbers? Michael LaBelle : We\u2019re in the low 6 of that, I believe 6.4 or something like that, I believe. Jed Reagan : Okay. Great, thank you. Michael LaBelle : That's moved up a little bit as the development fundings occur, because we don\u2019t have the cash coming in. So, as you fast forward to the cash income coming in from those developments, it's going to come down significantly. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Alexander Goldfarb : Just a few questions here, first, just in reference to Doug, I think you said flattish leasing market here in New York, and you referenced the demand from more lower floors in the GM building. As you guys look at your availability here in New York, how much of it would you say is in that value sweet spot, call it, whatever $80, $90 under $100 a foot versus how much is in the over $100 foot? Owen Thomas : I'll take it a stab at that and then John Powers you can correct me if you think I'm misstating it. So, the biggest bulk of our quote-on-quote value space defined as you just described it is, 100% of the space at 1590 53rd Street, so that's a 195,000 square feet and probably 200,000 plus square feet of the space at 399, so call it 400,000 square foot and then we have 300,000 plus square feet of space at 399 that would be in excess of that. And we have 50,000 square foot of space at the top of 250 West 55th Street that would be above that number. And these two floors that we're getting back from a tenant at General Motors\u2019 building would still be well in excess of that $90 plus square-foot. John, am I missing anything? John Powers : No, I think that's it, probably half and half. Alexander Goldfarb : So, John, so half is in the sweet spot half is in the elevated numbers, right? John Powers : Well, you say the sweet spot. I think Doug is using your terminologies, under 100 and over a 100. Alexander Goldfarb : So, what would you term -- so how should we think about it when we hear from the brokers that hey it's a competitive market, tenants have a lot of choice. But it sounds like you guys had good activity with certain spots, rent spots in the market? John Powers : Yes, every product is a little different. If you look at 159, that's a very unique offering. It's almost a new building, and it's going to be spectacular, it's got a lot of outdoor space. So, I'd say that is very much in the sweet spot of the market, because that will be priced under $100. But we have space at 399, in the tower there that is sweet spot, and now it's 25,000 foot for the core that's a great building. So although be below that's over a 100, it's not a 150. And so people that are looking for high quality might find that to be their sweet spot. Alexander Goldfarb : And then the second part is you mentioned the need to spend on buildings here in New York, or maybe even in DC to attract the tenants and get the tenants. How do you guys separate out spend that\u2019s basically just necessary to get the tenants to come in versus spend that you\u2019re getting in incremental return on the investment? Michael LaBelle : So, we\u2019ve talked about this before and there are two ways to think about this, Alex. So, the first way to think about this is either investment that we\u2019re making that actually have an incremental NOI contribution. And so, what we do is we think about our buildings and we say if we don\u2019t do anything what can we rent the space for and how long might it take. And if we do something what will be the rent be and how long might it take. And in many cases, we actually think that additional capital is going to both enhance the rent that we\u2019re achieving and reduce the downtime that we\u2019re achieving. There are also incremental investments that we\u2019re making in these buildings. We\u2019re actually achieving additional income. So, as an example at 601 Lexington Avenue, there is a -- that first instance, we think we\u2019re going to achieve 7% to 12% return on our capital, because we\u2019re going to get a significantly higher rent than we would have otherwise gotten have we simply leased the space as is. And we\u2019re also redoing the retail space and we\u2019re going to get incremental revenue on the retail space. But what we said is the return on the retail space really is about for the building. And so will that retail space reinvestment improve our ability to generate higher return, aka higher rents from the rest of the space at 601, and we think that\u2019s in fact the case. And given the amount of the investment, you don\u2019t have to get more than a buck or two in order to have a pretty significant return. So, we\u2019ve got how we think about these things. Now there are other situations where we\u2019re doing a lobby or where we having to replace an edging window system or the elevators need to go from a called to a destination. Those types of improvements are much harder to quantify in terms of a dramatic change in the overall environment of the building and there when I referred to more sort of recurring capital investments that are critical not revenue producing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Doug, I guess, maybe you could talk a little bit about your Brooklyn project, and the demand that you\u2019re seeing for that development? Owen Thomas : John, that one is for you. John Powers : Okay. Well, we\u2019re very excited about the projects. And this is a big days for us, because the first piece of scale went up this morning. So, we\u2019re rolling along. There is no -- the buildings built all above grade, so there is no foundation. So, the building will spectacular. It's got all the amenities of a new building, floor-to-floor heights, et cetera. And we\u2019re working with the Navy Yard and the transportation side. I think it's a little too early for the leasing. We brought it out to the brokerage community, and I think it's going to well receive. Steve Sakwa : I mean, John, can you just maybe talk a little bit about what the tenants were saying? I know transportation is a bit balanced there. So, what are you sort of facing or hearing from them? John Powers : Well, in the -- look, the first part of this is going out to the brokerage community overall. And I think we\u2019ve done that pretty successfully. We have to get closer to the date when the building is done to talk to specific tenants. Steve Sakwa : I guess transitioning maybe to the West-Coast, Doug. Maybe talk a little bit about the search for a senior executive and run that region. And just what are the other opportunities that you\u2019re may be seeing in the marketplace today, because it sounds like you're making good progress on the leasing front of the vacant space. So what other opportunities have you sort of found or uncovered? Owen Thomas : So, Steve it's Owen. We are off to a great start in California. We bought Colorado Center, as you know, last year with 66-67% leased. We've leased I think two-thirds of the vacancy and have good activity on the balance. And we have a comparable sale across the street that's well in excess of the basis that we paid for the building. So, we're in a new market, an important market, we think long-term for the Company and we're in there on a profitable basis. And I think, operationally, the asset has been seamlessly integrated into Boston Properties. And Ray Ritchey has done a wonderful job overseeing the leasing and repositioning of the assets. So, your question is where do we go from here? We are going to hire this year a regional head for Los Angeles. We're conducting an outside search, and we're also considering internal candidates for this spot. So, that'll be an important internal step.  In terms of deals, one of the attractiveness of the West LA market where we intend be active is development is difficult, entitlements are hard to come by, it preserves value. And therefore, it is harder to grow. That being said, I would say we have a bead on, I would say at this point, something like half a dozen different opportunities, some of them are sales of under-leased buildings, some are repositioning of existing assets and some are development. As we said before, we're delighted to be in LA. We're going to grow overtime. We want to be a leading land lord and developer in the market, but we also are pushing pressure on ourselves to do that overnight. We want to continue to do it the way we did with Colorado Center and do it on a profitable basis. And I\u2019m hopeful this year that we'll be able to add at least one other asset to our portfolio. And if we can find something on a basis that makes sense financially for shareholders, we're going to do that. Steve Sakwa : And then just last question, I guess, the new retail has opened at the Prudential Center. Doug, I don't know if this is for you or someone else. So, maybe just talk about how that's performing and then the feeder that\u2019s been maybe for the office and what demand that's been for office tenants into the Backbay? Owen Thomas : Sure .So for those of you who are unfamiliar with what's going on at the Prudential Center. When we built the 88, Boylston Street at the same time, we basically demolished what was the Food Court, reinvented it as a 45,000 square foot Eataly and also added another floor space to a portion of the Prudential Center, which we refer to as the flagship. All of that space is leased, and Under Armor, Eataly, organization called Aritzia, the floor expanded. We've got a whole new roster of tenants. And based upon the foot traffic, particularly in what we referred to as the slower times, the Eataly has really been a very positive revenue enhancer to the Prudential Center, and it\u2019s driving traffic not just from a retail perspective but actually it's been driving traffic from a parking perspective. So we actually have a lot of visitors that are coming to the Prudential Center parking and paying for a couple of hours of parking as well, which is important. We have a couple or more of these types of opportunities in front of us. But I think the relevancy of the Prudential retail is stronger today than it has ever been. It's a place that people want to come, and I think it has generated a buzz amongst the retailers so that other retailers want to be here as well. And so, we're feeling really-really good about our incremental investments there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Blaine Heck : Maybe for Doug, you guys obviously had very healthy rent spreads on the 650,000 square-feet of commenced 2nd gen leases during the quarter, up 25% on a gross basis. But can you talk a little bit about maybe what the spreads look like on the 2nd gen leases executed during the quarter? And what should we expect for rent spreads throughout 2017? Michael LaBelle : I'm going to be honest with you. On 3 million square-feet of space and we didn't calculate the number on the step that was executed this quarter. In general, what we are seeing is that our San Francisco area leases are leases that are less than -- more than five years, generally are somewhere between 40% and 50% on a gross basis, doing upwards of 70% on a net basis. Our rents in New York City typically are up 5% to 7% or flat. And we talked about this before, there're certain buildings, 399 being the best example, where we're basically going to be working hard to maintain the same rent level that we had on a basis prior to their expirations. On the other hand, in a building like General Motors\u2019 building, we were taking space back at $100 plus a square foot and leasing it at a $150 square foot. We're seeing a very significant uptick. So, it's very much depending upon the space. Washington DC we have the -- the fortunate or the unfortunate circumstance of having leases in that market that are going up annually by 3% plus a year. So in general, when a lease rolls over in Washington DC, it's probably at market or slightly above market. And so that's why I think you see, in general, a pretty moderate roll-up or roll-down in Washington DC overtime. And then in Boston, again, I think you're seeing a pretty consistent growth in rents. Anything in Cambridge is probably 100% on a net basis, anything in the Backbay is probably somewhere between 25% and 35% on a net basis, and in the suburbs are between 10% and 15%, because we're generally rolling rents from them, mid-to-high 30s to the low-40s. Blaine Heck : So, just as a follow-up to that, it looks like roughly half of your expirations are in New York in 2017. So is it fair to say we should see that spread moderate as we go through? Michael LaBelle : Yes. As I said, the majority of that expiration in New York City in 2017 is at 399 Park, which I just referred to and it's a pretty flat expiration. I think I said in the past that net-net we're a couple of bucks of square foot on average when we lease all that space up above where we're currently expiring. Blaine Heck : And then Mike a little bit more granular question, it looks like cash same-store NOI and your share is going to boost this quarter from the year-over-year change in straight line ground rent expense. Can you just explain what's going on there, and whether you expect that to continue to be a tailwind going forward? Michael LaBelle : This is an interesting situation actually, so I'm glad you brought it up. At the Backbay Station garage, so we own the garage. We extended the ground lease on that garage when we got the additional rights to develop over Backbay station. And what we did is we agreed to pay $37 million in ground rent, and straight lined it over a 99 year ground lease term. The payments associated with that go out as we improve the station, so as the dollar go out. So in the fourth quarter of 2015, we spent $5 million improving some installation there, and in fourth quarter of '16 we spent very little, so that was a boost to our casting store from '15 to '16. We are dependent upon the budgeting of the MBTA to figure out when these costs are going to out, so they are hard for us to judge. But I would say, over the next two to three years, we could have some lumpy quarters where some of this all the sudden hits. In 2017, we don\u2019t have a significant amount of expectation, because again they are planning, it has been a little bit slower. So, we don\u2019t have a strong projection as to the exact timing, so we do not expect much to go on in 2017. Blaine Heck : So none of that tailwind is incorporated in guidance? Michael LaBelle : No, I mean if anything, it's is going to be a headwind in the quarters when we have these dollars, and we\u2019ll have to explain it in that quarter, because it's really kind of an unusual thing. Blaine Heck : Great, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you, guys. Michael LaBelle : We\u2019re pre-paying ground rent that we\u2019re straight-lining over 99 years. Blaine Heck : Right. Michael LaBelle : So we will point it out when it happens so that people understand. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Jamie Feldman : I guess, just going back to Ray, can you talk more about what you\u2019re seeing in the suburb, you guys gave a lot of color on CBD. But it seems like you had some traction on leasing. And then just kind of bigger picture as we\u2019re sitting here this time next year, what do you think it's going to go different in DC? Ray Ritchey : Again, I think like downtown, the suburbs are sub-market by sub-market, western still remains very strong. We got less than a 3% vacancy and strong demand there. Tysons seems to be -- again that is not a market we\u2019re in, but seems to be getting some legs revitalization in the defense and the intel market. We\u2019re seeing some net migrations into the region, some corporations outside of Washington they are looking at suburban options. What is funny, I went to the Cushman briefing last night on where the market is headed, and they are very big on the maturation of the order of generation, moving out to cities, forming households, having children, looking for better schools. And that\u2019s going to drive great demand in the suburbs in the coming three to five years. Along those lines, we saw on the Dallas corridor, if you wanted more than 50,000 square-feet in the Dallas corridor, you only have three to four options to choose from. Whereas this time last year, you probably had 10 to 15. The 270 corridor still very weak, nothing to really report there, and of course with our announced Marriott deal pulling Marriott out of the North Bethesda market that will be a continued challenge we know that will come in the future. On the defense intel, as Doug mentioned, our two parts that are most directly associated with defense and intel and Apple's junction in VA 95, we\u2019ve had tremendous activity on those -- both those properties in the last three to five weeks with over 250,000 square-feet of prospects coming in since the election. The army corridor Roseland, Boston, I think they\u2019re starting to stabilize, and getting some traction. But as long as there's value downtown, the close-end suburbs don't have their natural feeder market to generate demand as much as they would like to see. So, again as with downtown, it\u2019s much more market-by-market, although the general trend is more positive. Jamie Feldman : Given the shift, it seems like contractors are getting a little healthier, at least the expectations post elections. Do you have any thoughts in growing more there, or continue this one? Ray Ritchey : I mean, if the Trump initiative about freezing government hiring if that put into place, this is not the first time this has been tried both President Reagan tried to do this back in the early to mid 80s. And all that happened was the defense contractors, the private sector guys, expanded greatly to fill the void. And we'd much rather prefer doing deals with private sector contractors than try to work with the GSA on government expansions. So if in fact the freeze is put into place, we view that as a positive thing in terms of the -- the demand for those services aren\u2019t going away. And so because it shifted from the public to the private sector, that's a good thing for Northern Virginia landlords. Jamie Feldman : And then just shifting to the GM building, maybe Mike, can you just walk us through the ins and outs there as we think about how the model is going to look the next couple of years. And also the Apple lease, can you talk about the NOI? Douglas Linde : So, I'll refer to -- answer the second part of your question first. So we've talked about the Apple lease before, and the Under Armor lease. And I think I don't have it in front of me, but my recollection is that we're going from somewhere around $50 million plus of NOI currently to somewhere over $85 million of NOI when Apple moves back into their rehabilitated store and Under Armor has completed their work and/or gets to live in their space and they're starting to pay on a full run rate basis. And so I think that\u2019s that part. On the General Motors\u2019 building office space where as I think we might say we have a termination income this quarter and next quarter as the tenant moves out of the space that they're moving out of in the lower floors and then we have to lease it up. And John, if I say, we\u2019re going to lease it up in the next two days, you're going to say no. If I said we\u2019re going to lease up in the next year or so, he's going to say absolutely. And so the timing of that's going to depend upon the condition of the space when we leased it up, and the overall leasing strategy we have for it. So, I don\u2019t think there's a lot to change there over the next couple of years in General Motors. Michael LaBelle : And the only other thing is we do have the 80,000 square-feet of current vacancy that we\u2019ve got that in July. So, as Doug mentioned, we've leased about 25,000 square-feet of that and we\u2019ve got good activity on the rest that none of that space will hit in 2017, because it's got to be built out. But I would expect all of that space should hit in 2018, I mean, that's high value space. Jamie Feldman : And is the termination -- is that Estee Lauder, or is that lease still under discussions? Michael LaBelle : As the Estee Lauder has lease expiration they're in almost 300,000 square-feet space. So what we're dealing with is another intendment to both. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel. John Guinee : Ray, talk a little bit about JBG Smith they\u2019re coming on the radar screen. Any new hires there, any senior leasing guys that you think are particularly talented? Ray Ritchey : That's a interesting question to answer. To those of you who don't know my son, David, recently joined head of the leasing of the combined firm. And I\u2019d say he's got one of the most challenging jobs in Washington, but it's sort of like Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader going head-to-head. So we'll see how that works out in the future. John Guinee : And second, you've been pretty busy you\u2019ve got the 2100 Penn deal done. You've got the Marriott deal. You've done a lot in L.A. I don't know if you\u2019re going to miss these deals or not. But can you talk a little bit about the potential Nestle headquarter relocation to DC, as well as the FBI never ending saga? Ray Ritchey : I can make absolutely no comment on Nestle. First of all, I've no knowledge on Nestle, and have none capacity to comment on that at all. On the FBI, I inquired to my sources within the GSA what the impacts would be on the FBI deal on the change in administration. She says full steam ahead. But I cannot believe a President as actively involved in real-estate with such an interest who owns a major asset directly across the street from the FBI building, will not have a very profound and active role in seeing what the future that maybe. But according to GSA, it's full steam ahead, there's still three candidates left for that site. We elected to not to participate in that, even though we were selected as the finalist about a year ago and there is still three sites, two in Maryland one in Virginia that's being considered. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : It sounds like the leases signed this quarter were partially cyclical in nature. But I was wondering if you could categorize at leases between expansionary versus maintaining or reducing space? Douglas Linde : I would gather to guess, I don't have the list in front of me that there is virtually no reduction in space by any of the tenants that signed the lease this quarter. And there was likely modest expansion in the majority of the leases that were not straight renewals. John Kim : So, it seems like from your commentary that the tenants are more optimistic than maybe perhaps you are at this point. Am I reading it correctly? Douglas Linde : No, I actually think we're optimistic about the demand. I think our point is that there's additional supply out there. And so when you have additional supply, you still have to deal with needing to grow more than that incremental demand to make a meaningful impact on the availability and the vacancy rates, so that you can drive rents. And there's just not enough of it overall in our marketplaces to do that. So things have -- the rate of growth has moderated, which we've talked about before. As I said, we're seeing demand growth from the technology and the life sciences businesses across the Boston marketplace and the San Francisco marketplace, and in New York City. We are seeing small signs of stability and positive growth from some of the smaller financial services companies in and around New York City and in Boston, and in San Francisco. But there happens to be more supply coming online, and that supply is impacting the market from an overall availability perspective. And so, it's awful hard to drive rental rate increases in a market like that. John Kim : I may have missed this. But can you provide the dollar figure on the future development projects that you announced last night? Douglas Linde : We have not yet come out with an official budget. The only development projects that we announced -- the word announce, I am going to make sure is what the right one is. We signed a lease for a development for Akamai as Owen described. That project is in Cambridge and that project will have a budget about somewhere around $400 million plus or minus. We\u2019re working through our budgets right now, so we haven't published the number in our supplemental information yet. John Kim : And so, how do you trying to fund the development, it sounds like you have $200 million of dispositions in your guidance. But I am not sure if that is surely for guidance purposes, or if you actually think you\u2019re going to sale more than that amount? Ray Ritchey : I think that as we have described our expectation is that we\u2019re going to raise that capital to fund our development outflows over the next few years. If you remember, the building that Doug is describing, that\u2019s not going to be done until the first quarter of '20. So, this $400 million that goes out over three years of the timeframe. So, given our leverage situation, we would anticipate that we would fund that through additional debt. I mean, there could be moderate asset sales over the next couple of years that we will supplement that. We do not typically put dispositions in our guidance, so just to point that out. We are looking at potentially $200 million of maybe asset sales. We haven't identified those asset fairly. So that\u2019s necessary in our guidance today, just to be aware. Michael LaBelle : I think you asked a good question, or one that deserves what I think is a very optimistic answer on our part, which is that, and we\u2019ve been saying this consistently for the last year or so. We don\u2019t have any intension to raising any equity, and we believe that as the cash flow from our current development pipeline, which is already in progress, starts to hit our books and it's hitting our books '16, '17 and '18. We are building tremendous amounts of capacity to fund additional investments, and we\u2019re building additional capacity by reducing our net debt to EBITDA. So, we have a terrific opportunity to actually be more acquisitive from a development perspective or a straight acquisition perspective as we move out with our current equity base and the fact that we\u2019re growing our cash flow significantly. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc. Craig Mailman : Mike, just wonder if you could provide some updated thoughts on plans for the GM loan refinance? Michael LaBelle : So, that loan expires in October of 2017. It's possible that we could refinance it a little bit early. We are expecting to be talking to the market in a formal way later in the first quarter. In terms of the execution of that, we would anticipate that we are going to refinance it as mortgage finance like it is today. If you look at the cash flows that can be generated and are being generated by that asset, it's under leverage today. So, we have the ability, if we want, to risk some incremental proceeds in that way, so that could be part of the $500 million to $700 million of additional debt capital that I mentioned that we raised. It's a large loan. So the two primary sources for that are the CMBS market which is very attractive market today. Spreads have come in over the last two or three quarters nicely. Obviously, the swap rates and treasuries have moved up 50 basis points in the last quarter, and spreads have not come in 50 basis points, but they have come in. And then we could also do a large syndicated facility with banks and insurance companies, and folks like that. So that those are kind of the two executions that we would look at to do in long-term, long-term being seven to 10 year mortgage financing. Craig Mailman : And then just on the Oakland option for the resi, can you just give a little bit more detail about the terms of that, and where we are in the cycle. How you guys weigh that versus moving forward? Owen Thomas : Well, we, as you know, are building our residential portfolio generally in the Company. It's currently a small component of our NOI but we have completed and have -- we've completed several successful residential developments and have a few under way. We identified the [technical difficulty] neighborhood in Oakland as a improving area and one that is attractive for development, particularly given the site that we're looking at, direct access to public transport into San Francisco, and the rents that we'll be able to offer to market are at significant discount to the rents in central San Francisco. We are paying attention to market conditions. We understand the deliveries that are there, and we're factoring that into our underwriting. And in terms of the specific economics of the deal that we're doing, I think it's too early for us to discuss that. But when and if we decide to go forward with this project, we'll certainly describe the exact financial arrangements, but we think they're attractive. Craig Mailman : Is it just an option you guys have, or did you -- by the way, I'm just curious how long the options for if that's the case? Owen Thomas : Right now, it's an option. And the other activity that's going on is very important as the entitlement of the site. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Just a more granular question on New York leasing and your pipeline there, you sort of walked us through, and the space that you lease-up and price points around the $100 range. Could you walk us through what you're seeing in terms of demand or even just early showings that you might have done around some of the new redevelopments that you're doing? Owen Thomas : John, you want to take that one? John Powers : Sure. Well, we\u2019ve had -- we're dealing with a number of different buildings. I think we have very good showings at 159, and we're looking for like a 150,000 foot tenant. We had very good activity in the Tower at 399 the seventh floor is very difficult to show right now because of the construction project that's ongoing. Vikram Malhotra : And just, but just in terms of which sector -- are you seeing broad range of sectors. Is it more finance? And just a sense of price points, are they similar to expirations or wider range? John Powers : I think it's a pretty broad range, some financial service firms, and some corporates. Vikram Malhotra : And then just a quick clarification, I remember last quarter, there was an asset in Springfield you were marketing. I think there was someone circling around the tenant, and you took that off. Any update on the potential sale there? Owen Thomas : That project is VA 95. And as we announced the last quarter, the primary tenant in the project announced -- put out an RFP for a potential consolidation. So that uncertainty made the asset more difficult to market. And frankly the consolidation could be an opportunity for us, because we're going to compete for that. But we need to, I would say, re-stabilize that building before considering selling it. I also just want John to take a victory lap. I think we were identified as the highest, the leading real-estate company in New York with lease space over $100 square foot in 2016. So, the volumes in that market are not large, but we captured the highest share last year. Vikram Malhotra : That\u2019s good to know. Thank you very much. John Powers : By the way, that\u2019s not our usual. But thank you very much, Owen. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick, Cap One Securities. Tom Lesnick : I'll keep it brief since we're pretty late into the call here. But earlier, you guys mentioned properties in need to CapEx in your markets. Bigger picture, how do you guys view the risk adjusted value proposition between development and well located value-add acquisitions? And how that changed at all in the last few quarters? Owen Thomas : Well, we prefer or we -- actually I would say, exclusively right now, are making investments where we can use our real-estate skills to create value. Doug described it in his remarks that a key value proposition for whole company. So, we're not interested in purchasing stabilized assets, the cap rates in the force, because they -- when we have the opportunity to create more value by either buying under-let assets or by development. And I think the examples of that are we have a very significant multi-billion dollar development pipeline underway, and we're still forecasting a cash NOI yield upon delivery for that portfolio in excess of 7%. All the projects that we delivered last year were in excess of 7%. And when we think those buildings are delivered, again it depends a little bit on where they are and what there. But if again stabilize buildings in our core markets are selling for four, because that's a significant profit that's realized by shareholders. So, to the extent we can continue to find projects, they're painful that way. We want to go forward with them. I would say the one thing that has changed that we've talked about over the last few quarters as we get further into the economic recovery as we see supply in our markets that does describe our pre-letting requirement for launching a new development had elevated. We don't have exact percentage that we adhere to, because it depends on the project and scale and the market condition. But clearly, our threshold for pre-letting is higher in office today. And I would say the other thing by the way we've done in addition to development is trying to purchase assets where when we lease them and when they roll to market that we will own them at a premium yield, certainly the 4%. And I think Colorado Center deal I would point to much recently that we did where I think those facts are going to come true. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rob Simone with Evercore ISI. Rob Simone : My questions have all been answered. I was curious if you guys have selected any candidates for the asset sales that Mike mentioned. But you guys touched on that, so I\u2019m good. Thanks. Owen Thomas : Good. Well again, that concludes the questions. Thank you for your interest in Boston Properties and your time and attention today. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

During the question-and-answer portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, Senior Executive Vice President and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks. Owen Thomas : Thank you, Arista and good morning everyone. On current results are FFO per share for the quarter was in line with our prior forecast and we increased the midpoint of our full year 2017 guidance by a penny driven by operational improvements. We leased 565,000 square feet in the first quarter, which is below our long term averages for this period. This level of leasing is not a reflection of the health of the market or the vibrancy of our tour and proposal activity, but it is due to the cadence of our lease expirations the lumpiness of our largely transactions as well the fact that we leased three million square feet in the fourth quarter of last year. Our in-service office portfolio occupancy is now 90.4%, which is up 20 basis points from the end of the fourth quarter. We also had another quarter of positive rent roll ups in our leasing activity with rental rates on leases that commenced in the first quarter of 13% on a gross basis and 20% on a net basis compared to the prior lease, which was driven substantially by our California assets. New investment and disposition activity was relatively light in the quarter, but we recently completed two major financings at very attractive terms which Mike who by the way is having a $4.5 billion financing week will discussed in detail later in the call. Moving to the economic environment, U.S. economic growth continues to be a little sluggish with fourth quarter GDP growth estimates of 2.1% the employment picture also continues to improve incrementally with 98,000 jobs created in March, and the unemployment rate dropped to 4.5%. In the capital markets the 10 year U.S. Treasury also dropped around 30 basis points to 2.2% since the end of the last quarter. So financial markets are reflecting increased skepticism over fiscal and tax stimulus related to the new administration the Federal Reserve has not altered its rhetoric on increasing rates at a more rapid rate in 2017. Notwithstanding current Fed posture given continued sluggish growth, low inflation, the uncertainty associated with federal fiscal stimulus and tax cuts and the current realities of demography we're not overly concerned about a sharp rise in long term interest rates and anticipate at least for now a continuation of reasonably healthy operating in financial market conditions. I commented last quarter on the potential likelihood and impacts of proposed tax reform on Boston Properties business. So tax reform continues to be high on the agenda in Washington D.C. I will reiterate that the probability terms, timing and potential impact of such reform on Boston Properties is very difficult to project. Particularly with the recent challenges of ACA reform effort. Now given the growth in the U.S. economy the office markets where we operate have positive demand and healthy activity, but are in relative equilibrium given additions to supply. In the CBDs of our four core markets and West LA, net absorption is projected to be 4.7 million square feet or around 0.8% of stock for all of 2017 while additions to supply are projected to be 6.4 million feet or approximately 1% of stock over the same period. Asking rents are projected for rise 1.5% in 2017 while vacancies projected increase 30 basis points to 8.3%. Our leasing activity remains active with pockets of strength and weakness, which Doug will describe later in the call. In the private real estate market there continues to be a strong bid in size for high quality office assets in our core markets as once again several transactions were completed at attractive pricing over the last quarter. Notable examples are as follows. Starting in Santa Monica, 1299 Ocean Avenue at 206,000 square foot office building with an oceanfront location sold for $1385 of square foot and a 2.5% initial cap rate to a domestic REIT partnered with non-U.S. capital this is a record price per square foot for the L.A. region though the yield is low because the top two floors of the building are vacant. We think the stabilized cap rate is probably in the mid-to-high 4% range. In Boston 45% interest in the Vertex building, two assets comprising 1.1 million square feet located in the Seaport District sold for $1058 a square foot and a 4.3% cap rate to a sovereign wealth fund. In Arlington, Virginia, Waterview a 647,000 square foot office building sold for around $711 a square foot, which was a 5.5 cap rate to a domestic pension advisor. This is also a record price per square foot for suburban Washington. So the major tenant to building is expected to relocate though there is term on the lease and the underlying sub market has material vacancy. And lastly in New York, 245 Park Avenue a 1.8 million square foot, 50 year old office tower located near Grand Central and likely requiring some future renovation is being sold to a Chinese corporation for $1243 a square foot and a 5.1% cap rate. Otherwise our understanding this transaction is being financed with a $1.8 billion mortgage, which is around 81% of the purchase price at a rate of approximately four 4.5% for 10 years. Given these examples and dialogues that that we are having, we continue to see strong private market interest from domestic and non-U.S. capital sources and high quality real estate particularly CBD office in our core markets. So in summary given the relative steady state of the operating and capital markets where we operate over the last quarter, we're continuing to execute capital strategy, we've been employing over the last few years, which entails growth through aggressive leasing, selected development of prelease projects and targeted acquisitions of under that assets will protect the downside by keeping leverage low and financing development through asset sales and additional debt capacity from our NOI. Moving to the execution of our capital strategy for the quarter and starting with acquisitions we continued actively pursue development and value added building investments though we are looking in all of our core markets L.A. remains the priority a given our desire to build on our presence in the market. In terms of specific deals last week we committed to enter into a long term ground lease with the purchase option and to build MacArthur station residences, which is a 402 unit 24 storey residential project with 13,000 square feet of associated retail located in [technical difficulty] neighborhood of Oakland. Temescal is an increasingly desirable area of Oakland with limited quality rental housing and no high rise development and the complex provides residents with immediate proximity to the McArthur BART station with direct access to downtown San Francisco, downtown Oakland and Berkeley. Likely renters will be commuters to downtown San Francisco given we expect our rents will be a 15% or greater discount to rents in the CBD workers in the hospitals that are located proximate to our site and or students at Cal Berkeley. The total cost of the project is approximately $265 million excluding land value that will be determined based upon a formula following stabilization and construction will not commence until mid-2018. MacArthur station residence is our first standalone and San Francisco residential project. On dispositions were actively in the market with 500 East Street in Washington D.C. and in various stages of selling a handful of land sites and buildings in the suburbs of Washington and Boston. For 2017 we continue to anticipate projected total gross proceeds from dispositions in excess of $200 million. Moving to development this past quarter, we delivered in the service to 15,000 square foot expansion of our Prudential Retail Center and remain active advancing our pre-development pipeline for projects that will start after 2017. At the end of the first quarter our development pipeline consists of six new projects and three redevelopments totaling four million square feet and 2.3 billion in our share of projected costs of which 1.3 billion has been funded through the end of the first quarter. Our projected cash NOI for these developments remains in excess of 7% and the preleasing of the commercial component increased 6% in the quarter to 54%. Looking forward in the development pipeline, we anticipate construction completion of the Salesforce Tower later this year with initial tenant occupancy in early 2018 and have already identified several projects to refill this important growth component for Boston Properties. As discussed in previous calls will be commencing a new headquarters for Akamai in Cambridge this month and over the next three years will likely add a new headquarters from Marriott, 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue, and MacArthur Station residences. In aggregate these projects alone represent nearly two million square feet, $1.2 billion of cost on our share basis has extensive preleasing and we believe can be delivered at an initial cash return approaching 7%. So to conclude, we remain very enthusiastic about our prospects for growth and creating shareholder value in the quarters and years ahead. We're making good progress on our clearly communicated and achievable plan to increase our NOI by 20% to 25% by the year 2020 through development and leasing up our existing assets from approximately 90% to 93%. And this growth of course excludes our recent new business wins and potential new investments for which we have significant capacity. Let me turn over to Doug. Douglas Linde : Thanks Owen, good morning everybody. The total market colors that I'm going to convey this morning is very consistent with our comments over the last few quarters, and I think it's really in sync with the overall tenor of the economy that Owen just described. Demand growth from technology and life science businesses are the primary drivers of positive absorption across all markets while lease expirations are dominating overall activity. Base utilization by large institutional office tenants and the legal in the large financial services sector has stabilized though we continue to see space reductions stemming from design changes as lease has expired and there have been flow of growth in decline from smaller alternative asset management firms as Pacific Investment Strategies don't always work out forever. Under the current macroeconomic conditions, we believe the most dominant issue is the impact of new supply with ensuing tenant relocations versus incremental demand and the realities of the time needed to rebuild, reinvest and re-tenant existing inventory in all our markets. Looking at the statistics from this quarter the size of the pool of the leases that's reflected in our first quarter same store portfolio was pretty small about 150,000 square feet in Boston, 100,000 square feet in New York City and in Washington D.C. and 240,000 square feet in San Francisco. The Boston same store statistics included a full floor deal of Prudential Center, which is actually cut on a low rise floor back in 2000 and late 2015, early 2015 and where the rents have declined from $76 to $61. So if you exclude this transaction we are actually up about 6% in the Boston area. And in New York City the release of one of the low rise Citibank floors at 399 where the rent move from $92 down to the low 80's impacted those numbers and those that's what we've been describing would be going on at 399. San Francisco continues to benefit from the math of roll up that we've been seeing over the last couple of years and interestingly in D.C. this quarter all of the transactions were in Northern Virginia there were no D.C. proper deals that were in those same stores. I'm going to start my regional comments with Salesforce Tower. I'm delighted to be able to report that we signed 100,000 square foot lease this quarter, which brings us sign leases to 960,000 square feet or just shy of 70% of the building. We have two continues blocks remaining floors 35 through 44, a 250,000 square feet and floor it's 51 through 58, a 170,000 square feet. During our internal marketing call last week, we discussed half a dozen active proposals from 200,000 square feet to a single floor 25,000 square feet. The current discussions involve law firm some tech firms, working firms, and assortment of small financial services organizations private equity firms, D.C. firms and hedge funds. We topped off the building a few weeks ago, but initial tenant improvement stocking and layout have yet to commence for any of the tentative sign leases, so we again we don't anticipate having any occupancy or revenue recognition in the building in 2017 as tenants physically complete their space we can start recognizing revenue. Even though the spaces leased and in many cases we're paying rent. The available space left in the building is priced at the upper end of the market high 80's and up with our lowest floor being 35, we are offering a very attractive price relative to the other new high rise construction in the market. During the last quarter we have been a handful of transactions in traditional inventory Embarcadero Center Four one market the ferry building that have all been completed over $90 of square foot as compared to our pricing expectations at the brand new Salesforce Tower. Market conditions in the city certainly with previous quarters there are limited large blocks of public space and there continues to be a number of larger requirements in the market, but they're under 200,000 square feet not the 500,000 square foot tickets that we saw in 2014 and 2015. This quarter Google expanded by 100,000 square feet, the Auto Group took 130,000 square feet, Adobe expanded by 100,000 square feet, Slack took 200,000 square feet and we did our deals Salesforce Tower. CBRE reports that there were 12 deals over 100,000 square feet in 2016 and there have been six deals year-to-date in 2017 over 100,000 square feet. So the story of following the San Francisco CBD will be the continued demand growth and tenant respond to the place of new construction. During the first week in April, we signed another 62,000 square foot deal at Colorado Center, bringing our committed space in 93%. So Ray and our outside leasing team have brought the property from 65% leased to 92% leased in eight months. We have a number of discussions ongoing on the final piece of space. Our repositioning plans are close to complete and we're working with a local permanent story with a goal of commencing construction on the interior work by the end of 2017. Overall, leasing velocity in the Greater West LA market has moderated slightly. So we were actually in discussions with one large tenant in the market with growth plans that we can no longer satisfy at Colorado Center. Turning to the Boston region; we ended the first quarter with the issuance of our special permit for the construction of 145 Broadway the Akamai building. We are underway with the demolition of the existing 79,000 square foot building and 31 months away from delivering our new 486,000 square foot fully leased building. This investment will be added to our supplemental next quarter at a total GAAP cost of approximate of $375 million, but the budget is still evolving. Our other near term opportunity in Cambridge will be in early 2018 and we have the opportunity to release 100,000 square feet of partly occupied space by Microsoft at 255 Main that is expiring at the end of this year. Not only is this in the heart of Kendall Square, but the space has its own dedicated entrance if a tenant is interested in expressing its brand. The Cambridge office market continues to be very tight and expensive forcing tenants to consider alternative location like our hub on Causeway project. Across the river at 120 St. James and 200 Clarendon, we are making significant progress leasing our vacancy. We complete our third lease at 120 St. James, 32,000 square feet and are negotiating another lease to 50,000 square feet which will bring the low rise building to over 75% leased and we have actively under our remain 50,000 square feet. There are not a lot of large expiration driven requirement in the Boston CBD market, so we expect leasing activity will be concentrated in transactions between 5,000 square feet and 50,000 square feet. Rents are stable so depending upon the condition of the space, the landlord contribution to tenant improvement has risen. We are also in discussions on two full floors in the midrise and of comments our first prebuilt program in the building i.e. higher TIs in the hope of accelerating occupancy and our negotiating our first deals today. At the hub on Causeway, we've signed a lease with Live Nation for 32,000 square feet, which will create another entertainment venue and we're seeing lots of interest for 175,000 square feet of office space, which is under development and will deliver in the first half of 2019. Then the demand is primarily technology to tenants that are either considering relocation from the suburbs in Cambridge [technical difficulty]. In our Lexington and Washington suburban portfolio we completed a lease for about 50% of our redevelopment at 191 Spring Street, where we hope to have initial occupancy by the fourth quarter of 2017. We've also responded to a number of built to super puzzles at our city point land holdings and if we were able to land one of those major lease commitments this would add to our investment pipeline for 2018 and beyond. In any of these projects get going rent will likely be an excess to 50 large as square feet growth. I want to focus my discussion in New York this morning at 399 Park Avenue. Supply continues to come in to New York in the form of new deliveries in Hudson Yard and Manhattan West in the World Trade Center and the corresponding large blocks of space return to the market and buildings like 4 Times Square, 65 East 55th, 1271 6th Avenue, the Americas and soon 399 Park Avenue. Landlords that are putting capital into other assets are attracting tenants. And space it is attractively we priced mid to high 80's starting rent is seems a very strong activity. While we're not anticipating office rent growth and we do expect higher concessions versus 2016 in our portfolio and 2017 and 2018, our repositioning activities are accelerating and we are offering products at varying pricing levels from the mid-80's at the base of the building to over $140 a square foot for our 40,000 square foot glass box with 13 foot finished ceiling and dedicated outdoor space. In 2017, we're collecting $31 million, the expiring tenants at 399 Park. We get this space back at the end of the third quarter. There are a lot of mid-sized financial and business service tenants in the market, we're making proposals, we're going to lease space consistent with these economics that I just described, but in almost every case, we're going to have to demolish the space the existing improvement can't be reused and occupancy will not be until 2019, which will mean that the base will not generate revenue in 2018. At 1590 53rd Street, which is currently out of service, it's also under heavy construction today. We've made a number of proposals on the 195,000 square feet of office space that's being rebuilt and can be delivered in early 2018, or optimistic that will have signed leases in place contemporaneously with the base building completion, but again revenue recognition is not expected until 2019. For marketing and brand building would greatly enhance in the lines, a brand to mechanical plant and tremendous outdoor on these on each floor. Leasing activity on the space price was starting rent above $100 a square foot continues to be active as measured by the number of transactions, but size continues to be the real governor. In the first quarter, there were very few deals above 30,000 square feet that we are aware of a few 50,000 square foot plus requirements that will land next quarter above $100 a square foot starting rent. We have a few smaller deals under negotiation of the General Motors building and to preempt the question yes our large tenant with the 2020 lease expiration has been actively evaluating their alternatives and we do not believe they have made any decisions yet. Finally in DC, the swap market fundamentals continue to be a challenge with significant available inventory and tenant favorable concession packages. Yeah, we are probably as busy as we have ever been pursuing new business, which involved long term forward leasing commitment. In addition to the 727,000 square foot headquarters transaction for Marriott we're in discussions with tenant for 70% of the office space we're permitting at 2100 Penn that's the 410,000 square foot office building with a 2023 delivery and we are now in dialogue with a tenant for 100% of our proposed new development in Reston Town Center, 1750, a 275,000 square foot office building. And finally, we continue to patiently await word from the GSA, on their selection of a site for the 620,000 square foot GSA requirement. This quarter, we executed a 53,000 of at least with the GSA at our VA 95 Park, which is in close proximity to Fort Boulevard and we're discussions with a contractor for 70,000 square foot space in that same Park. And in Reston Town Center, in addition to build the super puzzle [ph] we have strong activity on a 38,000 square foot block of space which we have yet to get back, but will be getting back to the end of this quarter where we have multiple tenants competing for the space. Before I turn the call over to Mike, I just want to give a quick update on our contractual income that's coming from our lease up in our high contribution building. So as of the end of the quarter, we completed leases with annualize revenues of $62 million towards our target of $111 million, $24 million of that is in our 2107 projection. Finally, we're now 54% leased on our development pipeline where we anticipate 2020 annual incremental NOI of $238 million upon stabilization versus year end 2015. And with that, I'll give the call to Mike. Michael LaBelle : Great. Thank you, Doug. Good morning, everybody. I planned to discuss our recent financing activity earnings for the quarter the increase in our 2017 guidance as well as touch on a few assumptions we think are important for you to consider as you think about our 2018 projected earnings. I'm going to start by describing our activity in the debt markets, because we've been quite busy again this quarter including executing $4.3 billion of new financing commitments. Earlier this week, we closed on a five year renewal of our revolving line of credit. We increased the size from a $1 billion to $1.5 billion and we improved our pricing. This extends out the availability on our facility from its prior maturity date in 2018 to 2022. At the same time, we close on a $500 million, five year delay drop term loan price at LIBOR plus 95 basis points. We have not borrowed under the facility and it includes a feature that allows us to delay usage for up to 12 months which makes it an ideal facility to fund a portion of our committed future development costs. Our bank group that includes 16 of our trusted partners to help us put together this $2 billion in bank financing and we truly appreciate their continued support. The most significant financing that we plan to complete this year at the refinancing of 767 Fifth Avenue, the GM building. We own 60% of the building and it currently has $1.6 billion of first mortgage and mezzanine loans that expire in October of 2017 at an interest rate of 6%. We've been in the market for replacement financing to repay both the existing loans and provide additional proceeds based upon the significant growth in cash flow we've generated since our acquisition. As outlined in our press release, we have entered into a rate lock and commitment for a 10 year financing of $2.3 billion at a fixed interest rate of 3.43%. Our share of the cash interest payment on the new facility will be $9 million less per year than the existing loan even though we're borrowing an additional $700 million. We expect to close the loan in early June when the current loan becomes open for prepayment without penalty. Since we have been recording a non-cash fair value interest component on the current loan, which effectively brings the interest rate down to 3% this refinancing will actually be dilutive to our future FFO by approximately $0.12 per share annually. The refinancing will have a significant impact on second quarter results. First the remaining fair value interest on our balance sheet will be accelerated through our P&L and is expected to result in an additional $14 million of gain on debt extinguishment. Our 60% share of this is approximately $0.05. Additionally the original structure of the deal required investments by the partners in the form of partner loans in lieu of equity. We have booking interest expense due to the outside partners loan every quarter and it is fully allocated to them through non-controlling interest. The net impact to our earnings of this is zero. We expect a pay off the loans as part of the refinancing and going forward both our interest expense and our non-controlling interest will be lower by the amount of the interest. So starting with the third quarter of 2017, our consolidated interest expense will be much simpler to model and we expect a run rate starting in the third quarter of approximately $90 million to $95 million per quarter. In 2018 our interest expense will be higher at our capitalized interest will start to roll up with the delivery of our development. In addition, we're in the process of finalizing documentation for a construction loan on the first phase of our hub on Causeway project in Boston. The loan will fund the vast majority of the remaining costs for the $284 million project where we are 50% owner. So overall our share of our current development pipeline has $800 million of equity remaining to fund through completion over the next couple of years. As Doug described, we're starting the enabling work on our next Cambridge development and if several additional potential projects in the pipeline that will add to our capital needs. These three financing transactions provides funding necessary to complete our current development program as well as ample liquidity for future investment. Now I want to turn to our earnings. For the first quarter, we reported funds from operations of a $1.48 per share that was right in line with our guidance. The quarter was impacted by $2 million of timing difference associated with the recognition of termination income for the tenant at the GM building we spoke about last quarter. We still anticipate earning the same amount of income, but a portion of it has been moved from the first quarter to the second quarter, which negatively impacted our earnings in the first quarter versus our guidance. Excluding the timing change our FFO would have exceeded our expectations by about $2 million or just over a penny per share. This improvement emanated from a combination of about $1 million of higher portfolio NOI and the rest from service fee income. As we look ahead to the rest of 2017 there are a few changes to our prior guidance. As I mentioned earlier our refinancing activity will result in a shift in dollars out of interest expense and into our non-controlling interest in property partnerships loan, but has minimal impact on guidance. We have reduced our guidance range for net interest expense, which includes debt extinguishment cost to $355 million to $368 million that represents a $0.13 per share savings. However our guidance for deduction for non-controlling interest in property partnerships increased to $117 million to $132 million representing $0.13 per share of additional deduction from FFO, so net-net a lot of moving pieces, but no change in our FFO guidance from this. In our same property portfolio, we have elected it to an early take back of 170,000 square feet at 399 Park Avenue from Citibank. This space had a natural expiration date of September 30, 1017 Citibank has been in the space for a long time and will need to be demolished and then refit for a new tenant. Taking it back early allows us to start preparing the space for marketing with the goal of shortening the down time. It is possible we could take additional near term expiring space back if it is vacated. The impact of this is a shift in revenue categorization from same property rental income to termination income. We will still generate the same amount of revenue, but will pull it out of our same property bucket. For this reason we have reduced our assumption for same property growth for both GAAP and cash NOI by 50 basis points and we increased our assumption for termination income to $21 million to $25 million for the year. Overall we have increased our guidance range from last quarter to $6.15 to $6.23 per share representing an increase of a penny per share at the midpoint. The increase is due to better projected portfolio NOI. As you start to look at your 2018 models there are three things that we think you should keep in mind. First is interest expense, we project our fourth quarter 2017 run rate to be $90 million to $95 million. We anticipate capitalized interest on our development destruct a run-off in 2018 as we deliver some of our larger projects like Salesforce Tower. Based on what we know today, we expect our interest expense in 2018 to be between $390 million and $410 million. As we bring our development income in the service there is an increase in interest expense. Second is our same property growth. As Doug described, we signed leases for a significant amount of our NOI bridge, which we expect to contribute to solid growth in our same property NOI over the next couple of years, but remember that the impact of loss revenue from lease expirations at 399 Park Avenue will moderate our same property growth in 2018 the expected lost income from 399 Park from 2017 to 2018 equates to approximately 2% of our same property NOI pool. And lastly as our development pipeline. We provided a very clear path of the projected growth in NOI from our development deliveries and our quarterly investor materials. Between late 2017 and end of 2018 we will be delivering some of the most significant projects in our pipeline. These include completing the lease up of 888 Boylston Street including the occupancy by Natixis in 155,000 square feet in the fourth quarter of 2017. The initial occupancy of tenants in Salesforce Tower beginning in early 2018 were occupancy is projected to face in through 2019 and the delivery of our two residential projects in Cambridge and Reston in early 2018. So revenue recognition for these projects will not all referring 2018 it will be split between 2018 and 2019 as tenants occupy their space. We have contractual leases that are projected to generate incremental NOI growth in 2018 of $25 million to $30 million from 2017. The remaining lease up is projected to generate additional income in 2018 and into 2019 as full lease up is achieved. The last thing I want to mention is that we are planning our triennial BXP Investor Conference that fall. The day will be on October 4th it will be in Boston and we'll be sending out more information to you soon. We look forward to seeing you all there and as always appreciate your support. That's completes our formal remarks. Operator if you can open up the lines for questions that would be great. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Jamie Feldman : Great, thank you, good morning. I was hoping you could focus on the leasing spreads in the quarter, bit difference across the markets. Can you maybe talk through your expectations going forward and whether the net in gross leasing spreads with representative of the mark-to-market in those markets for you guys right now? Douglas Linde : Sure Jamie, this is Doug. Again I think I give a little bit of color on what you saw this quarter and again it was a pretty small portfolio relatively speaking that pushed their way through in terms of when the new cash rents commenced. I think that you will continue to see very strong numbers in San Francisco as we complete the million plus square feet of rollover that we had in a Embarcadero Center starting in late 2015 that going into 2016 and 2017. I think you'll see a reasonably strong number in Boston as you see the rents rolling through at 120 St. James and 200 Clarendon Street which is where the bulk of the vacancy is because those rents were so low and you recall when we bought the property, we told you that the rents were $35 to $38 at the base of the building and in the mid-50s at the face of the top of the building and we're obviously doing deals in the mid-50's the base and then in 60's, 70's and 80's up of the top of the building. In the Washington D.C. portfolio the challenge with the mark-to-market is that every single year we're able to negotiate leases with 2.5% to 3% increases. So as those increases occur obviously the rents go up so generally when you get to the end of the lease in Washington D.C. there's not much of a jump in the mark-to-market. And then in New York City, as I've described before it's very, very hit or miss and so at 399, which are we've been very clear about, we're basically going to be moderately higher overall in that building on the 500 plus or minus 1000 square feet that's rolling over because the when you're in a bit lease to Citibank it with at the end they're obviously their terms where they were bumped and then where would they be in new calculation payment. And then we'll see good increases at all of the space that's rolling over at 767 the General Motors building and then we'll - the other portfolio it's very space dependent on their spaces that are way above market and there are spaces that are there way below market. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And just a final question. Can you just talk more about the bay area market conditions in Silicon Valley versus the CBD in terms of tenant demand and how would supply is in back in those different market? Owen Thomas : Sure. I'll start now and let Bob Pester make some comments as well. Overall we have - I'd say we've seen a very consistent stream of demand in the CBD and the vast majority of has been growth. And while that the ticket size has declined from the large scale 500,000 to 700,000 square foot requirements that were growth requirements that we saw in 2014 and 2015, there's a pretty strong number of 100 plus 1000 square foot new tenant demand drivers that is in the CBD. In the Silicon Valley, there are two or three primary drivers of growth that have been occurring for the past three or four years. Google is the first, Apple is the second and to some degree Facebook has been the third, they have been exceedingly large absorbers of space. There are a lot of opportunities to build new buildings in and around the Silicon Valley, which are for the most part have been tear down and while there is a plethora of midsize and other companies that are there, I would say that those are generally not we see young growing companies those are stable engineering firms that have a more stable and a less expansive growth trajectory than the three companies that I described. And so I would say that overall there's been less incremental demand down in the valley, now there are obviously been new companies that have gone down there like LinkedIn that's been a big grower on a relative basis compared to the first three they're smaller. Bob, if you want to add anything. Robert Pester : Yeah. I think if you talk to the brokers in the Silicon Valley they would say the quarter was somewhat flat, but there still were several transactions that happened I mean Amazon took almost 550,000 square feet in a couple of projects. Applied materials to go another 28,000 square feet in Sunnyvale, Bosch signed a lease in Sunnyvale for 104,000 feet. Adobe is one more to be looking at downtown San Jose for expansion of another 300,000 to 400,000, and Google who has been rumored quite some time in downtown San Jose looking at the Diridon station site that Temescal has potentially could be in the market for a million square. So overall, I would say the activity is still pretty good from an expansion standpoint down there. In San Francisco, just in the past month we've had three tenant go through sales force tower all four between 150,000 square feet and 300,000 square feet and we have another one coming by Friday Tech tenant for 300,000 feet. And that's probably the best activity of the large tenants that we've seen at any one time in the marketplace in the CBD, I would say in the past two and half years. Jamie Feldman : Okay, great. That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chau with Deutsche Bank. Vincent Chau : Hey everyone. Just curious, I mean I know you've touched on the deal flow in the private markets and still very attractive cap rates that you're seeing. Just curious in LA, outside of Santa Monica deal that you mentioned. What are the opportunities you're seeing in that market to expand beyond Colorado Center now that you are 93% or so prelease or leased there? Owen Thomas : Well, as I mentioned in my remarks, it is a focus for us in terms of the new investment activity. We do have a broader geography perimeter that we're focusing on beyond just Santa Monica and I think as described in prior calls, we've been looking at things imply this country city, a couple of other communities and West LA. I would say right now, we are chasing with various levels of intensity probably half a dozen different types of investment. Some are existing building that require some rehabilitation or value added and in a handful of situations we're also looking at development. Though West LA will remain a priority for us in terms of new investment and we intend to stay disciplined, we don't have a target by year-end or by year-end 2018 of a certain dollar amount that we want to invest. We want to do - we want to continue to do, what we did in Colorado Center, which is to invest in the property at a we think a reasonable price and create value with asset level for shareholders. We're not going to make investments just to grow in LA. Vincent Chau : Right. Okay. And that market has seen some slowdown in job growth for a couple months now and it sounds like the commentary was if there's some moderation in certain market leasing activity perspective. Is that having any impact on the opportunity set things like that or cap rates end market besides obviously the same market that you mentioned? Owen Thomas : I think the pricing is at elevated levels in West LA. But honestly it's true in other markets that we operate in, the capital markets are very robust, I've described deals have on prior quarters and other markets like Washington that are weaker than Santa Monica that are also high levels relative to history on a per square foot basis. So I don't think some of those underlying fundamentals that you're describing are impacting the capital market for buildings in West LA. Raymond Ritchey : Hey Owen Owen Thomas : Yes, sir Raymond Ritchey : This is Ray. I just did that virtually everything we look at in Los Angeles is off market transactions, because if we get a book on something we know it's probably going to be overpriced. So we're really focusing on identifying opportunities that haven't hit the market yet and the Boston Properties story is being very well we're see by some of the local smaller developers as great partners for their vertical development, so we're excited about that. Vincent Chau : Okay. Thanks. And just last question from me, I just going back to the East Coast, Reston Town Center just sounds like there's good demand there and you mentioned that one of the blocks the smaller ones that you're working on. Just curious, we saw kind of an interesting article out there just talking about the paid parking transition and some tenants complaining about how that's hurting their business, so I just curious to be any commentary on that. Owen Thomas : Yes. So we did implement paid parking at Reston Town Center at the beginning of the year. As you know Reston is an urban location, it has structure parking primarily, and there is going to be the arrival of mass transit to the region and certainly not uncommon for areas with this kind of density to have paid parking. We are utilizing a state of the art parking system that is being used in cities all over the U.S. and actually the use of these systems is growing around the U.S. In Reston specifically the system has been adopted by a 140,000 users so far. Now that being said as you suggest certainly not all of our customers some but certainly not all of our customers have expressed some concerns about the system or simply having to pay for parking and we are continuing to evaluate our execution and make adjustments to ensure that Reston remains preeminent location for business and resident in Northern Virginia. Vincent Chau : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi. Michael Bellaman : Hey, it's good morning. It's Michael Bellaman here with Manny. I was wondering if we can go back to your discussion during the call about private capital and you made mention of dialogue we are having. And I'm just curious if you can elaborate a little bit on the type of dialogue you're having there is it do you purchased properties, it is the sell additional properties and can you just delve a little deeper into those sorts of conversations and what you're hearing and learning from them? Owen Thomas : So let me just say Michael. First don't read anything into that. We are having dialogues of capital sources as we should be, but you shouldn't read anything more into it than other than that. But look as you might expect onshore and offshore investors that are interested in Class A office, they're interested in partnering with us, purchasing building, investing in our development, and we talk to those kind of groups there are intermediaries that work with those groups that also approach us about such opportunities. And so that in addition to watch to seeing the transactions that are going on in the market, and I try to describe them for all of you in each quarter, we are having some direct dialogues with these folks. But as I mentioned, our disposition targets for this year are more in the $200 range. Michael Bellaman : So you're looking at predominately any big acquisitions with Capital Partners and I guess how they think about those acquisitions versus how you would be underwriting them? Owen Thomas : How the Capital Partners would underwrite acquisitions versus how we would underwrite them? Michael Bellaman : Yeah I mean just an element of you know if you've had discussions with Capital Partners it's seeking some of these larger assets that have come to markets, I guess how aggressive are they willing to underwrite versus what you're willing to do or are they really seeking your lead and how do they think about on leverage returns versus you? Owen Thomas : Yeah. Well, I'd say that generally Michael as you know we haven't been acquiring stabilize assets without upside at the cap rates where the market has been trading over the last several years, if anything we sold more than we bought in that kind of market environment. We did these very significant joint ventures with north just a few years ago to raise capital for our development pipeline. So when we look at acquisitions there are more things like I would say like Colorado Center where the building initially with 66% lease, the cap rate was quite low, but upon leasing and then rolling the existing tenants to market the yield on the investment is much higher than where stabilize building will trade. So in general we haven't been prepared to purchase buildings at the yield that I described earlier in the call, and therefore we haven't done a lot of acquisitions joint ventures with these groups. Michael Bellaman : And then just a question and maybe for LaBelle just on the GM building refinance, can you talk a little bit about sort of the underwriting of that assets, so where was it targeted from a leverage perspectives to underwritten value a coverage perspective to cash flow and then of proceeds how much are you going to be able to pull out on to properties balance sheet versus help for some of the redevelopment efforts and tenant work that you're doing in the building? Michael LaBelle : So honestly really don't want to touch on the characteristics of the financing until closes. It's not going to close until June, so we're still kind of going through the process, but you know we've got a number of institutions that are sharing and what they have underwritten and agreed to lock in the commitment with us. With regard to the excess proceeds there's a pretty significant amount of closing costs, because we've got to - we anticipate that we're going to be paying mortgage tax and obviously we underline it around hedged, so if the closing costs are probably north of $40 in total. And then my expectation is that we would hold back somewhere between $50 million and $75 million dollars for CIs and capital improvements at the asset level. So if you pull out $100 million or $120 million from the $700 million of excess proceeds and you take our share, and you're talking about $300 million, $275 million that we would be able to distribute to ourselves and you know some to our partners obviously to fund the remainder of our development pipeline that we have as well as you know future development pipeline. Michael Bellaman : Can you give me a range on leverage level at $2.3 billion that you've targeted and trying to figure out how to leverage the asset is to get the rate that you were able to lock in? Michael LaBelle : I would say that the leverage is low, look this is fully investment grade institutionally price loan at these credit spreads. You know we haven't completed an appraisal yet, but there's certainly been an analysis of it and you know our view on how we finance these assets is that you know we want to maintain a reasonable amount of leverage, but we want to put sufficient capital on the assets so that we are borrowing at very, very attractive rates, and it's unity kind of get up into you know beyond the kind of BBBs on the CMBS into the DDs you start to get into a credit spread that it significantly higher than what we can borrow from the corporate side. So we kind of shy away from that. So the LTVs for investment grade, CMBS kind of range depending on the characteristics of the asset, this asset obviously has great cash flow characteristics, long term leases and still has a lot of built in growth, because of the below market in place leases. Michael Bellaman : Great, thank you. Michael LaBelle : Yup. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick with Capital One. Tom Lesnick : Hi guys, good morning. My first question has to do it's just general activity with the GSA and the contractor community, I think you guys mentioned one lease with the GSA and then conversations with the contractor of VA 95, but can you comment overall about what kind of optimism you're seeing in that community, and it's way ended now that Trump is approaching 100 days. Owen Thomas : Ray you want to take that. Raymond Ritchey : Sure. There's still a lot of people waiting on the sidelines, I can't tell you how many tenants at Annapolis Junction which is our project up near NSA that have proposals from us contract appended. So first of all, I want to confirm that it's our belief that the budget will get resolved this week and have minimal impact of any on the real estate market, so that should not be concerned. But there's still a tremendous amount of demand on the contracting side especially in Intel and defense, we think that those sectors will come back very strong under Trump Administration. Life sciences, social services maybe not so much, but fortunately with our focus in Northern Virginia we're in really good shape to take advantage of a recovery market there, but the headline is still a tad uncertainty, but the prospects look very good for increased demand on the contractor side. Tom Lesnick : Appreciate that. And then one last one on Colorado Center, I believe you mentioned that one of the remaining few spaces had been leased subsequence at quarter end. Am I correct and understanding that there's just once space left? Owen Thomas : Yes, there is one block. And we have - we could do that we could do a deal there tomorrow on that space we're just trying to make the right decision in the last piece of space. Tom Lesnick : Got it. That's helpful thanks guys, appreciated. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jed Reagan with Green Street. Jed Reagan : Hey, good morning guys. Can you give us an update on the entitlement process at the Oakland residential side and then does that deal signal that you may be interested in Oakland office eventually? Douglas Linde : Bob? Robert Pester : We are fully entitled on the open side as of a couple of weeks ago, and we've looked in downtown Oakland, but before at office opportunities that I just don't see it is something that we would have an interest in at this point. Jed Reagan : Okay. And separately you mentioned that New York City leasing tempo of loss views accelerating, I mean to what extent you think that's a function of overall market health improving or are those more BXP's specific factors and then would you say market rents are falling for spaces above a hundred bucks a foot in New York at this point? Owen Thomas : John you want to take that? John Powers : I think the market has been pretty flat here, the availability rate didn't move in the first quarter, move one tenth of 1% in Manhattan and the leasing velocity was up just a shade from the 12 year average, so it's pretty flat. Jed Reagan : And about the sort of high end market rents any changes you're seeing there? John Powers : Yeah, I think there's more - there's a little more interest in the high end market rent and there has been, I think that the sticker shock that was there or year or two, is not necessarily they know, but it's all on the margin. Jed Reagan : Okay, appreciate that. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Aslakson with Stifel, Erin, I apologize. Erin Aslakson : No worries. Yeah, so good morning. Quick question on, I heard the commentary, I guess preliminary commentary on 2018, when do you expect same store NOI growth is actually start pick up for BXP? Owen Thomas : I think that our same store growth has continued to be positive. The cash same store was over 4% in 2016, it's a little bit less based upon our projections in 2017 because we're - we've got this big rollover that we mentioned, that Doug mentioned we've got basically we're going to lose $30 million from year-to-year. So there's other growth in the portfolio we still believe we're going to have positive rental rate growth obviously in 2017 and also in 2018 and just going to be more moderate. And I think that the cash growth actually in 2018 will outstrip the GAAP growth. We've built in a lot of these early renewals that we've done where in California, the Embarcadero Center and Cambridge that we've kind of been blending in that had 2018 expiration. Cash rents are going to start to hit that in 2018, so I think the cash will be better in 2018 than the GAAP picture. But if you think about 2% down kind of starting, I mean again we're going to be positive, but until we release that 399 space, which we believe won't occur, won't hit the books until 2019, I think seeing real acceleration beyond kind of more of an inflation level is going to be difficult. But we did comment that we anticipate the $110 million to come from the hand full of assets, which is again only eight or nine assets, I mean $110 million is about 7%, so we are expecting 7% growth just from that select group of asset over a two and half year approximate period. And then there's the rest of the portfolio that obviously is going to grow at some level. So if you kind of look out through that whole period I think we will see good, good same store growth it's just again a little lumpy because the expirations and when they are. Erin Aslakson : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS. Nick Yulico : Thanks. Couple of questions, Mike I was wondering if you could give a little bit more of a feel for when you talked about the development NOI that's going to coming in 2018, 2019 there being a split kind of an early sense of what that split might look like? Michael LaBelle : This is hard for me to say right now, I mean I think what I said was $25 million to $30 million is signed leases that we have a good projection for when those tenants are going to take occupancy. So we feel very confident about that. There is additional leasing that we should be able to get done in 2017 more tenants that will need to be an occupancy in 2018, I think will do some more leasing at Salesforce Tower for example for tenants they need to be an space sometime in 2018, but some of those tenants are going to be in 2019. We're talking the tenants that have kind of both requirements and again we can't book revenue until this energy is in a new development. And if you look at the residential property, so we've got 600 plus or minus units to deliver we're delivering them in the first quarter of 2018, our expectation is there is a 12 to 24 month lease up timeframe for that type of residence of development obviously the expenses for residents of development you have to kind of experience them early on. So I would think that we're probably going to get 25% to 30% of the NOI out of those residential developments in aggregate in 2018, and then the rest will come in 2019. So those are kind of two of the bigger development that we have, 888 Boylston Street is going to be basically going to be end of 2017 and there's only 4.5 left, that I think that we should be at the lease that and get occupancy sometime in 2018, those are the big one. Nick Yulico : Okay. That's helpful. Just last question you also you talked about it could take some additional near term expiring space back I assume you meant that 399 Park. Based on what that possibility is today, what would the financial impact would that be specifically would this create another adjustment down in your same store NOI guidance if you did this? Michael LaBelle : I think it could I mean that's why I said it. And we to the extent that we can get the tenant to pay the full amount of rent. So we get the space back and we get start to work on this space, we may elect to do that, if we think is going to help us lease this space on the back side of this more quickly. So obliviously we have our rule that we don't include termination in common same store, and we do that because it can be more volatile, and we want to get that with the same store is, but in situations like this unfortunately feel away. So we try to be very clear about the ins and outs, because it's not a reduction in the overall revenue that we're going to be getting or expected to get in 2017 is just into the bucket. Nick Yulico : Right. Any square footage amount you can give us, so you can now put a parameter on this. Michael LaBelle : There could be another couple hundred thousand square feet. Nick Yulico : Okay. Michael LaBelle : As we get closer to the expiry. Right I mean in the expiry of these leases that are in August and September they're get less - they're less terminations,/ is just like time. Nick Yulico : All right. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey, Good Morning. Mike, so just continue on the 2018 conversation. You had outlined cap interest coming off next year that's going to cause the GAAP interest rate to increase. From a GAAP perspective is not a cash, but from a GAAP perspective. Should we expect the NOI coming from those developments to equally offset the cap interest or is there going to be drag so that as word revising our models or updating them we're probably going to see a negative impact as more cap interest comes off versus GAAP contribution from NOI from the developments next year? Michael LaBelle : I mean the developments are generating a yield as around 7%. So it's well in excess of what our capitalized interest rate is with the currently around 4%. So that won't be a drag, it'll be an improvement. Alexander Goldfarb : .: Michael LaBelle : So I'm going to Bryan Koop answer that question relative what we did with eagerly at the Prudential Center, which I think he'll give you some contact of what we're doing in our some of our assets? Bryan Koop : Yeah. So we are consistently seeing the customer, the tenant looking at power of how do they attract your talent to their location, and the restaurants and the total mix of not only the base is a building, but the entire neighborhood is becoming more important and like never before we've seen companies do analysis on this in terms of what that mix is about the demographics of the neighborhood, and how they're going to use it in their strategy in talent. But comes right on with the response that we've received from the repositioning of the Prudential Center with the addition of Eadly [ph] versus the food court we had before, which was absolutely a strong performer, one of the best in the country the response from our customers has just been really outstanding from all our existing clients. We're seeing the same thing at the hub as well where they focus on the geography of neighborhoods right, and with our additional anchor that are going out today we're seeing increase in terms of what does that play in terms of how they're going to use the office space. We have one particular user who's very focused on the fact that we landed Live Nation. They see it as a place that they can further events and again the track talent for their customers for their internal purposes. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. But from your perspective a Marquee brand versus I mean Eadly does high volume by the economics to you the same or it's better with an Eadly type versus a more formal Marquee type? Douglas Linde : I don't know what the economics of a blue concept are exciting that's what you're describing. But I can tell you that high end restaurants have exceedingly high upfront costs and there's so there's a long payback associated with achieving or returning as opposed to a more I don't know you to use the word and kindly but a pedestrian kind of a concept. So as an example we are talking about more of a food all at six in avenue and I would expect that the investment will be far different than the kind of investments that would be required for three or four or five Michelin star restaurants, and the revenue will obviously be different and the return in the early period of time will be significantly different as well. Owen Thomas : What Doug saying about our key versus what their brand name, that more pedestrian. Each situation is different, but what we've seen here is that the desire by our client than this we have a lets we have a top chef below their space isn't necessarily as important as only think the bulk of their population wants. I'll give an example, so we have earls coming to the Prudential Center the response by earls which is a chain out of Canada has been just outstanding from senior executives that are top firms at the Prudential Center, and it doesn't have to be that Marquee top chef to get a result that you're looking for creating a great place. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay, that's helpful, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Thanks good morning. I just wanted to clarification on your guidance change, I realize now a few items cancel each other out, but excluding those items you still have a 5% gain from the debt extinguishment, but your guidance for the full year only increased by $0.01, so it looks like the guidance overall decline on your core business, can you just clarify that? Douglas Linde : So the gain on our debt extinguishment is simply accelerating the fair value interest that we would have already gotten had we let that loan run through its natural maturity of October 1st, so that was in our guidance, we were expecting to get it in the third quarter, because it's simply the fair value component of our interest expense. So as I said the GM building has an interest rate of 6% on a cash basis, but on a GAAP basis the interest rate is 3%, so we have the positive 3% that we put in every quarter to bring it to fair value. So now that we are going to pay off the loan in June, we have to accelerate the rest of that piece, because it's sitting on our balance sheet, so it has become at the positive. So it's really just timing from third quarter to second quarter that's all of it. John Kim : Okay, got it, thank you. At Salesforce Tower appreciate the updates on the leasing interest, and just wondering if you still feel comfortable with the building being fully leased upon completion as they did a few quarters ago. Michael LaBelle : As I've said, we've got good activity, I don't know it would be fully leased by completion, but I think we'll be well along by the end of the year. John Kim : Okay. And then Owen, I think you've discussed at a recent conference being more reserved about selling your prime assets in being market timers at this time in the cycle. Can you just elaborate on why this is the case particularly as you see potentially more discrepancy between private and public market valuations? Owen Thomas : Yeah, well a couple of dimensions to that, I mean first is capital need you know you've seen our leverage ratios, we just completed $4.5 billion of financing we've put away our unfunded development capital need with this and have created capacity for additional investment our overall leverage levels remain low, so we don't have a need per se for capital right now. And then as we look at the market, I talked about this in my remarks you know we are - we don't see a big spike in interest rate in the near term, we're continuing to have sluggish growth. We're certainly expect at some point to have an economic and valuation cycle for real estate, but I think the timing of that is right now, it is difficult to divine and from what we see you know we continue to believe we're going to have a constructive operating in capital market environment for the - at least for the near to medium term. So for all though and I talked a little bit about where pricing is in our lack of desire of taking on new assets that these you know flourish cap rates. So for all those reasons you know we haven't done any what I'd call major asset sales. We've been selling $200 million, $300 million of assets a year but we haven't done a major asset disposition since the north just joint ventures we did a couple years ago. John Kim : And you mentioned the sale potentially of suburban assets in D.C. and Boston, any update on New York, suburban New York? Owen Thomas : No we are not actively in discussion selling anything in New York, in the New York area at the current time. John Kim : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : We have time for one final question, and that question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi. Manny Korchman : Colorado Center, the that you mentioned or talked about, are those contingent on redeveloping the property and what's your sort of plan redevelopment budget for the properties? Douglas Linde : None of the leases that we have signed are contingent on doing anything from a legal perspective. We have an expectation that we've set with our tenants that we're going to do the right thing by the property and we've shown them the conceptual plans and then the architectural changes that we're going to be making and we've told the city of Santa Monica we can tend not doing these things, and we're going to get this stuff done you know sometime in the next 12 plus months, and it's somewhere between $12 million to $20 million probably is that sort of big picture ballpark redeveloping budget. Manny Korchman : Thanks. And then on Salesforce Tower, I think you mentioned amongst the potential tenants set co-working companies, can just give us an update of view on how you think about co-working in sort of a user space especially in trophy asset like that? Douglas Linde : We have been a supporter of the co-working platforms, we have a handful of leases with we work and we have been in discussions with other operators. We have consider - we consider that co-working phenomena for lack of a better word as positive for the office markets, these companies have aggregated demand from individual users that we as a major landlord have a more difficult time doing direct leases with, they've aggregated this demand and created significant net absorption in most of the markets where we operate. And so we think it's been a positive for us. And then lastly, we think the tenants when they're in our building actually are positive for the building. We think they create energy and activity around the space and we've been positive about it. We continue to monitor the industry carefully, there are evolutions going on, some of these groups are doing more business with corporations, as opposed to support a larger users rather than individuals and we're certainly monitoring that and we are considering additional leasing with some of these groups and some of our assets. But again the good example Bob you might want to comment, we work is in 535 and we think which is a brand new building we completed a couple years ago and we think it's been a positive. Robert Pester : Yeah, they actually refer to that as their flagship in San Francisco, and it's been extremely positive on both the building and the surrounding marketplace still looking, now looking at space where to cross the street at 560 mission, because they can't get any more in 535, because it's fully leased. And the experience we have at the minute in a Embarcadero Center which has been very short, because they just opened earlier this year has been nothing short of phenomenal, they leased out major blocks of spaces to companies like Twitch and few others and actually are potentially looking at more space in Embarcadero Center. Manny Korchman : Thanks very much. Operator : I would now like to turn the call back over to our host for closing remarks. Owen Thomas : Okay. Thank you thank very much for you time and attention at Boston Properties. Operator : This concludes today's Boston Properties conference call. Thank you again for attending. And have a good day.",

During the question-and-answer portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, Senior Executive Vice President and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks. Owen Thomas : Thank you, Arista and good morning to everyone. On current results, our FFO per share for the quarter was $0.05 above our prior forecast and $0.05 above Street consensus, due primarily to operational outperformance. We also has a result increased the midpoint of our full year 2017 guidance by $0.04. We\u2019ve leased approximately 2.8 million square feet year-to-date in our portfolio. This includes 926,000 square feet in the second quarter and approximately 1.3 million square feet of leasing already in the third quarter, including a renewal of Estee Lauder at the General Motors Building, as well as lease with Marriott, which commences the development of their new headquarters. Our in-service office portfolio occupancy increased to 90.8%, up 40 basis points from the end of the first quarter. We had another quarter of strongly positive rent roll ups in our leasing activity with rental rates on leases that commenced in the second quarter up 18% on a gross and 28% on a net basis compared to the prior lease. Lastly, year-to-date, we\u2019ve raised significant new capital and either commenced or secured nearly $1 billion in new developments, the office components of which are fully leased. So moving to the economic environment, the tepid yet consistent growth of the U.S. economy continues and as a constructive force for our business. U.S. GDP growth picked up in the second quarter, as current estimates are 2.6%. The employment picture also continues to be healthy with 222,000 jobs created in June and the unemployment rate steady at 4.4%. Though the Fed has hiked rates three times since December and continues to signal more is coming, the capital markets are diverging as the ten year U.S. Treasury remained low at 2.3% and has dropped approximately 15 basis points year-to-date, and 10 basis points since the end of the first quarter. Given continued muted growth low inflation and the uncertainty associated with Federal stimulus and tax cuts, we are not overly concerned about a sharp rise in the long-term interest rates and anticipate for now a continuation of reasonably healthy operating and financial market conditions. Given the growth in the U.S. economy, the office markets where we operate have positive demand and healthy activity, but are in relative equilibrium given additions to supply. Job creation in our five markets grew 2.1% over the last year versus the national average of 1%. In the CBDs of our four core markets and West L.A., net absorption year-to-date is 1.3 million square feet or 0.2% of stock, while additions to supply year-to-date have been 2.2 million square feet or 0.3% of stock. Asking rents rose 2.6% in the first half of 2017, while vacancy stayed flat at 8.1%. Our leasing activity remains active with pockets of strength, though concessions are rising in specific market. In the private real estate capital market, our commercial real estate transactions year-to-date through July are down 20% and a little less for office, but there continues to be a strong bid from both domestic and non-U.S. investors in size for high quality office assets in our core markets, and the international sources of capital continue to rotate geographically. Cap rates have remain stable for high quality office buildings in our portfolio generally in the low 4% range for stabilized properties. Once again, this past quarter several significant office transactions were completed above replacement costs. And some of these examples are in Santa Monica, Arboretum Courtyard, a 147,000 square foot office building is under contract for $1,030 a square foot and a 4% cap to a domestic real estate adviser. Also in LA, 9665 Wilshire Boulevard is a 171,000 square foot office building located in Beverly Hill, sold for $1,035 a square foot and a 4.1% cap rate to a domestic REIT partnered with non-U.S. capital. Moving to Boston, 75 Arlington and 10 St James in the Back Bay, which collectively comprise 825,000 square feet were sold for $816 a foot and a 4.3% cap rate to a Japanese investment firm marking its first U.S. real estate investment. Lastly, in Washington DC, 900 16th Street and 1101 New York Avenue were sold for $1,150 a square foot and around a 4% cap rate on a blended basis to a partnership of non-U.S. investors. The pricing for 900 16th Street is $1,254 a square foot, which represents a new high in pricing for Washington DC. So let me bring all this together and discuss our current capital allocation posture. On the positive side, economic growth, job creation and leasing demand are steady with no visible catalyst for correction and interest rates appear benign at least in the near-term. In addition, private capital demand remains strong for high quality office assets in our market. On the risk side, supply is increasing in a handful of our markets with rising tenant concessions, and there is the continuing backdrop of macro risk, including global hot spot and unpredictable outcomes from Federal Legislators. We therefore remain cautiously constructive and will continue to invest capital selectively in new development and existing assets that we can improve. However, the risk tolerance bar continues to be raised, we are requiring material preleasing for new development and keeping our leverage relatively low in the event of a correction and a resultant more robust opportunity set. And disposition decisions are driven by achieving attractive pricing for non-core assets. So moving to the execution of our capital strategy and starting with acquisitions, we completed a small 96,000 square foot bolt-on purchase for $16 million of one of the few office buildings we don\u2019t own at Carnegie Center at an attractive price and something that we can efficiently manage. We are looking for new investments in all our four core markets as well as LA given our desire to build on our presence in that market. As an aside on acquisitions, Mike will talk about a financing we\u2019re completing on Colorado Center, which was appraised for $1.2 billion as part of the financing process. We bought a 50% interest in the property the valuation of $1 billion just over a year ago. On dispositions, this past quarter we sell the building and related site on Shattuck Road in Andover, Mass in two transactions for total proceeds of $17 million. This asset is non-core and has a remote location relative to our Suburban Boston portfolio. We have a small number of non-core assets either in the market or planned for sale in the Washington DC region and Suburban Boston, our target for dispositions for 2017 remains at approximately $200 million. Our development activity remains robust, we delivered reservoir place north of 73,000 square foot redevelopment in Waltham, Mass, where we have a letter of intent with a full building user. We commenced 145 Broadway, Akamai\u2019s 485,000 square foot headquarters at Kendall Square in Cambridge and MacArthur Transit Village of 402 unit residential high-rise located adjacent to the MacArthur BART station in Oakland, California. And last week, we signed a 720,000 square foot lease with Marriott to commence their new headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland. We own 50% of this project with a local landowner. These three deals alone represent $815 million in new investment for us at a projected cash yield of approximately 7% and the commercial component is essentially fully preleased. Further, we\u2019ve made significant progress advancing a 300,000 square foot anchor lease commitment for our 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue development in Washington DC and are working on multiple build to suite leased opportunities precisely own in Northern Virginia. These transactions could add over 1 million square feet of leasing for 2017 and several significant investments to our development pipeline if completed. At the end of the second quarter, our development pipeline consists of eight new projects and two redevelopments totaling 4.7 million square feet and 2.9 billion in our share of projected costs of which $1.5 billion has been funded through the end of the second quarter. Our projected cash NOI yield for these developments remains in excess of 7% and the preleasing of the commercial component increased 12% in the quarter to 66%. So to conclude, we continue to be confident about our prospects for growth and ability to create shareholder value in the quarters and years ahead. We\u2019re making good progress on our clearly communicated and achievable plan to increase our NOI by 20% to 25% by the year 2020 through new development and leasing up our existing assets from approximately 90% to 93%. This growth excludes our recent new business wins and potential new investments for which we have significant capacity. So let me turn it over to Doug. Doug Linde : Thank you, Owen. Good morning everybody. I\u2019m going to start, just a little bit of color on our same-store statistics. So we had a pretty healthy increase as Owen described in that same-store portfolio. And remember, those are the leases that commenced this quarter, those are not necessarily leases that were signed this quarter. So let me just give you a color on that pool. So in Boston, there was about 370,000 square feet in the same-store, in the Putnam transaction, which we completed over a year ago at 100 Federal Street is finally coming into play. Again it\u2019s sort of one of those things where we talked about a repositioning we talked about leases that were signed and we had to be patient about when that revenue was going to come in, but the revenue is there. In San Francisco, there\u2019s about 230,000 square feet from Embarcadero Center, and it\u2019s really just a continuation there of all the renewals and relocations that we\u2019ve executed over the past 12 plus months, where we\u2019re seeing those roll ups of between 40% and 50% on a gross basis and in excess of 60% on a net basis. In New York City, there\u2019s about 300,000 square feet and that includes \u2013 actually a deal that we did back in 2014 at 601 Lexington Avenue with a major law firm, which again had a big increase and it\u2019s showing up this quarter. And then Washington DC which was on the negative side, there\u2019s about 127,000 square feet of space in Northern Virginia and the biggest deal there was actually a law firm renewal that was done in the beginning of 2016, where there was a pretty small downtick, it was about $0.65 a square foot and that lease had 2.5% escalators and it\u2019s for 12 years. And remember, all of these numbers that we\u2019ve described are the first year rent versus the last year rent on a cash basis. So to the extent, there are GAAP increases which there are in virtually every one of our leases those are not reflected in these same-store numbers. If you look at our TI numbers, they popped up a little bit this quarter too. And I think that\u2019s the trend we\u2019ve been seeing. The construction industry continued to be very busy in all of our markets and its resulting in increased in base building we budget those accurately. And it\u2019s also impacting tenant improvement installations. Tenants are investing more capital on the improvement and we are investing more capital in their spaces. This is an across the board reality in San Francisco, in Boston, in New York City, in DC, in Los Angeles, and it\u2019s urban and suburban. And I\u2019d say, it\u2019s a result of three factors. First, higher production costs, which is costing more because people are very busy. Two, there are increase code related issues, Title 24 in San Francisco being the easiest one to describe. And then third, we\u2019re competing in all of our second generation space with new construction, and new constructions typically offer significant amounts of tenant improvement and it\u2019s just part of the supply dynamics that we are dealing with across the board. So in some cases, we\u2019re increasing our allowances. In some cases where prebuilding space which we\u2019ve described to you before, and in other cases, we\u2019re providing turnkey installations. Rents and other concessions, however, really have been pretty steady over the past number of quarters. I\u2019m going to start my regional comments this morning, in San Francisco with Salesforce Tower. So last quarter, we announced a 100,000 square feet of leasing and I discussed active proposal that we were talking to with a number of tenants. Well, guess what? In the second quarter, we leased another 175,000 square feet brings us to 1.135 million square feet leased, 82% and we are in lease negotiations on five more floors totaling another 116,000 square feet. And then last week, we received offer on another 4.5. To current discussions involved law firms and co-working firms and private equity firms and hedge funds and private foundations and venture capital firms and even some sovereign wealth advisors. If we complete the deal just in lease negotiation will be left with two 10,000 square foot spaces and floors 51 through 56, a 130,000 square feet, or it will be over 90% leased. The available space is priced at over $100 growth. Now in spite of all the talk over the past year about the overhang of the new construction in San Francisco, the overall market continues to improve. While there haven\u2019t been any blockbuster deals Amazon this quarter took another 175,000 square feet, Cloudera took 55,000 square feet, Airbnb expanded again bringing their net absorption just this year to 250,000 square feet. And we are aware of five active requirements in excess of 100,000 square feet in the market, and they are all focusing on new construction since it\u2019s the only large block option. Sublet space inventory has shrunk. The top 25 sublet spaces make up about 625,000 square feet and there are only two spaces above 50,000 square feet. And this compares to 1 million square feet in the second quarter of 2016, a big reduction. We tracked more than 20 deals with rent over $80 a square foot gross this quarter and the new construction pricing is high 80s growth and up. Last quarter, I said that the story to follow in San Francisco, CBD will be the continued demand growth and tenants respond to the price of new construction. Tenants are accepting the higher pricing in the market. We completed nine deals for 73,000 square feet of office leasing at Estee this quarter and we have three more full floor deals in negotiation and we have active proposals for another six floors, including the space set to expire in 2018 from Bain Capital or Bain consulting that\u2019s moving over to Salesforce Tower by the end of this year. We completed a 62,000 square foot deal at Colorado Center this quarter bringing our committed space to 93%. We have proposals ongoing on the last piece of space there, so I\u2019ll tell you that our view of the overall leasing velocity in the LA market particularly in the West LA market has moderated. There were very few large deals completed in the second quarter and the same tenants are in the market with the same availabilities in play. Our repositioning plans are close to complete and we are working with the local permitting authority with a goal of commencing construction on the amenities work by the end of this year. Shifting to the other side of the country in Boston. We\u2019ve made significant progress on our availability at 120 St. James and 200 Clarendon. In the second quarter, we signed 83,000 square feet of leases and since the beginning of July, we\u2019ve signed another 51,000 square feet and has 54,000 under negotiation, all of the space at 120 St. James is committed. We\u2019ve executed our first prebuilt at 200 Clarendon on the 45th floor, which will be completed in the third quarter and we are in lease with a second user. Down the Street at 888 Boylston Street, during the quarter, we completed the leasing on all of the remaining retail space, 17,000 square feet, and additional leasing in the office tower, leaving us with 30,000 square feet in this 417,000 square foot project nine months after opening, 92.8% leased. While there are not a lot of large exploration driven requirements of the Boston CBD at the moment, we have seen the growth activity picking up. Amazon grew by 150,000 square feet in July in the Seaport, and we are in active dialogue with six tenants, four from the technology industry, ranging from 30,000 square feet to 175,000 square feet for the 175,000 square feet space at the Hub on Causeway that we\u2019ll deliver in the first half of 2019. Overall, in the CBD market, rents are stable though depending upon the condition of the space, the landlord\u2019s contribution to tenant improvements has risen as I said at the outset of my comments. In our Waltham suburban portfolio, our largest executed transaction involved the recapturing and releasing of 40,000 square feet at our Reservoir Place asset. We also have, as Owen said, a lease under negotiation with a tenant for the entirety of 73,000 square feet at Reservoir Place North. We continue to see growth from life science companies, and we actually completed another 25,000 square foot expansion at Bay Colony with an organization that has grown from 13,000 square feet in sublet space in 2001, to a 150,000 square feet of direct space today. We responded to two new additional build to suit proposals at our CityPoint landholdings, though as Owen stated, our leasing thresholds are very high. If we are able to land a major lease commitment, this would add to our investment pipeline for 2020 and beyond. And if any of these projects go forward, the rents will be in excess of $50 a square foot gross. We\u2019ve commenced the marketing of that 100,000 square feet of space. We\u2019re going to getting back in Cambridge in early 2018 Our 2.4 million square foot portfolio, which is 100% leased, is dominated by large users. We\u2019ve received a very strong interest from co-working operators that find us location on the top of the Kendall Square T station to be an ideal spot for small tenant opportunities, which are lacking in Cambridge. We are exploring this news for a portion of the space. This space also has its own dedicated entrance if a user is interested in expressing its brand. The Cambridge office and lab markets continue to be very tight and expensive, forcing tenants to consider alternative locations like The Hub on Causeway project. Last quarter, I commented that our large tenant at the General Motors Building with a 2020 lease exploration had been actively evaluating their alternatives. Well, as Owen stated, Estee Lauder has made a long-term commitment to the building. In addition to the location, and the view, the building infrastructure, we believe one of the strong selling points for Estee Lauder was our ability to provide flexibility as they move forward with rebuilding and replanning their space, facilitated by the use of two swing force. They are currently in 295,000 square feet and have committed to 220,000 square feet with rights to expand. This was an important transaction for the building as it is a great tenant and at limits available space for some time. As I\u2019ve said before, the issue with the high-end market is not pricing, it\u2019s the depth of the market, and there is a more high-end the space entering the market as we speak. This quarter, we were encouraged as there were more relocations over $100 than there have been in recent memory. Now this is due directly to the new construction on the west side at the Hudson Yards and 1 Manhattan Place \u2013 excuse me, 1 Manhattan West, which complete the deals. During the first half of 2017, so the first six months, there were 30 deals at 19 distinct buildings, above $100 a square foot in starting rent and the average deal size increase to 20,000 square feet. There were five deals between 40,000 square feet and 90,000 square feet. Size of deals is still the issue. With the execution of our renewal at the General Motors Building, our biggest exposure in New York City are at 399 Park Avenue and 159 East 53rd Street. Activity at 399 Park is good. We have leases in negotiation right now for 66,000 square feet and we are in discussions with three medium sized financial service organization between 150,000 square feet and 250,000 square feet of our low rise space, which encompasses 250,000 square feet. Obviously, we can do all those deals. And we have a steady stream of tours and proposals on the individual tower floors, which begin on 18th in the building up to the 35th floor. Our low rice space on Park Avenue is priced in the mid-$80s to the low-$90s. So repeating what we said last quarter, in 2017, we\u2019re collecting $31 million from the expiring tenants at 399 Park. We\u2019re going to get the space back during the third quarter. We\u2019re making proposals. We\u2019re going to lease the space consistent with these economics I just described, but in every case, we\u2019re going to have to demolish the existing improvements and occupancy will not be until 2019, which will mean that this space will not generate any revenue in 2018. And it\u2019s going to show up as a decline in our same-store growth. Same-store, just repeating it, from last quarter. At 159 East 53rd Street, which is currently out of service, the new curtain wall is being hung as we speak, go over to Third Avenue, look up and you\u2019ll see the brand-new building. We\u2019ve made a number of proposals on 195,000 square feet of office space that is being rebuilt and will be delivered in early 2018. We\u2019re optimistic that we will have signed leases in place contemporaneously with the base building completion, and revenue recognition will be in 2019. We are marketing a new building with a great new enhanced window line, mechanical plant and tremendous outdoor space on each floor at a great relative value. Often during the summer, we describe a hiatus in activity as vacations impact individual transactions. This year, we have pushed through this pause in San Francisco, we pushed through in New York and we pushed through in Boston. So the summer slowdown seems to have impacted the DC spot market, in the CBD. In the DC CBD, the spot leasing market continues to be a challenge with significant available inventory in existing assets, and as a number of brokerage reports have pointed out, availability from new construction of partially leased buildings. Concessions are generous and additional GSA, contractor, law firm or other private- sector demand has yet to pick up in DC. Nonetheless, this quarter, we had a lot of activity in DC. The majority of it on the operating front was focused a Capital Gallery, which is a 99% lease building and where we did six renewals totaling 53,000 square-feet. And in Northern Virginia, where we completed 120,000 square feet including a full building, user 63,000 square feet in our VA 95 Park and in Reston Town Center, we have 45,000 square feet of leases under negotiation on vacant space and Discovery Square, which expired in June, about 38 days ago. Under negotiation, all of it, which would bring us to 98% leased, and there are number of technology companies looking to expand in Reston Town Center just as the defense contractors have begun to retreat. As evidenced by the Marriott lease, the progress we\u2019re making at 2100 Penn, with a 300,000 square foot lead tenant as Owen described, and a recent build to suit requirement in excess of 600,000 square-feet that we are hotly pursuing in Reston Town Center, our new transaction activity is a robust as it has been in our history and it involves very little speculative space. I want to conclude my remarks this morning with a portfolio comment. We\u2019ve been conducting major capital reposition activities across the portfolio that have impacted the availability of significant space. 399 Park, 601 Lexington Avenue, the General Motors retail, the Prudential Center retail, 120 St. James, Reservoir Place North and 181 Spring Street in Suburban Boston and 100 Federal Street. These assets are all part of the revenue bridge, operating or development, and we\u2019ve been discussing them over the last 18 months on a continual basis. Moving forward, the only buildings in the portfolio planned for future repositioning, but not actively underway, where our activities could impact tenant space are at Metropolitan Square, where we own 20%, and 1333 New Hampshire. Both of these buildings are in Washington, DC. The buildings have known 2019 lease expirations. Our current share of the annualized NOI impact from the future rollover in lease assets is $13.8 million, pretty modest. We will continue to make other capital investments across the portfolio as we rebuild generators, and elevator controls, and lobby finishes, put new roofs on, and all other kinds of building systems, but there are no building project in the portfolio where we expect tenant spaces to be impacted. At the end of the quarter, we\u2019ve now completed leases that we expect will add $69 million to our goal of $160 million, which includes all the releasing at 399 Park, for net growth of $111 million of annualized in-service NOI, our revenue bridge. And finally, we\u2019ve added 350 basis points to our development pipeline, where 70.6% where we anticipate a 2020 annualized incremental NOI of $242 million stabilized versus year-end 2015. With that, I will turn the call over to Mike. Mike LaBelle : All right, thanks, Doug. I\u2019m going to get started with a discussion of our results for the quarter. Our top line revenue growth was strong this quarter and is reflected in an increase in net operating income from the portfolio of $14 million, net of termination income. We gained 40 basis points of occupancy, which included significant gains at 100 Federal Street and 200 Clarendon Street in Boston, 601 Lexington Avenue in New York City, and our Suburban Washington, DC. Portfolio, mostly from leases that were signed in previous quarters and what revenue has now commenced. This also shows up in our same-store results for the quarter, with our share of same property NOI up nicely at 3.9% versus last year. In June, we closed our $2.3 billion 10 year refinancing of the GM Building at a GAAP interest rate of 3.64%. The repayment of the existing debt resulted in a noncash gain on debt extinguishment this quarter of $14.6 million. This was in our guidance and I spoke about it last quarter. It is from the acceleration of fair value interest and is now cleaned up and will not recur. Since it is related to a consolidated joint venture, our share is $9 million with the offset in our noncontrolling interest line. As I mentioned last quarter, the loss of noncash fair value interest will increase our interest expense going forward. In 2018, we project our interest expense to be between $390 million and $410 million compared to our 2017 guidance of $355 million to $368 million. This represents an increase in interest expense of $38 million or $0.22 per share in 2018 at the midpoint, which you should reflect in your models. For our earnings, we had a solid quarter and reported funds from operations of $0.67 per share, this was $8.5 million or $0.05 per share above the midpoint of our guidance. $0.02 per share of the improvement is due to expenses that were deferred to later in the year. So we anticipate only $0.03 per share will flow into our full-year\u2019s results. The remaining $0.03 was comprised of $0.02 per share of earlier than projected leasing, primarily in Boston and San Francisco. At 200 Clarendon Street in Boston, we continue seeing uptick in activity and are successfully converting proposals to signed leases and getting tenants in the occupancy as quickly as we can. Similarly, at Embarcadero Center, we gained occupancy again this quarter and executed another full floor renewal with a strong rental increase. In Mountain View, we signed a lease with a tenant for immediate occupancy at a 70% increase in net rent over the prior lease. None of the outperformance in the portfolio this quarter is from termination income. We did record $11.5 million in termination income this quarter, being our share, this is primarily from terminations at 399 Park Avenue and the GM Building that we discussed last quarter and were in our guidance. The other increase to our anticipated results this quarter was in development and management services fee income where we recorded revenue approximately $0.01 ahead of our expectations. The variance was mostly in-service income and development fees. Based upon the leasing that we completed this quarter and that we project for the remainder of the year, we\u2019re increasing our assumptions for 2017 same-property NOI growth by 25 basis points at the midpoint to between 2% and 3% compared to 2016. Most of the improvement is coming from leasing velocity in San Francisco, and Boston as well as in New York, where we completed our early renewal with Estee Lauder. Although our current same-property growth pace exceeds 3%, as Doug described, we expect our same property growth will decelerate in the back half of 2017 due to lower occupancy from lease expirations at 399 Park Avenue. Most of our second quarter uptick in leasing came from new leases with free rent periods and early renewals with rent increases, which flow into our straight-line rent. This is reflected in our new guidance for straight-line rent and fair value rental income of $75 million to $85 million for 2017 that represents an increase of $5 million at the midpoint from last quarter. We\u2019re also increasing our guidance for development and management services income based upon the results of the second quarter, and we now project $30 million to $33 million in fee income for 2017. We have not changed our guidance range for interest expense, though the financing of Colorado Center this quarter is dilutive to our 2017 earnings and will reduce our income from joint ventures by about $4 million. The loss is partially offset by expected lower borrowing under our line of credit and higher interest income. The anticipated net loss to our budget is about $0.01 per share. So in summary, we are increasing our guidance for 2017 funds from operations to $6.20 to $6.25 per share. This is an increase of $0.04 per share at the midpoint that represents an increase of $0.04 per share from improvement and portfolio NOI, $0.01 per share from management and development services income, offset by a reduction of a $0.01 per share from our financing activities. As Owen mentioned, we added three additional developments to our pipeline, totaling nearly $815 million of new investment, and I want to make a few comments on our funding capacity and plans. Our development pipeline now totals $3.1 billion and has additional funding of approximately $1.5 billion remaining. At quarter end, we had a cash position of approximately $500 million and we have full availability under our bank line of credit and term loan facilities totaling $2 billion. Last week, we closed a 10 year fixed rate mortgage on our Colorado Center property located in Santa Monica. The loan in the amount of $550 million bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.56%. The property is held in a 50-50 joint venture, it was previously unencumbered and we received a distribution of $250 million, adding to our liquidity. Since acquiring Colorado Center in the third quarter last year, we have leased more than 300,000 square feet, bringing the leasing up from 65% to 93%. Our LA team has done a phenomenal job and we\u2019re significantly exceeding our original underwriting projections both in terms of lease-up timing and stabilized projected income contribution. Upon full lease-up and stabilization, we project an unleveraged cash return of approximately 5.8%, and after rolling up existing below-market leases, we expected to get to the mid-6% range. With long-term financing at 3.56%, the equity returns are even stronger. We have now accessed over $4.8 billion in the debt markets in 2017, demonstrating the strong support we have in the capital markets. We also expect to raise approximately $225 million of construction financing, representing our share to finance a portion of the cost of The Hub on Causeway and Marriott developments. Overall, we have plenty of resources in the form of liquidity and debt facilities to fund our pipeline. As we\u2019ve discussed in the past, our balance sheet is strong with relatively low leverage, that provides more than sufficient capacity to fund these as well as additional investments without raising common equity. Lastly, I just want to remind everyone that we\u2019re having our investor conference this fall. The date is on October 4, and it will be in Boston with a formal presentation starting at 8 :00 AM. We will also be doing property tours on the afternoon of October 3, and hosting a cocktail party that evening. You should have received a save the date already and a formal invitation will come out soon. We look forward to seeing you all there and as always, we appreciate your support. That completes our formal remarks. Operator, you can open up the line? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first call is from Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors. Jed Reagan : Hey, good morning guys. You described a lot of good recent in pending leasing activity at Salesforce Tower. Just curious if you can explain briefly the drivers behind pushing that stabilization date out a couple quarters? Owen Thomas : So the \u2013 on the stabilization, we have gotten, I guess, information from Salesforce on their planned phasing in. So as the building gets closer to completion, it\u2019s going to complete at the end of this year. Salesforce has basically six phases of work that they are putting into place and we can start revenue recognition on the space when they complete their TIs. So basically, they\u2019re going to start moving into the building at the beginning of 2018 and over six quarters, they\u2019re going to phase in to these six phases. So the last quarter of their move-in is going to be at the beginning of the third quarter of 2019. I would say that they are paying us cash rent before they\u2019re actually physically occupying the space because the way the lease works, there are set dates in the lease for each phase when they have to start paying cash rent. So we\u2019re actually going to be putting a bunch of deferred revenue up on our balance sheet as they pay cash rent and before they occupy, because we can\u2019t recognize the revenue. And then when they occupy each phase, we will recognize all that deferred revenue over the term of the lease. So our cash will be coming in earlier. It\u2019s just we won\u2019t be able to recognize it as revenue. Jed Reagan : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And you mentioned that pre-leasing requirements have increased recently for developments. I was just wondering if you can quantify where you\u2019d peg that today versus maybe what that threshold was, say, a year or two ago? Owen Thomas : So, Jed, it\u2019s hard \u2013 it\u2019s Owen, it\u2019s hard to give you an exact number on that, it depends on a lot of factors. What\u2019s the size of the building, what\u2019s \u2013 how active is the current market, what is the kind of leasing dialogues that we\u2019ve had, but as an example several years ago, we launched 535 Mission in San Francisco on a spec basis, we probably wouldn\u2019t do something like that today. And also as an example, most of the transactions that you\u2019re seeing us do today, they\u2019re substantially, if not fully pre-let, so we\u2019ve announced recently Akamai\u2019s headquarters, fully pre-let, Marriott\u2019s headquarters, fully pre-let. We talked about the 300,000-foot anchor commitment were trying to secure at 2100 Pennsylvania. So it\u2019s hard to give you an exact number. It depends on a lot of factors but we want significant pre-letting in our new developments. Doug Linde : I\u2019ll give you a real life example. So the tenant that Owen and I described is looking at Reservoir Place North at 72,000 square feet. They asked us for proposal for the next building at City Place and we said we weren\u2019t going to give them a proposal because 73,000 square feet or 80,000 square feet or a 200,000 square-feet building was not enough for us to deem it appropriate to start that building. Jed Reagan : Okay, appreciate that. I\u2019ll hop back in the queue. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS. Nick Yulico : Thanks. Just turning to the Estee Lauder renewal. Could you just explain when the shrinkage of this space happens and what year? And your comfort level in taking back 75-year \u2013 and your comfort level in taking back 75,000 square foot of space along with, what type of package you have to offer to keep the tenant rather than have him go to somewhere else. Let\u2019s start with that. Thanks. Owen Thomas : So let me start, and I\u2019ll let John Powers chime in. So Estee Lauder has a lease through at the beginning \u2013 middle of 2020, and that lease is remaining in place. And they signed an extension on 220,000 square feet and we will begin to provide them with some swing space sometime towards the end of \u2013 or middle to end of 2018. So they can start their work. And I\u2019ll let John keep going from there. John Powers : Well, I don\u2019t have too much to add. They may in fact increase their square footage over the next period of time. We don\u2019t really know that. They have flexibility take significantly more space. Nick Yulico : Okay. As far as the rents, I mean, is this rolls down on rents flat. How should we think about that? Owen Thomas : You should think about it as follows. When we bought the building back in 2008, there were two leases that were very, very, very billable market, and one of them was Wild [indiscernible] the other one was Aramis, Estee Lauder. We were able to keep both of those tenants in the building and we will be able to offer those tenants really attractive lease rates. That were probably lower than what we would charge a tenant that was taking 15,000 square feet or 20,000 square feet or 30,000 square feet in the building. And so it was a win-win situation for both parties. Nick Yulico : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Just last question, you talked about some of the activity at 399 Park and the low rise of 601 Lex. Sounds like the activity there is pretty good. How do you feeling about getting leasing announced before year-end for the bulk of the space for both buildings? Owen Thomas : John, you want to take that one. John Powers : Well, we have some good prospects. We\u2019re trading papers. So we\u2019re optimistic we could have it done by recent, but maybe it will drift into the first quarter. These are big leases and after you have a term sheet. It\u2019s typically 90 days to get it signed. So we do have good interest. On the three prospects that Doug mentioned, the 399, they\u2019re all on different time frames. So one of them probably would certainly be done by the end of the year, the others probably would be in the first quarter. Nick Yulico : Okay. Thanks, John and Doug. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Thank you. So I just wanted to dig in a bit into your comments around the high-end of the market, you mentioned pricing is not an issue, but the depth and maybe just private tenancies. Can maybe just give a little bit more color. What you seen exactly at some of the higher-end space, maybe a 399 Park and some of the tenants that are looking at some of the floors that are at vacant in the GM Building? Mike LaBelle : Do you want to start with that one, John, and then I\u2019ll add to color this time? John Powers : Sure. I think we have some good activity at the GM Building. It\u2019s funding in the market is, as Doug said, pretty flat in terms of the pricing today and it\u2019s more pressure on the TI dollars, but there\u2019s a pretty good activity. So we have a floor and a part of the floor available. So we have two or three tenants looking at that at GM. We had two or three tenants looking at the four floors, or more than four floors in the Tower at 399. Owen Thomas : And again, just \u2013 this is sort of my market commentary. There are lots of tenants, who are prepared to pay in excess of $100 a square foot to be in, as I described, the 19 buildings that may deal this quarter. The challenge in the market in Manhattan is that, the tenants that\u2019s paying well in excess of $100 a square foot is a smaller tenant. And so, it\u2019s a question just of the size of that pool relative to the amount of square footage that is coming onto the market over time. And I think that is where the rubber is going to meet the road. They will continue to be, and we believe lots of single floor and two-floor deals, and 30,000 or 40,000 or 50,000 or maybe even some 80,000 or 90,000 square foot deals. It\u2019s hard to imagine there being hundreds of thousands of square feet of leases from single tenants in the marketplace that well in excess of $100 a square foot in the current environment. Doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t happen in three or four years, but in the current environment, it\u2019s not what we\u2019re seeing. Vikram Malhotra : Okay, and just to clarify, on the GM \u2013 on the Estee Lauder space, you mentioned that there will be some swing space. Are they taking some lower floors while you redevelop some stuff? Can you just maybe walk us through how that will work? Owen Thomas : Sure. Go ahead, John. John Powers : Yes. You noticed, I think it was last quarter, we took some termination income at GM. And we did that to provide swing space for Estee Lauder to swing through the building. They need at least two floors to rebuild as they go through their space. Vikram Malhotra : Okay, great. So thank you. John Powers : So just understand this process will take them about three years to do and they\u2019ll be making decisions on which brands to keep there, and which ones to move. So we won\u2019t know the answer to exactly how much of space they take for probably another year or two. Vikram Malhotra : But as of now, they\u2019ve committed to roughly 50,000 left space, is that correct? Doug Linde : That\u2019s correct. We\u2019ve given them a lot of flexibility, because they are repositioning their whole portfolio and they have a number of different brands and there\u2019s a lot of completed decisions that they have to make. So we decided to go in early, get this deal done and allow them the flexibility. So the commitment they\u2019ve made is the minimum commitment. That maybe the final commitment, but as I said, things will change over the next two years. Vikram Malhotra : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi. Manny Korchman : Good morning, everyone. Maybe if we turn to LA for second, it\u2019s a market that you\u2019ve had some successful leasing at Colorado. What do you see in terms of other opportunities there and would you stay sort of in that West LA submarket or would you go a little bit broader? Owen Thomas : We have been \u2013 as we\u2019ve mentioned in prior calls, growing LA is the priority for us. We\u2019ve had initial success with Colorado Center and we want to build on our toehold there. We have been looking and studying a number of new investments, some of them have been offered by intermediaries, more broadly, and some of them are more private discussions, some of them are acquisitions, some are development and redevelopment. We\u2019re continuing to track \u2013 I\u2019d say probably a little under half a dozen things at this point. The perimeter is more or less consistent with what we\u2019ve been talking about, which is more West LA, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Hollywood, El Segundo, those kinds of areas as opposed to downtown. And \u2013 but again, as we did with Colorado Center, we\u2019re not trying to grow just for growth\u2019s sake. We want to, in addition to growing, we want to make money for shareholders in the process and we feel, we did that on Colorado Center and that\u2019s our bar for new investments. Manny Korchman : Great. And then maybe, Mike or Doug, if we turn back to your slides that you presented at NAREIT, has anything changed in terms of timing there either from the contribution from the developments or sort of the expectations of when NOI kicks in from the projects outlined there? Doug Linde : Honestly, Manny, the only thing that\u2019s changed is the developments have kind of gone up slightly I think it was 241 and not 242 or 243. So it\u2019s gone up a little bit, because we\u2019re, honestly, we\u2019re able to achieve more income from Salesforce Tower than we originally thought we would. But, again, we were very circumspect about the specific timing of our development in terms of when it was going to be put in services and it\u2019s the first question this morning addressed that the timing of the income from the largest tenant at Salesforce Tower is just \u2013 it\u2019s not in our discretion. We know when the cash is coming in, but we don\u2019t know when the revenue recognitions are going to occur. Manny Korchman : Got it. And final one for me, just \u2013 could you share your thoughts on your Street retail, it\u2019s been a big topic of discussion and especially maybe as you\u2019re leasing up at 399 and other places? Doug Linde : I\u2019ll make one comment, and then I\u2019ll let John respond. So our Street retail is a pretty de minimis amount of square footage, although it has a lot of value. And we have a couple of spaces on Madison Avenue, and we\u2019re in reasonable constructive conversations with a few tenants there. And then the bulk of our retail in Manhattan is about food and \"lifestyle choices\" AKA, what we\u2019re doing at 601 Lexington Avenue with our repositioning of the retail there, and I\u2019ll let John describe what\u2019s going on there. John Powers : Well, we\u2019re repositioning the base of 601. As you know, putting in a food hall there and we\u2019re out to lease with a, let\u2019s say, a master retailer that would run the whole food hall for us. I guess, the retail in Manhattan, as Doug said, we don\u2019t have a big exposure. Clearly, the market is soft in many places. Manny Korchman : Thanks everyone. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Craig Mailman : Thanks, guys, good morning. Just curious, your commentary about TIs going up, kind of rents staying in place. Just kind of curious how that dovetails to the type of yield you guys are expecting on some of these build to suit developments? I mean, where should we expect those returns come in versus maybe 12 to 18 months ago? Doug Linde : Well, we mentioned in our remarks that the new developments that we are adding, we believe on pro forma basis, are going to yield for the company roughly a 7% cash yield. And that has more or less been our target for commercial development. We\u2019ve been through that from time to time, if we have material preleasing, and frankly, we\u2019ve achieved better than that. So I think the yields have stayed relatively constant. I think that\u2019s logical given where interest rates have stayed. I think of the development, the risk bar has really gone up more on the preleasing \u2013 with our preleasing requirement, which we talked about further. And then on residential, the yields are probably 100 basis points lower in general, when we look at new development. Craig Mailman : That\u2019s helpful. And then, just turning to kind of co-working space, you guys \u2013 WeWork\u2019s at about 83 bps plus what\u2019s coming on at Dock72. And you guys are talking about, I\u2019m also looking up in the Boston area or co-working tenant looking up in the Boston area. Just curious, how much exposure you guys want to that kind of vertical from a tenant perspective? Doug Linde : Let me try and describe the answer to your question in a couple of ways. So number one, we are affirmatively believers that co-working and the aggregation of small tenant users is a good thing for the market, and it\u2019s a good thing for our properties. And so we have been very accommodative and outward in terms of being receptive to those types of users. There are a whole host of these organizations now. Some of them will not be successful and some of them will be very successful. Obviously, we have a position with WeWork, from a tenant perspective, we don\u2019t, we have no investment and we work as an equity owner and we\u2019ve had that question before. And we have been pretty dogmatic about modest amounts of tenant improvement exposure there and high-quality secure deposits in the form of LCs and guarantees of their mothership in various cases. So we are \u2013 obviously, there are limited they\u2019re not full guarantees. So we are thoughtful about our exposure and there\u2019s clearly a limit in terms of how much we would have, no different than I think, there\u2019s a limit and how much we would have lot of different types of tenants, particularly ones that are in their more nascent origination as opposed to a company that\u2019s been around for 15 or 20 years. And so we\u2019re just going to \u2013 we\u2019re going to be thoughtful about it. Craig Mailman : Great, thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Jamie Feldman : Great, thank you and good morning. Owen, I want to go back to your comments on the capital markets. And I think you said bids are rotating geographically. Can you just talk about that rotation, especially as it relates to China, which has been in the news, maybe pulling back capital? Thanks. Owen Thomas : So, Jamie, this is a hard thing to exactly quantify. A lot of this is anecdotal and what we see and who\u2019s doing which deals where and what we hear about. But, couple of things : one, as I mentioned, I do think the bid for the kinds of assets that we own remains strong. And I gave bunch of examples of things trading this quarter in the low 4s cap rate. And a lot of them traded to non-U.S. investors. When I talked about rotation, I do think there have been a few adjustments over the last quarter. Again, this isn\u2019t \u2013 a switch doesn\u2019t flip. These happen slowly over time. We\u2019re seeing, for example, more Korean investors today, I would say, than we saw a year ago. I would say, we\u2019re seeing more Japanese investors in the market today, than we saw, say, versus a year ago. So \u2013 and then some of those investors that we saw a year ago, again this isn\u2019t always the truth \u2013 or always the case, but for example, investors from Canada maybe are slightly less active, or the Middle East. Again, there are examples of transactions to being completed by all these groups. But that\u2019s just our feel in terms of the tenor of the market. In terms of Chinese investors, look, I am aware as you are of probably specific examples of where capital controls are put in place and specific investors have been taken out of the market. But I do think there are lots of examples where Chinese corporations as well as sovereign funds have made major investments. These are in the U.S. or globally over the last quarter. So I don\u2019t think there is a general wall that\u2019s been built up around China that has cut off outbound capital. And I think, if anything, the Chinese capital has been quite robust over the last quarter. Jamie Feldman : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And I guess just very recently, is there a change in that or \u2013 in China, specifically? Owen Thomas : I can\u2019t tell you that I think there\u2019s been a change in regulation in China that\u2019s cut off capital flows. I could \u2013 I know of \u2013 or I\u2019m aware \u2013 I think we\u2019re aware of some specific examples of investors that have suddenly gone out of the market. But there are definitely other Chinese investors that are actively pursuing transactions, not only in the U.S. but all over the world. And that capital remains flowing. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then, Mike, I appreciate your color on how to think about interest expense for next year. And you guys seem like you\u2019re trending ahead of your core guidance. So as we think about 2018 \u2013 and I know you made some comments on the last call, you\u2019re kind of starting in the hole with 399 Park, but any thoughts on how the core outlook looks for next year in terms of same-store and if the better than expected trend from this quarter and the rest of the year is going to help that? Mike LaBelle : I don\u2019t think anything necessarily changed from last quarter. On the same-store, the challenge we\u2019ve got is that the 399 Park drop is 250 basis points of our same-store, effectively. So we\u2019re going to have growth in the rest of same-store, and the question is how much is it and how far can it overcome that 2.5%. And what I said on the call last quarter was that I thought it was going to be positive. So it was going to be able to overcome the 250 basis points. I don\u2019t want to get more specific than that because there\u2019s a lot of time between now and then, and we\u2019re not going to give guidance until next quarter. Jamie Feldman : Okay, thanks. That\u2019s helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Vincent Chao : Hey, guys. I think most of my questions have been answered here, but just maybe a quick one on the guidance. Given the beat in the quarter versus your own expectations and excluding the deferred expenses, I guess I\u2019m just wondering with the $0.04 increase based from the straight line being a little bit higher on better leasing activity, curious why it seems like roughly $0.02 upside versus 2Q expectation wouldn\u2019t have maybe flowed through a little bit more, resulting in a little bit more upside. Or was some of that just earlier timing of expected leasing? Mike LaBelle : I think it mostly was earlier timing. We project that these things are going to happen. We don\u2019t know exactly the date. And when you get a renewal done 45 days in advance of when you expected a quarter ago and you get to start straight-lining that 45 days earlier, it has an impact, but then it\u2019s in our model already for the fourth quarter, right, that, that was going to happen. Same thing with kind of new leases. When you get something done 60 days early, it\u2019s still in the back half of the year of happening, but it\u2019s just happening a little bit sooner. So that\u2019s most of what it is. Vincent Chao : Okay, thanks. I don\u2019t know if I missed this from earlier, but did you provide the cap rate for the Carnegie acquisition? Owen Thomas : We didn\u2019t. So it was a competitive and attractive cap rate. Doug Linde : I mean, I\u2019m going to speak off the top of my head because I don\u2019t remember. I want to say that the building was like 80-somewhat-percent leased, and it was in the mid-7s. Vincent Chao : Yes. Doug Linde : So I think our stabilized number was somewhere close to 8.5% or 9% once we complete the leasing. Vincent Chao : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Alexander Goldfarb : Good morning. Doug, Doug, can we go back to \u2013 on Midtown versus the far West Side. You\u2019ve spoken about the price point and the value space that existing buildings provide versus new construction. But clearly, if tenants are looking for efficiencies or modern space, the new construction is better, and yet the existing buildings are still winning tenants. So are there other things that the existing Midtown buildings offer apart from just value space that keeps tenants going \u2013 coming back versus going for the more efficient floor plates? Owen Thomas : John, do you want to start with that, and I will add on? John Powers : Sure. Look, every tenant is different, and every tenant has its own buyer characteristics. We\u2019re dealing with tenants now that have no interest in going to the West Side at all. We have other tenants in our portfolio that went to the West Side. So the Midtown core is still where most tenants want to be. It\u2019s \u2013 many of the tenants that went to the West Side couldn\u2019t find space in the core because of the size of their requirement. So the core of Midtown is very, very stable. And furthermore, the West Side is almost completely leased up now. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay, okay, that\u2026 John Powers : So those are not opportunities. When a tenant goes into market, like for example, BlackRock went into market, where are their opportunities? They only had two opportunities in Manhattan. There was no space that size on the East side at all. So they had opportunities to stay in their location. They were split. They wanted to consolidate. They could have gone downtown or they could have the building constructed in the West Side, and that\u2019s what they chose to do. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. But John, I appreciate that. And then the second question, just with all the news around MTA in infrastructure and the need there, I know you guys have the MTA site in Midtown. Are there other opportunities where \u2013 for public partner \u2013 public-private partnership where you guys can help sort of with capital needs that the MTA may have and get additional development sites or redevelopment sites? Owen Thomas : So Alex, a couple of things I want to mention. So on that, there is nothing \u2013 there should be, I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s anything identifiable that we\u2019re actively working on, but there are multiple examples in our overall corporate portfolio where we\u2019re working with transportation authorities on building great buildings. A great example is the Back Bay development where we\u2019re working with MassDOT and don\u2019t forget the origins of the Salesforce Tower where the Transbay authority that is building a major transit hub in San Francisco. So this theme of public-private partnership is very prevalent in our portfolio, and I would assume it would continue. I think the other thing I just want to touch on, on your question about Midtown versus Hudson Yards and what\u2019s the tenant reaction that we\u2019ve had, certainly, I agree completely with John on a lot of this is the tenant\u2019s preference on where they want to be. I think the other things that I would mention that are important that we hear is transportation infrastructure. When you think about the Grand Central Terminal, all the subway lines, the transportation infrastructure that exists in Midtown is, again, very, very competitive. And also, I think the other thing that\u2019s happening, and obviously, we\u2019re contributing to this, walk around Midtown. Look at the amount of scaffolding and the work that\u2019s going on and the \u2013 and a lot of this work is improving the infrastructure that\u2019s there. And we\u2019re doing it with our own amenities and our own buildings, and I think you\u2019re seeing other landlords all over the district doing this. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. Thank you, Owen. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rob Simone with Evercore ISI. Rob Simone : Hey guys, good morning. Thanks a lot for taking the question. A bunch of mine have already been answered already. But just on Colorado Center real quick. I read a couple months \u2013 about a month ago or so that HBO is giving back about 130,000 square feet. I think it was in 2019. Can you guys comment on that? And I think, Mike, you cited a mid-6% is a stabilized yield. Does that expiration impact that yield at all? And if so, by how much? Thanks a lot. Doug Linde : So let me comment, and I don\u2019t know if Ray is on, but he can \u2013 I\u2019ll let him add if he\u2019s available. John Powers : Ray is on. Doug Linde : Great. HBO has a lease expiration in the beginning of 2019. We are not aware that they have made any conclusive plans to leave. There have been a lot of articles that have been written about their interest in going to a new development that is yet to start. I\u2019m not a soothsayer, but I think it\u2019s going to be awful hard for a new building to be built that hasn\u2019t started yet for them to be in it by that time in 2019. So I wouldn\u2019t put a lot of confidence in everything you read and the timing of everything you read. Ray Ritchey : I would also add that if HBO does move out, we have tremendous internal demand within Colorado Center that would back fill the HBO space with a substantial uptick in the current space with HBO. So we\u2019re not at all concerned. The HBO space is probably the best space in Colorado Center, and it\u2019s probably 30% to 50% below market. So we\u2019re \u2013 it\u2019s not going to be \u2013 if they do depart and then, as Doug said, that\u2019s still in question. In the event, that will be greeted with great glee with the current tenants in the Center. Rob Simone : Thanks a lot guys, really helpful. Doug Linde : And just one last comment on that, just \u2013 they are the tenant probably with the least mark-to-market \u2013 the lowest rent and the highest mark-to-market that we have in the Center. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel. Erin Aslakson : Hi, good afternoon, guys. So Erin Aslakson here for John. Quick question on Estee Lauder lease. On a net effective basis, I guess, in 2020 this will commence, obviously, rents are actually increasing quite a lot. Would that be a fair assumption? And can you quantify? Doug Linde : So Erin, I don\u2019t want to be [indiscernible] or snarky about this. I don\u2019t feel like \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re not in a position to describe what is happening with a specific tenant. The rent will be going up from where it is today, but after that, it will bleed through and you\u2019ll see it in our portfolio statistics and you\u2019ll see it in our same-store, but we\u2019re not going to break out what a specific tenant is paying. Erin Aslakson : Okay. That\u2019s fair. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Blaine Heck : Thanks. Just one for me, probably for Doug. Appreciate the color on the rent spreads on the 1.3 million square feet of commenced leases during the quarter, but obviously, that\u2019s a little backward looking. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing for the spreads on the leases that were executed in the quarter and whether we should expect any trend, up or down, for spreads in the coming quarters and into 2018. Doug Linde : I can tell you \u2013 I don\u2019t have a list in front of me as we speak, but the majority of the leasing that\u2019s been done this quarter at the 200 Clarendon Street Building has a dramatic uptick in rents. We were \u2013 we took space back at somewhere between $35 and $45 a square foot, and we\u2019re getting rents between $55 and $80 a square foot. So that piece is dramatic. The \u2013 all the Embarcadero Center leasing is going to be consistent with the leasing that we\u2019ve been doing over the past few quarters where we are generally getting somewhere between a 40% and a 50% gross markup in our leases on a fixed rate basis. And I think I said this before, in the leases that we are doing at 601 and at 399, it\u2019s a pretty flat running-in-place kind of perspective. So as you look forward, we basically said we need to work really hard, and John and his team are working really hard to put us in a position where we currently are. We\u2019ve got close to 500,000 [indiscernible] we\u2019ve got an average rent there that\u2019s just over $105 a square foot. And that\u2019s where we intend to probably achieve on a lease-to-lease basis when that leasing is done. So we have a modest uptick there, but that\u2019s where the bulk of that $50-plus million is going to come from. Blaine Heck : Very helpful, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Thanks. Looks like we\u2019re about a year away from the initial occupancy of Dock72. Can you just provide an update on leasing prospects there? Doug Linde : John? John Powers : Well, this deal is up to seven on the West and up to the 12 out of 16 floors on the East. You are right, we\u2019re about one year away from occupancy there. We have no specific deals on, but we\u2019ve covered the market pretty well. We\u2019re bringing a bunch of brokers out there next week. And I think this is a product that will lease once people see it. We have no land costs, so we\u2019re at an advantageous position. John Kim : Is transportation the major issue at this point as far as getting tenants comfortable with that? John Powers : Well, there are a lot of issues. It\u2019s in Brooklyn, so that\u2019s a different market. There is a transportation issue. We do have the ferry now, and that\u2019s going to be a big plus. John Kim : Okay. And then you provided the appraised value at Colorado Center, I was wondering if you had done the same thing with the valuation of the GM Building. Mike LaBelle : We didn\u2019t, but it\u2019s probably available at $4.8 billion. John Kim : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Rich Anderson : Thanks for sticking with us. Doug, regarding your comment on the bridge and the fact that you only have two remaining tenant-disruptive redevelopments planned that haven\u2019t commenced yet, I think Metro Square and 1333 New Hampshire, I\u2019m curious, do we view that as an indication that this huge pace is truly going to decline in terms of redevelopment? And I guess, how important is it to BXP as a publicly traded company with investors, analysts kind of patiently waiting to see this incremental activity decrease over the next three years, thereby allowing the full cash flow potential of the company to come through? Is that important to you? Or is it kind of out of your hand like HBO lease, Colorado Center, then you kind of have to do something? I\u2019m just curious where your mind is about how anxious you are to see that cash flow really start to matriculate to the bottom line. Doug Linde : Yes. So I think it\u2019s a really good question. I\u2019m sorry, you had to wait this long for it. It\u2019s very important to us. We \u2013 and I\u2019m \u2013 we\u2019re going to spend a lot of time talking about this when we all get together in October. We have effectively repositioned the portfolio for a long, long time. You don\u2019t do things like what we\u2019re doing at 399 Park Avenue or the plaza of the General Motors Building or the flagship at the Prudential Center or the re-skinning of a suburban office building that was built in the 1980s. You don\u2019t do that every 10 or 15 or 20 years. You do it every 30 or 40 years. And we happen to be in a position where we decided that this was the right time to do all of these things because of the lease expirations. Buildings like the 120,000 square feet that potentially is expiring at Colorado Center are basic tenant improvements jobs, not repositioning jobs. We are doing the amenitization and the repositioning of that site outside of worrying about the disruption of tenant spaces because it\u2019s not going to impact them. It\u2019s only going to impact the amenity spaces. So we feel really good about where we have positioned the portfolio for a long, long time. We are going to have lease expirations, and some of them will be a little bit lumpy. When I look forward to sort of 2019, as an example, there are a couple of big ones in Washington, DC, but the GSA buildings, there \u2013 these are hardened buildings with unusual tenants in them. We fully expect the tenants to re-lease those buildings. There\u2019s going to be virtually no capital put into them. Things like that are going to happen in the portfolio all the time. But in terms of taking a building out of service and doing something major to it that impacts our ability to lease the space, we basically push through it all. Rich Anderson : Okay. If you just allow me, it was mentioned \u2013 I think John mentioned West Side is now fully leased, but a lot \u2013 or many have not made the physical move yet. So is there a risk optically that Manhattan office vacancy rates could come down even though you know it may be coming when companies actually make their physical move to the West? Is that something that you have to manage the message a little bit on? Owen Thomas : Well, let me pick that up. So we look obviously at the leasing statistics very carefully, and we obviously are aware of the supply that\u2019s coming out, and we try to think through the timing for the new supply and what the market will look like at that time. And as you know, we\u2019ve taken various actions in our portfolio, actually, several years ago in anticipation of the current supply that\u2019s coming into the market. So I think that our view is if absorption \u2013 net absorption continues at what it\u2019s been over the last few years that we think that \u2013 of this new construction in New York generally can be absorbed. I mean, you\u2019re going to have tenant movements in new districts, and there may be some pockets of strength and weakness, but in general, we think the market can absorb it. The issue is will that net absorption continue, and that is more economically driven. I think New York is a vibrant and a competitively successful city and will continue to be that way, but if we have some kind of downturn in the overall economy and the net absorption goes away, that will be more harmful to the market, I think, particularly given this new supply that\u2019s coming on. Rich Anderson : Right. And I guess it\u2019s just, right now, tenants are in two places, the pre-leased number in the West Side and the existing numbers point East. And that\u2019s my only point. But I guess it\u2019s just that it\u2019s happened at such large scale that\u2019s why I asked the question. And then the last question for me is the Princeton investment, I recognize this is relatively small in all scheme of things, but does that make your total investment there more marketable? And do you ultimately see Princeton as a larger kind of portfolio, a sale candidate down the road? Or are you committed long term to Princeton? Owen Thomas : So we \u2013 you have to break Princeton into two pieces, first of all. You have Carnegie Center and Tower Center. So you look at \u2013 all our statistics are on a Princeton basis, but those two assets are very different. Rich Anderson : Okay. Owen Thomas : Tower Center is more challenged. We\u2019ve had more difficulty in leasing it, and I would describe it as non-core. If you look at Carnegie, different story. It\u2019s perennially in the high 80s, low 90s. In terms of occupancy, we have a strong tenant base there, a lot of international pharma companies. We\u2019ve made significant investments at Carnegie, improving our amenities and improving the park overall. And so this \u2013 when this property became available, there\u2019s only three or four assets within the park that we don\u2019t own, and we thought this was a very logical acquisition. It\u2019s small. Doug talked about the cap rate earlier. We thought it was attractive. And of course, we can very efficiently manage it and, of course, spread all our spend on the amenities even further into that building. So we\u2019re committed to Carnegie Center. Doug Linde : Yes. I would say that the incremental investment was an opportunistic investment. You have a willing seller in Mack Cali who \u2013 this is our only asset in this marketplace. They have one building across the street left. And the \u2013 we just put major money into re-amenitizing our Carnegie Center assets, and we were \u2013 because we didn\u2019t feel it was appropriate, we were not \u2013 we were prohibiting the tenants of other landlords from using the opportunity set and the amenity spaces that we\u2019ve created. And so we had the ability to opportunistically acquire this asset, introduce the amenity program that we have for all the other Carnegie Centers to this building and hopefully be in a position where we can, because we\u2019re doing that, increase the rental rates in the building in a modest to meaningful way over time as well as maintain higher leasing level. And so we looked at it really on a one-off basis and said, look, it will be accretive to our Carnegie investment over time. Rich Anderson : Good, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors. Jed Reagan : Hey, guys. Just one or two follow-ups. It looks like Midtown East rezoning, they get finalized the next week or two. And just curious to get your guys thoughts on what this means for the market. And then can you just talk a little bit more specifically about your 343 Madison development rights there and kind of what place these plans are? Doug Linde : John? John Powers : Yes. Well, Midtown East rezoning, it\u2019s been hung up for a while. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to have a dramatic impact on the market in the short run. There aren\u2019t any a lot of properties that you can tear down and rebuild with an increased FAR. And a lot of Midtown is only built according to the existing code. And we\u2019re moving forward on the MTA site slowly, and hopefully, we\u2019ll have that tapered sometime early next year. Jed Reagan : What kind of time line should we think about for maybe kicking off that project? John Powers : It would be quite a ways from now. We\u2019d have to go through Europe, so you\u2019re talking about several years. Jed Reagan : Okay, thanks. And just \u2013 I think it was mentioned earlier that concessions continue to march higher across your markets. If you are to strip out the rising construction costs, sort of order of magnitude, how much increase in concessions would you say you\u2019ve seen over the last year or so? Doug Linde : That is an impossible question to answer, Jed. And it\u2019s funny because we\u2019ve talked about it ourselves, which is one of the reasons the concessions are up is because of the costs. So if you\u2019re in San Francisco and Article 24 has been enacted and it\u2019s costing you $35 a square foot more to build out your space, that\u2019s impacting the overall economics of the decision to move and to touch that space. And so it\u2019s impacting the market because it\u2019s just the reality of what you have to deal with. So it\u2019s hard to divorce the two things. In addition, rents have not gone down, and there is more high-end space on the market in places like Midtown Manhattan. And when someone\u2019s paying $125 a square foot, the tenant improvement allowance is $75 a square foot that was sort of market in 2011, is probably not an appropriate number because the rents were a lot lower in 2011. And so there\u2019s a mismatch of concepts that are going on, so it\u2019s impossible to sort of describe what percentage of those numbers are attributable to the inventory issues in the market. John, I don\u2019t know if you have another thought. John Powers : No. I think Doug mentioned it earlier. It\u2019s costing more for tenants to move. That\u2019s the key thing. So the TI packages are up, but the price for the tenant is not down. They\u2019re not getting more because of the increase in construction costs. Jed Reagan : Sure, okay. Appreciate the comments guys. Owen Thomas : That concludes all of our questions. Thank you for your time and attention. We look forward to seeing everyone at our Investor Conference in early October. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s Boston Properties conference call. Thank you again for attending, and have a good day.",

During the question-and-answer portion of our call, Ray Ritchie, Senior Executive Vice President, and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks. Owen Thomas : Thank you, Arista, and good morning. First, I'd like to thank everyone who attended or listened to our Investor Conference in early October. Given that we just completed a thorough review of our portfolio and markets, we're going to focus our remarks this morning on the quarterly results, 2018 guidance and anything else that's new since the conference. On current results, our FFO per share for the quarter was $0.04 above our prior forecast and $0.03 above Street consensus. We also, as a result, increased the midpoint of our full year 2017 guidance by $0.02. We leased 2.6 million square feet in the third quarter, which is significantly above our long-term quarterly average for the period. Year-to-date, we've leased 4.1 million square feet, and are on track for above-average leasing for 2017. Our in-service office portfolio occupancy declined by about 60 basis points to 90.2% from the end of the second quarter, primarily due to the previously-discussed occupancy reduction at 399 Park Avenue. Rent roll-ups in the aggregate for the third quarter on commenced leases were up modestly on a net and gross basis. In the quarter, we also commenced 1.4 million square feet in two new developments that are 100% leased and delivered a 417,000-square foot project. Lastly, we've had a very active and successful year financing our business. Year-to-date, we've raised $5.1 billion in financings and increased our weighted average debt maturity from 4.7 to 6.1 years. Now moving to the macro environment. Economic growth has improved marginally to 3.1% for the second quarter, and advanced estimates for the third quarter are 3%. And though recent hurricanes have had a negative impact on the September job data, unemployment did decline to 4.2%. Consistent with my Investor Conference commentary, tepid but steady economic growth continues, and we're not making any investment or operational decisions based on improvements that might result from current tax reform efforts. Moving to the financial markets. The 10-year U.S. Treasury has had a substantial upward move, rising nearly 35 basis points since early September. Demand for credit also remains robust with tight credit spreads in most sectors. Though we would expect another round of Fed tightening in December and a measured unwind of quantitative easing, inflation remains low at 2.2%, and interest rates are higher in the U.S. than the rest of the developed world. Though we believe interest rates could rise further, we expect to continue to operate in a relatively low and constructive interest rate environment for the foreseeable future. The five major office markets where we operate are, taken as a whole, in general equilibrium. Economic growth continues to create jobs and net absorption of office space, which is currently in balance with new development or additions to supply. Specifically, for our five markets, net absorption for the third quarter was 1.2 million square feet or 0.2% of total occupied space, while deliveries were 1.7 million square feet or 0.2% of total stock. Vacancy remained flat at 8.3%, while rents grew 0.2% for the quarter. Leasing activity remains healthy, with the strongest activity continuing to be in the technology and life science segments. And as a result, San Francisco and Boston are outperforming New York and Washington, D.C. among our markets. Though significant liquidity and a healthy bid still exists for high-quality, well-leased office assets in our core portfolio, office sale transaction volume's down 27% through the end of the third quarter in the United States. I think there are two primary reasons for this decline. First, there are fewer high-quality assets in the market, given more of these assets are now owned by long-term institutional holders. Second, the market has become more exacting regarding asset quality and is requiring higher returns for less well -- located in the less well-leased assets. Notwithstanding the slowdown, once again, this past quarter, several significant office transactions were completed at attractive valuations in our market. In New York, a Japanese property company purchased a 90% interest in 50 Hudson Yards, which is a 2.8 million-square foot Class A office building currently under construction. The price was $3.9 billion or over $1,400 a square foot. The cap rate is not meaningful given the property is currently 30% pre-leased. In Santa Monica, one block away from Colorado Center, Arboretum Courtyard, which is a 147,000-square foot office building, sold for $152 million to a domestic manager. Pricing was $1,030 a square foot and a 4% cap rate. In two separate transactions to the same buyer, 9401 and 9665 Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills are being sold to a domestic REIT partnered with OffShore Capital. Together, the buildings represent over 300,000 square feet, are being sold for $334 million. And pricing is $1,075 a square foot and under a 4% initial cap rate. And lastly, in San Francisco, the developer of 222 2nd Street recapitalized the building for an aggregate value of $530 million or $1,171 a square foot and a 4% cap rate. The asset is a newly-constructed 450,000-square foot office building located in the SOMA District and fully leased to LinkedIn. Our capital strategy posture remains unchanged. We are cautiously constructive on the environment and investing in pre-leased developments and redevelopments that make sense. We do not need to raise equity capital, and are selectively selling non-core assets to continuously upgrade our portfolio. Though we do not anticipate a near-term downturn in the market, we are hedged for such an occurrence, given our low leverage and increasing FFO from developments, both of which should provide us access to capital for the resultant opportunity set. Now moving to our capital activities. In the third quarter, we sold a land parcel in Reston to a major corporate user for its headquarters for $14 million, and we currently have a small number of noncore assets in the market in Washington, D.C. and suburban Boston. Our estimate for total dispositions for 2017 is just under $200 million. Our development activity remains very active. This past quarter, we placed fully in service 888 Boylston Street at the Prudential Center, again which is a 417,000-square foot office and retail building that is 93% leased. We also added to our development pipeline 7750 Wisconsin Avenue in Bethesda, which will become Marriott's 740,000 square foot new world headquarters and 6595 Springfield Center Drive, which is a 637,000 square foot development in Springfield, Virginia fully leased to the TSA. These two deals alone represent $525 million in new investment for us with attractive yield characteristics and no leasing risk. In the predevelopment pipeline, we are close to an anchor lease commitment for 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue and are competing for major corporate users to launch projects at 20 CityPoint in Waltham, 1001 6th Street in Washington, D.C. as well as several major build-to-suit opportunities in and around Reston Town Center. While there is uncertainty whether these tenant prospects can be secured, if we are successful, these projects aggregate 2.5 million square feet of new development; are 100% owned, except for 1001 6th Street; provide initial cash returns consistent with our office development targets; and will be a primary engine for additional company growth beyond 2020. In the third quarter, our development pipeline grew modestly and now consists of nine new projects and two redevelopments, totaling 5.7 million square feet and $3.1 billion in our share of projected costs, of which we have funded $1.7 billion through the end of the third quarter. Our projected cash NOI yield for these developments remains approximately 7%. And the pre-leasing component of the -- the pre-leasing of the commercial component increased 9% in the quarter to 75%. So to conclude, we continue to be confident about our prospects for growth and ability to create shareholder value in the quarters and years ahead. We continue to make good progress on our clearly-communicated and achievable plan to increase our NOI by 20% to 25% by the year 2020 through development and leasing up our existing assets from approximately 90% to 93%. And growth beyond 2020 is now becoming more clear and likely, given the new developments we've added to our pipeline and our progress on predevelopment. Now let me turn it over to Doug. Doug Linde : Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. I've truncated my comments this morning since we provided you with a pretty robust view of the portfolio at the conference less than 30 days ago. Let me start with the mark-to-market comparisons because that's something that everyone sort of latches on to, and that's on Page 42 of our supplemental. So our second-generation leasing statistics. We're really pretty much in sync with all those rollover charts that we provided and are part of our investor package, all available on the website. In Boston, there was about 300,000 square feet of space that we hit the second-generation stat this quarter. The majority of it was in Waltham, our suburban assets, and we were up about 12% on a net basis. In San Francisco, it was a smaller portfolio. It's about 144,000 square feet, and it was heavily weighted to Embarcadero Center, and we were up 24%. In New York City, it included about 191,000 square feet. And remember, I explicitly talked about a roll-down that we were going to see during the quarter on about 38,000 square feet, one of the low-rise floors at 767 Fifth Avenue, and I mentioned that we were moving from $160 to $115. Now that's obviously with no -- very little transaction costs, low TIs, no downtime. And yet we were still only down 4% in New York City with that big rollover, which was down almost 50% on a net basis. And then in D.C., the pool was about 386,000 square feet. And it was dominated by a 15 year, 190,000 square foot renewal with the GSA at 500 East Street, again, very low transaction costs, only $7 of TIs, and that D.C. pool was down about 10%. So let me start with my regional comments. At Salesforce Tower, we received our temporary certificate of occupancy, which is a great milestone. And during 2017, we've now completed 350,000 square feet of leasing. So we are at 1.23 million square feet done on that 1.412 million-square foot building. We have lease negotiations out on 152,000 square feet of the remaining 177,000 square feet. That would bring us to 98% leased. And unfortunately, that means Mr. Pester will not meet his goal of being 100% leased by the end of the year. Every lease we've signed or negotiating is scheduled to commence by the third quarter of 2019. So pretty much in sync with those numbers that we showed you again at the conference in terms of the timing of our deliveries. Turning to the other new construction in the CBD of San Francisco. 181 Fremont is now 100% leased. You heard The Exchange is now 100% leased, and there are leases in progress for 100% of 350 Bush. So that means that Park Tower's 750,000 square foot building, which is likely to be available in late 2018, is it. That is the only new product until 1st and Mission delivers in 2021 and beyond that is under construction in San Francisco. Large blocks of contiguous direct available space are basically absent from the market. This quarter, our 56,000 square foot tenant at 50 Hawthorne announced they were closing their San Francisco office, which is leased at $65 gross. They are negotiating, and as-is sublet for the entire space for basically the entire remaining term, starting rents mid 80s. We will share in the sublet profits. Sublet space inventory is very low, though it's expected that Dropbox will put a large block on the market as part of their transaction. So I guess if you're looking for the less robust view in San Francisco, you'd have to point to the limited growth and activity from the nontraditional technology office users. Yet, we have two law firms at Embarcadero Center that are expanding. And all the remaining leasing at Salesforce Tower is with traditional tenants, and three of those deals at 152,000 square feet are adding space as part of their requirement. In Boston, we completed another 167,000 square foot of leasing at 120 St. James and 200 Clarendon during the quarter and another 60,000 square feet this week. We hope to complete our lease negotiations at The Hub on Causeway for 140,000 square feet of the 180,000 square feet of podium space this month. And we reached agreements with retail users for 36,000 square feet of the retail space. That gets us to 95% leased on all the retail space at The Hub. While there are not a lot of large exploration-driven requirements in the Boston CBD, we have seen some inbound activity and some tech growth continue. During the third quarter, two tenants made commitments to move into the city, one from Needham and the other from Lexington. Both tenants have leases in Boston Properties assets, one for 80,000 square feet that goes through December 31 of '19, and the other for 320,000 square feet that goes through November 30 of 2022. There continue to be a handful of modest-sized tenants that are expanding and exploring new space alternatives in the CBD, and that includes the tenants that we are talking to at The Hub on Causeway. In our Waltham suburban portfolio, our largest lease this quarter involved recapturing and then re-leasing 40,000 square feet at our Reservoir Place asset as well as a 125,000-square foot extension. One of the new build-to-suit proposals at our CityPoint land, as Owen suggested, appears to be moving forward. And if we're able to sign a lease for between 50% and 60% of the space in that building, we will start construction in early '18 and deliver for occupancy in the third quarter of '19. This is about a 200,000-square foot project. As we said at the Investor Conference, the most significant opportunity for high contribution occupancy improvements in the portfolio is in New York City. We completed our space trade at the base of 399 Park, leaving us with a 192,000 square foot block on floors seven, eight and nine. And with the addition of a 10th floor 60,000 square feet that's expiring in 2018, we have a very attractively-priced 250,000-square foot block on Park Avenue at the base of the building. In addition, we completed a lease for the entire 14th floor, 40,000 square feet, and we are in active discussions with multiple tenants all currently in the Midtown for between 65,000 and 250,000 square feet of that low-rise space as well as some 1- and 2-floor requirements for the tower space, where we have 190,000 square feet available. Given the condition of the space and the build out, future executed leases for the space won't run through our income in 2018 and are not part of our 2018 projections, as Michael described. I also mentioned the early lease extensions we were working on in New York City during the conference. Well, we did one of them this week. We completed a long-term renewal with Ann Taylor at Times Square Tower for their 2020 expiration. While there's been lots of leasing on the far West Side, Midtown continues to support major lease commitments. Since the beginning of this year, we've seen 19 deals, over 95,000 square feet each, and nine of those have been new leases, not renewals. If you define the high end of the market as over $100 a square foot, there's been a tremendous amount of activity completed this quarter, as a lot of products on the far west side got leases done. Three leases by themselves totaled over 465,000 square feet. But if you push the pricing thresholds to deals with starting rents at over $135 a square foot, the activity continue to involve much smaller users, 15,000 square feet and under, and there is more high-end space competing for those tenants. Our activities in Washington, D.C. follows three themes. The first is that our franchise has been able to match sites and tenants together to spur an unprecedented series of build-to-suits. Owen said we completed the Marriott and TSA this quarter, and we're working to complete a deal at 2100 Penn. We're in active dialogue at 17Fifty in Reston. We have a large consolidation requirement we're talking to about Reston Phase 3, and we are chasing an anchor tenant for our site at 1001 6th Street, a tremendous amount of activity. All construction would commence upon signing leases. The second theme is the strength in our Reston Town Center market as a real magnet for private-sector contractors and tech tenants. This quarter, we completed 7 transactions for 71,000 square feet of leasing. And we are working on 200,000 square feet, one of which, 135,000 square feet, signed 2 days ago. The third is the highly-competitive leasing market for existing D.C. assets, including the multitude of repositioned B buildings. The good news is that we don't have a lot of this space. The challenge is that there are lots and lots and lots of options for smaller tenants. So summing things up. As of today, we've completed leases that we expect will add $81 million to our goal of $155 million -- that includes the re-leasing of 399 Park -- for net growth towards our $111 million of annualized in-service NOI, our \"revenue bridge. This is up about $12 million versus last quarter. And finally, we added 200 basis points to our development component of our bridge. We're at 73%, where we anticipate the 2020 annualized incremental NOI of $242 million. Now I just want to point out that, that portfolio does not include any of the new leasing that Owen described at TSA or Marriott, and it doesn't include any of the new developments that we will commence on a going-forward basis. So we're trying to keep that pool tight together and describe the $242 million and the percentage of that that's been committed. I'm going to stop here, and I'll let Mike review the quarter, and then provide the assumptions behind our 2018 estimates. Mike LaBelle : Great, thanks, Doug. Good morning. I don't mean to pile onto what Owen says, but I do want to thank everybody for attending our Investor Conference last month. We had great attendance, both in person and via our webcast, and we truly appreciate your interest in BXP. You got to hear from over 30 individuals across all disciplines talk about their projects and their initiatives, and I think it really demonstrates the strong depth and talent that we have in our company. This quarter, on the capital-raising front, we closed two new financings. The first is a $550 million, 10-year mortgage on Colorado Center. The loan bears interest at 3.56% fixed for 10 years, which is very attractive. We also closed a $205 million construction loan on our Hub on Causeway joint venture development. It's priced at LIBOR plus 2.25%, and it will fund all of the remaining development costs for this first phase of the project. Turning to our earnings. Our third quarter funds from operations came in at $1.57 per share. That is about $6.5 million or $0.04 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range from last quarter. Our portfolio generated about $0.01 per share of our outperformance, half from higher rental revenues and the rest from operating expense savings. We recorded $3 million of higher-than-projected development and service fee income, most of which was related to the completion of our services at one of our third-party development projects. We anticipated this income in our full-year guidance, but did not project it to be accelerated into the third quarter. And lastly, we experienced lower-than-expected G&A by about $0.01 per share related to lower health care and professional services costs. We don't expect this to recur. And next quarter, we should return closer to our second quarter run rate for G&A. Our same-property NOI growth in the third quarter from the same period last year was up 3.4%, 2.7% on a cash basis, which was slightly ahead of projection. As we've been forecasting all year, in the fourth quarter, we anticipate our same-property NOI growth to turn negative due to the loss of a full quarter of 325,000 square feet of occupancy at 399 Park Avenue. We are raising our fourth quarter funds from operations projections due to improvement in our portfolio assumptions as well as incorporating additional development services income, primarily related to the commencement of the development of the Marriott joint venture project. Overall, we're increasing our guidance range for 2017 full year diluted funds from operation by $0.02 per share at the midpoint to $6.24 to $6.25 per share. At $6.25 per share, our 2017 growth in FFO will be 3.6% over 2016. This performance is in spite of losing $0.20 per share of termination income and $0.10 per share in the second half of 2017 from 399 Park Avenue. In 2018, we expect a full year of downtime at the building, and we'll have to overcome $0.18 per share of lost FFO. So please keep this in mind as I describe our assumptions behind our 2018 estimates. The income -- the impact of 399 shows up in our same-property portfolio NOI growth. As Doug mentioned, given the fact that we expect this space to be fully rebuilt by new tenants, there will be no revenue on the vacant space in 2018 even after it's leased. This space alone represents a 200 basis point drop on our same-property NOI growth from year-to-year. The remainder of the New York City portfolio is expected to continue to demonstrate growth in NOI, but it will not be sufficient to overcome the loss of income at 399 Park. We do have growth in other parts of the portfolio. And overall, while we expect occupancy at the start of the year to be a low point, approximately 90%, we expect we will build our occupancy and end 2018 with occupancy above 92%. On average, we expect occupancy to be between 90% and 92% for the year. In Boston, we anticipate 200 basis points of occupancy improvement, including completing the lease-up of 200 Clarendon Street and a good portion of our vacancy at the Prudential Center. We will also experience improvement at 100 Federal Street, as Putnam moved into the majority of their new space in 2017. In total, we project our Boston portfolio same-property NOI to be higher in 2018 by between 5% and 7%. We project improvement year-over-year in San Francisco, where we've been achieving strong roll-up in rents on our leasing activity. We project growth in 2018 of between 2% and 3%. Now this assumes we do not achieve any revenue from 80,000 square feet of space that will be vacated at Embarcadero Center when Bain moves to their new premises at Salesforce Tower in early 2018. On a cash basis, our San Francisco NOI growth is projected to be in excess of 6% from the cash impact of all the early renewal activity -- these were 2018 expirations -- that we completed over the past couple of years that has already been blended into our GAAP earnings. In Washington, D.C., our CBD portfolio is stable, and we have minimal rollover exposure there next year. In Reston, where we're currently 97% leased in our 3.6 million-square foot town center properties, we have 200,000 square feet of known move-outs at lease expiration, where we expect vacancy in 2018. We have expanding tenants within the center who will likely take up a portion of the space, but we'll have some downtime that will impact our NOI growth from the portfolio. Overall, we project that growth in 2018 NOI from our same-property portfolio will be higher by between 0.5% and 2.5% on both a GAAP and a cash basis from 2017. Now our projections for cash NOI same-property growth would actually be 100 basis points higher if not for two early renewals we have in New York City. Doug described the first, which was signed this week, and the other is still in negotiation. But both of these deals include offering free rent in 2018 in exchange for long term extensions. They're both good for the portfolio long term. They're NPV positive, as they avoid downtime and mark rents up to market, but they do result in lower cash NOI in 2018. Our same-property assumptions have always excluded the impact of termination income. In 2017, we project termination income to be approximately $24 million. The majority of this comes from two floors at 767 Fifth Avenue and two floors at 399 Park Avenue, both that occurred earlier this year. Our current assumption for termination income in 2018 is between $4 million and $8 million. So we expect to lose approximately $18 million year-to-year. We project strong contribution in 2018 from our non-same-property portfolio. That's comprised primarily of our development deliveries. The incremental contribution from these properties in 2018 is projected to be between $40 million and $50 million. The biggest contributors to this growth are 888 Boylston Street, where we will have a full year of stabilized income, plus the impact of the initial tenants commencing occupancy at Salesforce Tower. It also includes the elimination of approximately $7 million for our share of demolition expenses that we booked this year, but do not anticipate recurring in 2018. We project our income from development and management services to decline modestly in 2018. We project a range of $29 million to $34 million. The reduction is primarily related to our adoption of the new revenue recognition rules from FASB. The modified rules have a negative impact of about $3 million on our 2018 income versus the old accounting method. So, in other words, we're simply losing $3 million of revenue. The last item I would like to cover is interest expense. As we discussed over the last couple of quarters, the refinancing of our loan on the GM Building has a meaningful impact on our interest expense. The accounting for the prior loan included a fair value adjustment that reduced our reported interest expense to 50% of what we actually paid. In addition, we project an increase in our debt next year of approximately $550 million to fund our growing development pipeline. We project funding this from our unsecured term loan facility and our corporate revolver, both of which are currently untapped and have aggregate availability of $2 billion. We anticipate our 2018 capitalized interest to be roughly equivalent to this year, as additional capitalized interest from our new developments is offset by development deliveries of 888 Boylston Street this year and Salesforce Tower and our two residential projects next year. So overall, we project our net interest expense to be between $375 million and $390 million in 2018. This represents an increase of $25 million at the midpoint from our 2017 midpoint. $15 million of this increase is from the change in noncash interest related to the GM Building refinancing. We also project our share of interest expense from unconsolidated joint ventures to be higher by $5 million, reflecting a full year of interest expense from the financing of Colorado Center. So in summary, if you use $6.25 per share for 2017 as a starting point, at the midpoint of our 2018 assumptions, we project an increase of $0.13 per share from the same-property portfolio, $0.26 per share from development deliveries. This is partially offset by $0.10 per share of lower termination income and $0.17 per share of higher interest expense. We project slightly lower fee income, higher non-controlling interest and higher G&A that reduces our projection by $0.09 per share. This results in a midpoint for 2018 projected funds from operations of $6.28 per share and our new guidance range of $6.20 to $6.36 per share. In summary, and most importantly, our portfolio continues to generate growth, and we are projecting strong external growth from our developments. Our projected year-over-year FFO growth would be much stronger if not for the impact of termination income that accelerated 2018 revenue into 2017 and the loss of the noncash fair value interest benefit we've been receiving on our prior loan at the GM Building. Net of termination income, we project our portfolio revenues to increase by approximately 5.7% at the midpoint of our guidance range. Our projections do not include the impact of any acquisitions or dispositions. We currently have two operating properties on the market for disposition. The NOI contribution from these two properties is approximately $0.05 per share. As we expressed during our Investor Conference, we expect stronger growth in the portfolio in 2019 as we lease our vacant and expiring space at 399 Park Avenue and NOI from the rest of the portfolio continues to grow. We also project a substantial increase in the contribution from our development deliveries in 2019 as we anticipate delivering $2.25 billion of our pipeline between now and the end of 2019, with a significant portion already leased. And we expect to continue adding new development investments, as we've done this quarter. That completes our formal remarks. Operator, I'd appreciate it if you could open the lines up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel. John Guinee : I've got a bunch of questions. Let me just ask a couple then I'll get back in the queue. First, if I'm looking at your numbers on Salesforce Tower, is the all-in development cost $766 a foot? And is there any chance that Salesforce Tower will actually be a double in terms of valuation at stabilization? And then my second question is, Marriott doesn't stabilize until 2022. I'm imagining you're trying to tie that to Ray Ritchey's 50th birthday, but why so long? Doug Linde : Well, on your first question, John, on Salesforce, we're not going to try and hazard a guess on how somebody might value the building. I think we generally view that high quality CBD assets that Owen has been describing for, I don't know, the last six quarters or seven quarters or eight quarters have been trading at valuations -- initial cap rates in somewhere between high 3s and low 5s depending upon the rent roll. I think the most interesting thing about Salesforce.com Tower is that it's underleased at this point. There's been so much growth in underlying rents in San Francisco that we have a big mark-to-market in that building. So I think that there's a lot of value creation there. With regards to Marriott, that is simply a question of when their lease expired in Bethesda out in democracy and when we can physically build the building. We are going as quickly as we possibly can, and our hope is to start our foundation work in the middle of 2018, which will allow us to deliver the shell and core to Marriott to build out their TIs in the middle of 2021. Owen Thomas : John, on the sales -- just to add to what Doug said on Salesforce, we've also said that we're going to deliver the building at -- in excess of a 7 yield. And as I've been pointing out, as Doug mentioned, the comps in San Francisco for new buildings are definitely in the 4s cap rate-wise. And per square foot values have been rising. They pierced $1,000 of square foot in the last year, and there have been several trades above $1,000 a foot. Mike LaBelle : I think also, on Marriott, the one thing that Doug pointed out that's important is we're not going to be done with our obligation in 2021, which is building the shell. So it's kind of a 2.5-year, maybe a 3-year process. But Marriott is then going to do all their TI work and get into occupancy, and we can't recognize any revenue until they're done with that. So we're kind of -- we're dependent upon them to kind of finish that and be in sometime in '22 before we can actually book any revenue. John Guinee : Well, let me ask another quick one. Morrison Foerster is a major tenant of yours. Is that the -- are they a major tenant in D.C.? And are they going to move to the OFC development site? Or is it a different city in which MoFo is an occupant? And then second, Owen, you talked about inflation being low. And I guess, for Owen or Doug, when you look at development costs, you look at operating expense, you look at labor. Does it actually feel as if inflation is as low as the national statistics indicate? Doug Linde : So MoFo is a tenant at 250 West 55th Street, so we don't have any Washington, D.C. exposure. I get together with people in Boston. We talk about what you've described with the head of the Federal Reserve in Boston every 90 days. And my conversation and comments have been that we continue to see two things going on with the inputs for new buildings. One is that labor costs are going up, and they're going up at a reasonable rate. The average union contract, I think, has got a 3% or 3.5% annualized increase. And it gets built into -- every six months, there's a portion of that that occurs. And the second is just how busy people are. And so the busier the sub-trades are, the less attractive it is for them to bid on new business, which means that they're bidding to lose effectively. And so they're pushing up their profit margins. And so those inputs are causing issues. And I think the one that's most interesting right now is, for example, the cost of concrete and the way the structures are being built in Washington, D.C. There seems to be so much going on that there's some significant pricing increases going on in that particular labor input. So we are seeing a higher rate of increase in our construction costs, and we are building those escalations effectively into all of our budgets that we're putting together. And so all of our returns that we described to you assume that, that escalation is the input when we actually come to a [GNP] and we finalize the bids on all of our subs. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors. Jed Reagan : You've talked about a pretty active near-term development pipeline I think 2.5 million square feet you guys outlined. Is there a cap? I guess a couple of questions on that. I mean is there a cap that you guys would consider for sort of the development as a percent of total assets? How are you guys thinking about financing that growth? And then would any of that leasing be coming out of existing BXP space? Owen Thomas : So Jed, to answer your question, we don't have a cap. We do obviously pay attention to how much development we have as a percent of our total enterprise. We think right now, it's around $3 billion. And we're over a $30 billion enterprise, so we think that's completely reasonable. However, I would also point out that these developments that we just added this quarter, they're 100% leased, so add very attractive development yield. So our real -- obviously, we have theoretical credit risk with the tenants, but also the delivery risk of the building in terms of costs and timing. But those are very different risks than building spec buildings or building partially-leased buildings. So again, we don't have a cap. And all of the development that I described is either fully pre-leased or very substantially pre-leased. And that continues to be a condition going forward. Mike LaBelle : And only one of the tenants we're talking to in Washington has a presence with us in one of our buildings. Owen Thomas : Yes. Doug Linde : And on the funding side, I think we made it pretty clear, when Mike made his presentation and James Magaldi made their presentations at our Investor Conference, that our net debt-to-EBITDA is going down, down, down. And we are burning off a significant amount of the development pipeline that's currently in process because those buildings are coming to fruition, and they're going to be cash flow positive. And so, effectively what we're doing is replacing the $2.5 billion to $3 billion that's currently today underway with a similar amount, with a much higher capacity to use our balance sheet to fund that. So again, if the question is, do we have a concern about funding, and are we raising equity, I think the answer is we don't have a concern, and we're not planning on raising any equity. Jed Reagan : And I guess two kind of housekeeping items on guidance for next year. I might have missed this, but are you projecting any dispositions for next year? And then in terms of your year-end 2018 occupancy, what type of growth or sort of backfilling of the 399 Park space does that project? Mike LaBelle : So the guidance doesn't include any dispositions or acquisitions at all for 2018. And as I mentioned, at 399 Park, we do not expect any of that space to be in our occupancy figures in 2018. As I mentioned, the space, really, it's 20-year-old Citibank space that needs to be demoed and rebuilt. The new tenants coming in are going to be putting in their tenant improvements, and they won't be able to get those tenant improvements complete before the end of 2018 even if we signed a lease today. So we won't be able to get any revenue or any occupancy, we believe, in 399. Jed Reagan : Even on a GAAP basis? Mike LaBelle : Because the space is demoed, we can't start revenue. The GAAP rules are that the space has to be ready for its intended use. So if you have somebody that comes in and uses the existing improvements, even if they make some of their own changes on their own -- not necessarily dime, but on their own, then you cannot recognize revenue until they're done. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : You've had some activity in Reston this quarter. Can you just comment on why you decided to sell the land to the corporate buyer rather than develop for them? Owen Thomas : Sure. So the parcel of land that Ray will describe is more of a -- I guess, what you'd refer to as a greenbelt parcel as opposed to an urban parcel in the center of Reston. And it's a site that we've owned for the better part of 15 years, and it's really not part of the Reston Town Center development per se. It's actually physically, I think, 1.5 miles to the south. And so we had a corporate user who came along and said they wanted us to build the building for them. And we said, we'd love to build the building and lease it to you. And they said, we want to own and so, ultimately, we decided to sell it. Doug Linde : And any time you can add a Fortune 50 name to the Reston tenant occupancy list, that's a plus. So it was not a strategically-important site, and it really just continues to validate Reston as the premier corporate location in the suburbs of Washington. John Kim : Who is that company? And also, can you also discuss the additional 3 million of FAR that you're looking to entitle as far as the cost and the use of that land? Raymond Ritchey : I guess we can release -- it's General Dynamics, right? I guess I just did. Owen Thomas : I think you did. Raymond Ritchey : And it's actually 3 million to 4 million square feet. It will be a rezoning of the land that's currently occupied by Reston Corporate Center. That's directly across the street from the Reston Town Center Metro stop. As part of the additional density comes forth with the introduction of Metro to Reston Town Center, it will be a mix of, again, between 3 million and 4 million square feet, half of which will be residential, half of which will be commercial. And again, we're bringing that on at a very competitive basis, given that it's land we've owned -- a building we've owned for over 20 years. Peter, do you have anything to add? Peter Johnston : No, I think that sums it up. It's just going to be a continuation of the mixed-use development we've got in the urban core town center. John Kim : At the GM Building, it's been over a year since you signed Under Armour for some of the retail space. Since then, their share price is down over 60%. Is there any risk that this lease does not go through? Doug Linde : So the lease is in full force and effect, and we expect Under Armour will occupy the building. We're not delivering the space to Under Armour probably until the very end of 2018, and then they're going to have to build it out. So my guess is their plans don't assume that they're going to be in there for quite some time. Remember, Under Armour had $1.4 billion of sales this quarter. They still expect to be over $5 billion for 2017. Even after a restructuring charge, they had positive net income. They have a net debt-to-EBITDA of just 1.5 times. This is a real strong company, and there's no question that their growth trajectory has changed over the last two quarters. But we're believers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi. Manny Korchman : Mike, maybe just to help us with modeling or thinking about growth for next year. If you were to reaggregate NOI contribution from the same-store properties as well as the development properties and other external growth, how much year-over-year just NOI growth in general on both a GAAP and cash basis do you expect next year? Doug Linde : I think that's a question he's got to -- I'm not going to let him answer until he does some math. I think that we attempted to give you an answer to that by describing the increase in our revenue from '17 to '18. The issue with doing it on an NOI basis is that the development contribution is dependent upon the buildings coming online, and the margin on those development pipelines changes over each quarter as the space is delivered. So I think Mike will have to get back to you on that one. Mike LaBelle : I mean, the size of our same-store pool is $1.460 billion approximately. That's the kind of 2017 roughly same-store contribution. So if you want to add the $40 million to $50 million of development NOI to the guidance that I provided on the same-store of 0.5% to 2.5%, I guess, that's how you would get it. Manny Korchman : Got it, that's helpful. And then, Mike, at the Investor Day, you gave a few nuggets of 2018 guidance without giving us full guidance. One of them was interest expense being up $25 million to $45 million. It looks like that increase is now smaller given the guidance last night. Is there anything specific driving that? Mike LaBelle : No. I mean, there's nothing specific. Obviously, we do re-projections every quarter. We do re-projections on what our development outflows are and how they're going to be funded versus cash, versus use of our line based upon what our projections tell us. And that we've got some refinancing that we still need to do on a couple of loans that expire in 2018. So you kind of change around what you think the interest rates might be and some of the timing might be on that as well as, again, at -- last quarter, we expected that we would be in our line in December. We now don't expect that we'll be in our line until February, and that's simply a function of the development outflow changing a little bit. So when you kind of put all those things in the model, it just brought the interest expense down a little bit. Owen Thomas : One of the most interesting things about when you do development is that we provide TI dollars to a lot of our customers. And a lot of them spend the money, and it takes them a long time to ask for it. And so the outflow that Salesforce Tower on the TI side are not insignificant, and there -- we just haven't gotten much of a draw yet. And so we're getting the advantage of not having to pay the capital out as early as we would have liked. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Santos with Sandler O'Neill. Daniel Santos : Just two questions for me. The first one is on 2018 guidance. You guys gave a midpoint of $6.28, which is below where The Street is. Just wondering if you had any insight into what the major items that The Street is missing that caused that disconnect? Mike LaBelle : We did our best to try to, at our Investor Conference and in the last couple of quarters, describe the impact that 399 Park would have on our same-store growth. If it weren't for those 200 basis points, our same-store would be up like 2.5% and 4.5%, which is really pretty strong, I think. So I feel like we tried to do everything we could in the major items. Perhaps the termination income that is down $18 million, maybe some people didn't kind of focus on that.  Although, all the termination income that we're talking about for 2017 is already in the numbers, right, and we've already got $22.5 million of the $24 million that we project. So I think that we typically and The Street typically understands that we don't estimate that we're going to have big terminations in the following year that we don't know about. I also think that the refinancing of the GM Building was very confusing because of all the impact on our non-controlling interest and our interest expense. And I'm very happy that it's now cleaned up, but until you kind of get through a full year of it or a full run rate of it, it's just kind of harder to estimate. So some of the non-controlling interest that -- I commented in here non-controlling interest in our guidance is up by $8 million, at the midpoint about $0.05. Maybe people didn't quite get that, and it really had to do with both their share of the demolition expense is not happening anymore in the GM Building refinance. So I think those are the areas. Daniel Santos : And separately, given the desire to expand in L.A. and the CBS Studios being up for sale, do you guys have any interest in that asset? Owen Thomas : We're not going to comment on specific investments that we're pursuing. As you know, we are -- our goal is to grow in L.A., and we're going to do it on a measured basis. We're actively looking at both development opportunities and acquisitions. I would say that our pipeline has probably improved over the last month since the Investor Conference. We've seen more things. I think having our new colleague, Jon Lange, on the ground in L.A. has also been very helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jamie Feldman : Mike, thanks for the detailed guidance and a very comprehensive Investor Day. Can you talk about what the guidance means for your AFFO outlook? And also, any thoughts on dividend coverage and prospects for maybe a bump next year? Mike LaBelle : So I think that our AFFO is going to be up. For 2017, we think it's going to be somewhere in the $4.20 to $4.25 range. And for 2018, I think that our range will be closer to kind of $4.35 to $4.65 range. Our same-store rents are going to be lower. I mean, our noncash rents are going to be lower. We've provided guidance of that. And I think our tenant transaction costs we've got to do about 2.8 million square feet of leasing to meet our occupancy goals. So we think that that's probably somewhere between $180 million and $210 million of leasing transaction costs. And we should have a return CapEx of somewhere around $80 million to $90 million. And then if you kind of look at what our run rate is for stock compensation and straight-line ground rent and other stuff, you get adjustments of probably somewhere in the high 200s, $275 million to $300 million. So I think we're going to be up pretty strongly at the midpoint. That's up 8% over 2017, and it's actually up 40% since 2015. So our AFFO has been very, very strong growth over the last few years, as we've burned off a lot of free rent and things like that. What was the other question, Jamie? Jamie Feldman : Just whether you'll start pushing up against the need to bump the dividend? Mike LaBelle : Yes. So I mean, we've talked before about where we are and where we expect to be in 2017 from a taxable income perspective and our dividend, which is I think fairly close in line. We haven't made any decisions on our dividend for the fourth quarter of 2017. We're going to be meeting with our board in the fourth quarter to talk more about it. I mean, I can say that we believe our cash NOI is going to grow significantly over the next few years. And if we don't sell a lot of assets, which are not currently in our business plan, our expectation over the next few years is we would have dividend growth in line with what that growth is. But we haven't made any decisions yet about this year. Jamie Feldman : And then I know at your Investor Day, you guys spent a lot of time talking about WeWork and coworking. Since that time, we've seen WeWork go direct into owning assets, buying assets. I'm just curious, is that something you guys expected to happen? And what are your general thoughts as a landlord as they do seem to be looking to own more assets going forward? Owen Thomas : Our posture hasn't changed on coworking or on WeWork. As I think we have all described in different ways, we have felt that coworking and, therefore WeWork, has been a positive factor for the office business this cycle. I think we gave some data at the Investor Conference that coworking represented around 20% of the net absorption in the country. And again, that's a big positive. With respect to WeWork investing in real estate, one thing that is -- certainly, if you study it, people are aware of, they're not doing it all themselves. They have a partnership with an outside fund manager. And I don't know the specifics of what the percentage interests are in all these properties, but WeWork is not buying all these buildings 100% onto their balance sheet. They're doing it, I assume, partially, but not fully. And they, again, have a partner with which -- with whom they're doing it. And we certainly haven't run into a situation where we have -- are competing with them for investing in a particular building. Jamie Feldman : Any other color from anyone else? Owen Thomas : No, I think that's it. Jamie Feldman : And then just last for me. Ray, General Dynamics, the tenant you mentioned, would you say you're starting to see a meaningful turn here in defense contractors and leasing demand from defense in your region? Raymond Ritchey : Well, clearly, we've been through a two-year or three-year cycle, where they've really been focused on cutting costs and perhaps uncertainty in the defense budget, and now we're seeing more clarity. We see more contracts being funded. We still see those defense users looking to be efficient in their space use and consolidate. And we see them going to locations like Reston Town Center, where they can recruit, retain and motivate the best and brightest. So it's always been a situation in Northern Virginia where the demand for space can rise and fall on the defense budget. But for now, right now, we're getting very good direction from these users that they'll continue to be taking down space and it's obviously very helpful for our specific market in Reston. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nick Stelzner with Morgan Stanley. Nick Stelzner : So if I heard you correctly, you said that the rent roll-down at 767 was about 50% on a net basis. But overall, New York City was only down about 4%. I guess can you give a little color on the mark-to-market leasing for the rest of the New York portfolio? And I guess, was 767 the only space with a rent roll-down this quarter? Doug Linde : From a weighting perspective, it bore way more than its fair share of the roll-down. As I said, we had about 190,000 square feet of space rolling over. And most of the space in New York City was rolling up. We had a couple of small pieces of space that rolled down. But if you were to pull that one out, we would have had a significant roll-up in New York City. Nicholas Stelzner : And then I may have missed this earlier on, but could you give us an update on the leasing activity at 159 East 53rd? Doug Linde : John Powers, do you want to take that one? John Powers : Yes. I think we have two good prospects at 159. Both would take more than half the building. We hope we make one of those deals. And we have a number of smaller prospects, so I think it's going well. The curtain wall is almost done now, and it's showing much better than it did. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rob Simone with Evercore ISI. Rob Simone, your line is open. Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Blaine Heck : Doug, you guys don't have a lot of expirations in 2018, but some of them, especially in New York, have pretty high rental rates. So I'm guessing we're going to see some moderation in spreads this coming year. Is that the right way to think about it? And maybe, Mike, can you comment on any rent spread assumptions you guys have built into guidance? Doug Linde : So there's very little rollover on a going-forward basis in New York City at this point. And so as we lease up space, what hits our statistics are, for the most part, the leases that are within one year. And so, for example, were we to lease the space at 399 that is currently available, you would see basically a flat number. The rents that rolled off were in between the high 80s and low 100s. And we expect the base of the building will be leased in the high 80s, and we expect the space in the tower will be leased in between $105 and $120 a square foot. So as I think I've said this for a couple of quarters, we're basically running to be in place at that building. If we were to lease the 33rd or 34th floor of the General Motors Building, there would be a very big roll-up because those rents were very low when we took the space back from Weil Gotshal. And those are the two major parts of the vacancy, where there was a second generation that occur in 2018. Blaine Heck : And then, Mike, anything assumed specifically in guidance? Mike LaBelle : For the 2018 rollovers? Blaine Heck : Yes, for rent spreads? Mike LaBelle : I think that as Doug said, the rent spreads are pretty flat. The one deal that we do have going on is we've got 60,000 square feet rolling at 601, where we've got an active tenant on one of those floors, that's two floors, in one of those floors. So that hopefully will happen with no downtime. The other floor we're going to assume is going to be down for a period of time. So I think for the most part, that rollover, we're expecting that it would have a negative impact on our 2018 guidance because we would have some downtime with all of that piece. Doug Linde : But mark-to-market will be up. Mike LaBelle : Yes. Doug Linde : We're going to roll space that's leased at $105 a square foot and, hopefully, we'll get $120 or $125 a square foot. That's the sort of the nature of the difference in the rents. Blaine Heck : And then Doug, you touched on this, but at 399 Park, you guys consolidated the space on seven, eight, nine and maybe even 10, if I'm remembering right, from the Investor Day. I think it totals around 250,000 square feet. Can you talk about whether that consolidation resulted in kind of a noticeable pickup in interest? And any more color on the types of tenants you're talking to and what stage of negotiations you are in at this point? Doug Linde : I'll make one short comment, and I'll let John -- John, if you want. So big picture, what we did is we substituted a 102,000-square foot really big base floor on three with 2 60,000-square foot floors on eight and nine. So we immediately improved our sub-divisibility. John, you can talk about the block. John Powers : Well, that eight and nine goes with seven, and we're also getting 10 back from Eton Park next year. So that's the block. And you're right, it's about 250,000 feet. And we have very good activity on the block. And that's much more leasable. It's further up in the building. It's more light and air. It's a little higher priced, but block of 250,000 feet with 60,000-foot center core, that's unique on Park Avenue. So we have good activity on it. Blaine Heck : Owen, your commentary points to an investment sales market in New York that's, I guess, still somewhat active, but we've seen transactions come down substantially year-over-year, and there's been concern about the appetite from foreign capital sources. Can you just give us your view on how you expect pricing to trend in the next 12 months? Have we hit a bottom for cap rates? And do you think we'll see any meaningful expansion over the next year? Owen Thomas : Well, as I said, transaction volume's down overall in the country. The number's around 27%, and it's true in New York as well. I do think more of the assets have traded to long-term institutional holders now, particularly the larger trophy assets like REITs and other institutional holders. And they're less frequent sellers versus investors that are more opportunistic and have a shorter-term time frame. And so by definition, I think you see less assets in the market, and I also think the investment community is becoming more exacting about risk. So is this building -- just being in New York's not good enough. Where is it in New York? What's the location? Public transportation? Neighborhood? And then the leasing status. The leasing risk is less of interest, and I think return requirements for those kinds of risk have gone up. In terms of -- but that being said, I think there's a continual rotation of investors that are in and out of the market. I think that New York and our other gateway markets continue to be of interest to investors from Canada, the Middle East, Europe, China, Japan, Singapore, other places in Asia. I don't think that's changed. I think there is a little bit of cycling. Right now, perhaps the Chinese investors are a little bit less active. The Japanese investors are getting a little bit more active. In terms of forecasting for next year, it's difficult. I do think it's going to be very related to interest rates. And as I mentioned, even though we see some things that might lead you to think interest rates will be higher, like the Fed increasing the short end of the curve and the gradual reduction of QE, I do think we're going to continue to operate in a relatively-low interest rate environment. And therefore, the yields from real estate will be attractive. And I think New York and our other gateway markets will continue to be of keen interest to institutional investors from around the world. Mike LaBelle : I think the scarcity of the products as well. Owen Thomas : I think what Mike's just saying with less buildings on the market that also creates more scarcity when one does come on the market. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc. Craig Mailman : Mike, on the $850 million maturing at the -- near the end of '18, just can you kind of give updated thoughts on how far out in the curve you guys are thinking to go there and what pricing expectations are in the guidance? Mike LaBelle : So our guidance expectations are that we refinance it within 90 days of its maturity. There's an open window, and that we refinance it with a comparable term. So if you kind of look at our expiration ladder, 2028 is open for a 10-year deal. We can do a 10-year deal today at about 3.5%. Also open is 2025. So we could do a 7-year deal, and a 7-year deal is closer to 3.25% today. So I think that's what we probably would think about from a maturity perspective. I don't think we would go out and do a 30-year or something like that. And with respect to timing, we'll see. We're always kind of monitoring the market and looking at where we think interest rates are going, where we think the bond market is going. And the bond market has been very [pitiful] in 2017. I have no reason to believe why it won't continue to be so, but we're consistently looking at those markets. Craig Mailman : And we shouldn't expect -- you have a higher coupon piece maturing in October of '19. The make-whole would probably be too onerous to bring that in during '18. Is that kind of a fair way to look at it? Mike LaBelle : It's fair to say that the prepayment penalty associated with the 19 and the 20s is pretty high, and which makes it a little bit less attractive to try to do something like that. We do these calculations all the time and thinking about it all the time, and we'll continue to do so, but it's certainly not in any guidance that we have. Operator : We have time for one final question, and that question comes from Rob Simone with Evercore ISI. Robert Simone : I was on mute. Just a quick question on the incremental debt. Mike, I think you mentioned that it was about $550 million on the term facility and the credit line. Is that -- the funding requirement there, is that solely from the existing development pipeline? Or does that contemplate any future developments? And I have one quick follow-up on interest expense. Mike LaBelle : That's only assuming the existing pipeline that we've shown everybody. So it does not assume that we're successful in signing additional leases at some of the other properties that both Owen and Doug talked about, which would increase our pipeline. And some of those properties would start to fund in 2018, so that would increase the requirement to fund those and also increase our capitalized interest, however. Again, normally, funding development projects doesn't necessarily increase your interest expense because you've got a capitalized interest offset. But in this case, we're delivering a lot of stuff in '17 and '18, which causes us not to kind of get the benefit of that, which is why almost all of the funding that we have projected so far for '18 kind of just drops into the interest expense bucket as an increase in interest expense. Robert Simone : And then one final last question. Mike, you mentioned that the Colorado Center financing was going to increase your share of interest expense from unconsolidated by about $5 million. The range that you guys provide for guidance, is that only on a consolidated basis? Or is that inclusive of your share of all interest expense, just for clarity? Mike LaBelle : The range we provide is only on a consolidated basis. So it's kind of unusual that we have a big change on the unconsolidated JVs, and it's typically pretty small because that portfolio's pretty small. But this quarter, obviously, I wanted to point it out because it does affect '18. We -- on the NOI for the unconsolidated properties, we include that in our same-store guidance, our share. So the only thing we kind of don't pick up is any changes in interest expense that might affect year-to-year. And as I said, typically, it doesn't have much of an impact. This year, it does, which is why I wanted to point it out on the call and to put it in our press release. Owen Thomas : That completes our call. Thank you for your questions. Thank you for your interest in Boston Properties, and we look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT in Dallas in a couple of weeks. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's Boston Properties conference call. Thank you again for attending, and have a good day.",

Also during the question-and-answer portion of our call, our regional management team will be available to answer questions as well. I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks. Owen Thomas : Thank you, Arista. Good morning, everyone. We have been very active over the last few months winning important new business and in the process delivered another strong quarter which I would summarize as follows. Delivered FFO per share $0.04 above street consensus and $0.04 above our prior forecast excluding the impact of the financing we did last quarter due to operational improvements, increase in midpoint of our full-year 2018 guidance by $0.07 after an adjustment for recent property sale. Increased our quarterly dividend by $0.05 or 7%, leased 2.4 million square feet which is significantly above our long-term quarterly average for the period, increased office portfolio occupancy by 50 basis points to 90.7%, completed an $850 million unsecured refinancing on very favorable terms, signed enhancement lease commitment and development of 20 CityPoint. Commenced development of the Hub on Causeway residential project, signed an anchor lease commitment for 66% of the office space in our 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue development. And in January, signed a lease with Leidos to develop our new headquarters at 1750 President, the last remaining site in the core of Reston Town Center. Clearly we have been having a busy and productive period. Let me first move to the macro environment. The prospects for global and U.S. growth are healthy and stable. The global economy outperformed consensus forecast last year with growth projected to be just over 3% in 2018. Though U.S. economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter of 2017 to 2.6% growth is projected to remain at a comparable level for 2018. And we believe recent federal Tax Reform will likely provide a boost and prolong our economic recovery. Job creation also remains steady and favorable with nearly 150,000 jobs created in December and unemployment is at 4.1% at lowest level since well before the global financial crisis. On financial markets, fears of inflation and resultant higher interest rates permeate the press and consensus thinking. Facts are, the 10 year U.S. treasury has risen only around 30 basis points this year and inflation remains fairly steady and muted at 2.1%. Though we believe, the fed is committed to further rate hikes in 2018, Interest rates continue to be low globally and we remain skeptical of a significant upward move in long-term rates in the U.S. in the near and medium-term. We think the impacts to Boston Properties of recent federal Tax Reform is clearly favorable certainly for the foreseeable future. Many of the features of the U.S. tax codes that are important to us and the real estate industry such as REIT status, like kind exchanges, deductibility of interest, depreciation of structure and they remain intact. Further our customer base, generally taxpaying entities will have increased earnings which should spur investments and leasing activity. The office markets and sub markets where we operate remain in general equilibrium. However, new deliveries of office space outpaced net absorption in 2017. Doug will provide m ore specific leasing color, but the statistics for our size major markets, our net absorption for 2017 was 2.4 million square feet or about 0.4% of occupied space while deliveries were 4.8 million feet or 0.7% of stock. Vacancy increased modestly 40 basis points to 8.4% while rents grew 3.3%. Leasing activity remains healthy with broad-based activity in both the technology and traditional industry segments. In the private real estate equity market, office transaction volume ended 2017 down 25% from 2016 levels, primarily due to less product available in the market. Though cap rates remains reasonably stable for leased assets in our core markets, many domestic and international investors have significant capital targeting commercial real estate and we foresee healthy transaction volumes and steady pricing in 2018. There once again were numerous significant asset transactions in our markets this past quarter, a few are in Washington DC 1440 New York Avenue sold for nearly $1,200 a square foot and a mid-4s cap rate to an European institution, this is a 2,000 foot building that\u2019s fully leased. Also in Washington a smaller 114,000 square foot building 900 G Street sold for over $1,300 a foot, a low-4s cap rate to a European high net worth buyer. This deal represents a new record price per square foot for the Washington DC market. In downtown Santa Monica 520 Broadway which is again a little over 100,000 feet sold and it\u2019s 50% leased to rework and 84% leased overall, so for 1,036 a square foot and a 3.9% cap rate, the stabilized cap rate upon lease up will be over 5%. And El Segundo, Campus 2100 sold for $574 per square foot in the high-4s cap rate to a domestic pension advisor. And lastly, in New York the sale of a minority interest in 1515 Broadway is under agreement at a valuation of over $1,000 a foot and a low-4s cap rate. This is a 1.8 million square foot building. It\u2019s fully leased and it\u2019s being recapped with a European institution. Now I will move to our capital activities. Last year, we sold 31 million in non-core assets and just completed the sale of 500 E Street in Washington DC for 128 million or around 6% cap rate when incorporating capital required for existing tenant obligation assumed by the purchaser. In 2018 we will continue to prune non-core assets and as a result upgrade our portfolio and expect to sell approximately 200 million to 300 million of property including the 500 E Street sale. We do not anticipate a particularly active year in acquisitions, though we are always in the market reviewing deals, we would prefer to develop to 6% to 7% yield then purchase assets at a yield which is generally 200 basis points lower. Assets that require repositioning to meet our criteria and we continue to have ambition to carefully grow our footprint in LA. Development will remain our key strategy to create value for shareholders and our development activity remains very active with many new pre-leased projects either committed or under pursuit. As mentioned, this quarter, we added 20 CityPoint to the active pipeline. It\u2019s 211,000 square foot mirror building with 10 CityPoint in Waltham which we completed in 2015. The property is 52% pre-leased and the anchor tenant is projected to occupy in the third quarter of 2019. We added the next phase of our mixed use Hub on Causeway development in Boston which is a 440 unit high rise residential building. We owned this in a joint venture with the Delaware North Company and our share of the project cost is $154 million. The project will deliver its first units in late 2019. With these additions, our current development pipeline stands at 12 office and residential development and redevelopments comprising 6.2 million - 3.4 billion of development. Most of the pipeline is well underway and we have 1.5 billion remaining to fund. The commercial component of this portfolio 81% pre-leased up from 75% last quarter and aggregate projected cash yields are approximately 7% in total. Further, we have committed to but have not yet commenced in our active pipeline 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington DC and 1750 presidents for Leidos in Reston together representing 744,000 square feet and $520 million in investment. These projects are collectively 76% prerelease. And lastly we have four different tenant negotiations underway in Cambridge, Boston, Washington DC and Reston to anchor four significant and largely pre-leased new office developments representing 2.5 million square feet of additional start in 2018 and 2019. The pace of our new development activity has clearly accelerated over the past few quarters. This is solely due to our success in winning mandates with important customers, not due to our willingness to accept lower yields and higher levels of risk. All other projects we have recently launched and hope to start in the next few quarters our substantially pre-leased. New development such as the Salesforce Tower will come into service over the next few quarters and dramatically increase our operating cash flow. As a result will be able to fund our new development pipeline using debt without materially increasing our leverage profile. If however, we elect to seek equity to fund the portion of the pipelines it will be raised through the sale and/or joint venture of select assets or development not through issuing equity at our current share price. So to conclude, we are increasingly confident about achieving our clearly communicated plan to materially increase our NOI starting in 2019 through development deliveries and leasing up our existing assets. And growth beyond 2020 is now becoming more clear and likely given all the developments we have added and expect to add to our pipeline. I will turn it over to Doug. Doug Linde : Thanks Owen, good morning everybody, happy new year. I want to pick up on Owen\u2019s economic commentary as it relates to office demand in our markets. As evidenced by their actions our primary customers which are larger real estate users, the public, the private, the start up and the established are exhibiting renewed confidence by making the decision to either upgrade and consolidate their space and in some cases expand. As Owen suggested, as we begin 2018 we are as busy as we have ever been with new development investments on a pre-leased office portfolio. We also have three residential projects, Owen described the most recent and two of those are opening this year. In fact one of them is opened as we speak and we are taking leasing in Reston. 20 CityPoint was leased to an engineering firm 1750 in Reston Town Center is leased to Leidos a science engineering and technology government contractor, also called the defense contractor. They are currently in 170,000 square feet and two of our other buildings in Reston Town Center and is part of the consolidation they are taking 100% to 175,000 square feet of this new building. While we continue to see the bulk of new incremental office demand from technology and life science businesses, here is also robust demand for new space but not necessarily growth from traditional industries. For example, if you look at the leasing activity in Manhattan in 2017 the finance, insurance and the real estate sectors led the way. I think there are some articles recently about two banks that look like they were expanding and/or consolidating in Midtown and there are a number of recent law firms announcements that will be coming to take new space in Midtown Manhattan. One of the topics that we are being queried about recently, our expectations for market growth, rental growth in our markets. So the first thing you have to consider is that we have seen significant market rental growth over the last few years from the lease up and delivery of all of the new construction in our market. New construction rents are higher in most cases than current rent. This is true in New York City, in Boston, in San Francisco and Washington DC. Now the impact on existing inventory which makes up the bulk of the availability in all the markets is not quite as simple to delineate. But in general we would say that overall taking rent for existing space in 2018 are probably going to be pretty flat versus 2017. Now this excludes some of the exceptional sub markets like Cambridge or the leasing at newer buildings south of market in San Francisco. This will also come with rising tenant improvement contributions. Now you have heard me say this before and it bears repeating, higher concessions of the product have two factors; one is increased supply; and the second is dramatically higher construction cost when building out tenant improvement. We increased our TI contribution as we completed the last round of deals at Salesforce Tower along with significantly increasing our rental rates and our annual escalations. On the other hand, we have also had to increase our contribution in New York City as supply has become more of a factor. Now as you know the increasing market rent is a much less important determination of our revenue growth than the mark-to-market of our inspiring leases and changes in occupancy. This quarter the mark-to-market on our leases that have an economic impact was pretty flat overall, but varied widely by market. In Boston, we were up about 6%, so 98% of the portfolio that hit the numbers this quarter was in our suburban assets. In New York City, we were actually down just under 4%, but this was because of the big ticket relax that we had done at 399 Park Avenue and they are pretty close to the forecast that we have talked about over the last few years. The base of that building is going to be pretty flat, the high rise in the building is going to be up. In DC we were down 6% due to a 22,000 square foot lease in our last suburban Montgomery County asset where rents have rolled out significantly. And in San Francisco we were up 62% on a small portfolio of about 50,000 square feet which was concentrated in our Mountain View single-storey product. I\u2019m going to start my regional comment with Salesforce Tower in San Francisco and I suspect this is the last call where we\u2019ll have much to say about leasing activity there. During the quarter, we leased an additional 205,000 square feet including leases with a law firm, a private equity firm, an investment manager, and a co-working company. As of today, we are 97% leased and the first tenants have moved into the building. Every lease we have signed, we are negotiating, and is scheduled to commence by the third quarter of 2019. The only new construction with remaining availability in the city of San Francisco today is Park Tower 750,000 square foot building which will likely be available in late 2018. The next building to be delivered first in mission is probably 2022 or beyond. Large blocks of contiguous available space are going to be come in the form of sub-lets from tenants that are moving to the new construction or business failure. This quarter, our 56,000 square foot tenant at 50 Hawthorne exited the market and they entered to an as is sub-let for their entire space with a nine year term remaining at a mid-80s starting rent. They were paying $64 gross with share in the Subway product. As we move into 2018 our bay area activity is going to be centered around the 80,000 square foot block we are getting back from the one tenant the only tenant that is relocating from Embarcadero Center to Salesforce Tower and four available floors at EC4 though they are not contiguous. Along with a whole host of early renewals that are underway. In the fourth quarter, we completed about 100,000 square feet of office leasing at Embarcadero Center. As of Monday we have three offers on the block that we are getting back from 80,000 square feet and EC1, three offers on 80,000 square foot block. There will also be some rollover in Mountain View where we continue to be delighted by the strength of that market. The bulk of our portfolio increase in our 2018 estimates outlined in the press release is a direct result of the strong leasing occupancy gains from the Boston region. In Boston we completed another 66,000 square feet of leasing at 200 Clarendon during the quarter bringing our total leasing to 350,000 square feet in 2017, and we currently have another 25,000 square feet that were done this quarter and we are negotiating a deal for our last currently vacant floor 30,000 square feet. We completed our lease negotiations at the Hub on Causeway for 147,000 square feet of the 180,000 square feet of podium office space that build as Owen said is going to be opening in the third quarter of 2019. And we have reached agreement with the retail users for 36,000 square feet which will get us 95% of the retail space committed and 89% of that total project. Demand for space in Boston from growing technology tenant is as strong as we have ever seen it. Hence our discussions with another tenant possibly for the Tower at the Hub on Causeway. A year ago, I described the possible opportunity to recapture the Microsoft lease at 455 Main Street in Cambridge. This has in fact happened, we took it back on the 31st of December, we have signed a lease we have re-let 90,000 square feet of the 105,000 square feet block the roll up on the 90,000 square feet is the 122% on a net basis that will hit our statistics next quarter. In our Waltham, Lexington suburban portfolio we completed 395,000 square feet this quarter including another 71,000 at our 191 Spring Street redevelopment that\u2019s now 88% leased and saw its first occupancy earlier this month. Last quarter we foreshadowed starting a new building and when said we hit the goal of 20 CityPoint. And we have active interest for the remainder of that building. As we said at our investor conference the most significant opportunity for high contribution occupancy improvement is in our New York City portfolio. At 399 Park we are in active discussions with a tenant that could take the entire low-rise block 250,000 square feet and we have an active pipeline of tenants of between 65,000 square feet to 150,000 square feet for the low-rise space if that field doesn't happen and a number of tenants for a high-rise floors. In fact we have in excess of 700,000 square feet of proposals outstanding at that building. At 159 East 53rd Street discussions or even further along with a tenant that will take the entire 195,000 square foot block. Tier 2, activity is significantly higher than it was at the end of the third quarter and we have multiple proposals outstanding. These deals are in line with our original rental assumption of mid to high 80s starting rents in the low rise but our tenant improvement contribution will be higher than what our expectations were two years ago. At the top of 399, we have a full floor lease under negotiation where rents are in the $120 a square foot area. Given the condition of the space and the build out requirements future executed leases for these building will not run through our 2018 numbers, but they will be part of 2019. We completed a lot of leasing during the fourth quarter in New York City, 622,000 square feet and it was centered around long-term renewals. I previously mentioned in the previous quarter the early lease extensions that we were working on with Ann Taylor at Time Square Tower for their 2020 expirations. While we have also completed a 70,000 square foot law firm renewal at Time Square Tower, a 90,000 square foot law firm expansion at 601 Lexington Avenue and on 767 Fifth General Motors building, one of our anchor tenants has exercised an expansion rate and will be adding the 77,000 square foot of swing space that we recaptured last year. If you remember that termination income we discussed, as part of these premises, when it renews and extends in 2022 and we have another anchor tenant that expanded by 39,000 square feet. Big quarter in New York on the renewal and extension perspective. Finally, our view on the high end in New York which is defined as over a $100 a square foot, in 2017 is as follows. There were a lot of deals done over $100 a square foot. The most since 2008 based on total square footage. Seven of the top 10 were new construction which tells you tenants will pay a premium for new product and on the other hand there is more competition for existing high end space. As we look into 2018 the new buildings on the west side with space price over $100 are significantly leased. And the next step is not going to come online until 2021 and beyond. We expect that deals completed during 2018 at over $100 a square foot are going to drift back to the existing product or the new product on the east side which has a much higher price point. Finally, DC. Last quarter, I broke our DC activities into three themes. The pattern holds true for the fourth quarter. First, matching space and tenants together to launch new development. Last quarter with Marriott and TSA, this quarter it\u2019s 2100, Penn and 1750 in Reston. The second theme is the strength of Reston Town Center as a magnet for private sector contractors and technology tenants. This quarter we completed seven transactions for 205,000 square feet of office leasing and are working on more than 300,000 square feet of additional deals at our existing Town Center properties predominantly future of lease expirations. And finally, the CBD Class A market remains highly competitive with more availability coming online. The good news is that we don\u2019t have a lot of space. The challenge is that there are lots and lots of options for smaller tenants. I will stop there and let Mike to continue on. Michael LaBelle : Thank you, Doug. Good morning. I\u2019m going to start by describing our activity in the bond market last quarter. We actively monitor the market and we saw window late in the quarter where the bond market was feeling very strong combined with a relatively stable rate environment. This was an opportunity for us to take some financing risk off the table, lock in future interest savings and refinance our 2018 debt maturities. So in December we elected to redeem $850 million of unsecured bonds that carried a 3.85% all-in interest rate and they were scheduled to mature in November of 2018. We funded the redemption with a new seven year deal, also $850 million with an all-in yield 3.35%. We recorded a charge on the early redemption of $13.9 million or $0.08 per share that was not included in our prior earnings guidance. We also locked in approximately 50 basis points of interest savings or about $0.03 per share through 2018. Given the recent sell off in treasury it looks like a good decision today, but we will have to wait until late 2018 to know for sure. Turning to our earnings, our fourth quarter funds from operations came in at $1.49 per share excluding the impact of our debt redemption. Our FFO exceeded our guidance from last quarter by about $7 million or $0.04 per share. The majority of the increase came from higher than projected NOI from the portfolio that beat our budget by about $5 million. Largest contributors were expansion by existing tenants in New York City and in Boston that occurred earlier than anticipated. And about half the improvement was due to operating expenses coming in lower than our budget. Lastly we recorded approximately $2 million of higher than projected fee income across the portfolio. Overall 2017 was a solid year for us. We increased our dividend 7%, we grew our FFO per share by over 3%, and we grew our share of same property NOI by 2.6% despite dealing with a significant amount of lease roll over New York City. We also delivered developments that added approximately $17 million of incremental NOI and we are positioned to add substantially more going forward. And we completed $6 billion of debt transactions extending our maturities and reducing our overall borrowing cost by over 50 basis points. Looking at 2018 the major changes to our earnings projections come from asset sales, interest expense, and portfolio leasing assumptions. As Owen mentioned we sold 500 East Street in Washington DC during the first week of January. 500 East Street was built in the 1980s and it was one of the first buildings we developed in Washington. We had recently extended anchor GSA lease with a long-term flat extension for the property had minimal NOI growth going forward. The sale is not included in our prior projections and reduces our projected 2018 FFO by approximately $0.05 per share. In the portfolio as Doug described we have strong activity on some of our Bacon space particularly in Boston, New York City and San Francisco. In Boston we have now leased Bay Colony to over 90%. We project 200 Clarendon Street to reach 98% leased this year and we just signed a 90,000 square feet lease Doug mentioned to backfill the state vacated by Microsoft in Cambridge at a big roll up and rent. In New York City we project 250 West 55th Street to reach near a 100% occupancy this year in fact selling all of the states we got to back from Al Jazeera\u2019s termination. As Doug mentioned we have good leasing activity at 399 Park Avenue, but we don't expect any meaningful impact to our 2018 earnings due to the timing of occupancy. And in San Francisco we are seeing a steady stream of activity and expect to continue to gain occupancy as we fill the small vacancies complete renewals and work on back filling of the banes base that comes back to us in early 2018. Overall we are keeping our guidance for 2018 same property NOI growth steady. It\u2019s a little ironic that the improvement in our fourth quarter 2017 run rate mutes the impact of the improvement in our 2018 leasing assumptions. We still assume growth in our share of same property NOI for 2018 over 2017 to be within a range of 0.5% to 2.5%, but from a higher starting point. However, we are increasing our guidance for straight-line rents by $5 million at the midpoint to a range of $55 million to $75 million and we project our occupancy will improve throughout 2018, approaching 92% by year-end of the. Our guidance for the incremental contribution to 2018 NOI from our development is unchanged at $40 million to $50 million. We plan to deliver two residential projects in the first half of 2018, one in Cambridge and one in Reston, but their NOI contribution for the year is projected to be nominal during the lease up period and is expected to pick up in 2019. The The two largest contributors to 2018 NOI are 888 Boylston Street which is now 93% leased, and Salesforce Tower which just commenced occupancy at the end of 2017. Salesforce Tower now 97% leased is projected to generate less than 20% of its full run rate in 2018. We project it to generate its full contribution upon stabilization in the third quarter of 2019. Our net interest expense assumptions have changed as a result of our refinancing activity and the increase in development with the addition of 20 CityPoint, the Hub on Causeway Residential and 1750 President Street to the pipeline. We project net interest expense for 2018 to be between $350 million and $380 million which is about $7 million less than our prior expectation. After accounting for the reduction in earnings from asset sales we are increasing our guidance at the midpoint by $0.07 per share for FFO. The changes from our prior guidance includes the loss of $0.05 per share from asset sales, improvement in the NOI contribution from the portfolio of $0.03 per share and lower interest expense of $0.04 per share. Our guidance range for 2018 FFO is $6.23 to $6.36 per share. As both Doug and Owen described, the most significant growth driver for us going forward is from delivering our existing developments and adding new developments to the pipeline. This quarter we succeeded in both of these areas by increasing the pipeline to 81% pre-leased for commercial space adding two new projects to the pipeline and advancing several of our other opportunities through the predevelopment phase. These activities build on the already strong growth we project over the next few years. That completes our formal remarks. Operator, if you could open up the line for questions that would be great. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi. Michael Bilerman : It\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Manny. Owen in your opening remarks you talked about the increase in development that you are seeing driven a lot by the tenants and build-to-suit opportunities that you are not aggressively going out and seeking additional risk. And I\u2019m just curious if you flip the coin over and you think the amount of tenants that are seeking new space either in existing development that have come out of the ground or in these built-to-suit opportunities, how does that position the existing stock of office buildings in you core markets that may need substantial CapEx to keep them relevant for tenants? I know you have certainly spent a lot of capital last couple of years in your buildings, but how do you sort of think about the trajectory going forward of that existing stock and are you more likely to try to buy some of these buildings and put the CapEx in and use your skill set or are you more likely to look at your portfolio and sell into it and sell off that capital need? Owen Thomas : Well I think Michael that if you go through the development activity that we are doing, it\u2019s a combination of factors that our customers are seeking new space. I mean obviously some of it is relocation, some of its consolidation from multiple locations and some of it is actual growth. So it\u2019s not all zero sum. So it\u2019s baked out at the offset. And then second as it relates to our existing portfolio, we clearly spend a lot of time assessing each of our buildings and keeping a close watch on those buildings that we think are the most competitive and the least competitive. And as we went through on our investor conference last year, we selected quite a few of our existing assets and we have embarked upon pretty significant refreshment projects, not sure I will go through all those on this call right now, but whether be it 53rd in the Lex, what we have done in the suburbs of Boston, there have been a number of assets that we think are long-term viable and interesting to customers. I mean Doug talked about the work we are doing at 53rd in Lex and the leasing activity that we are seeing at 399 and 159 is very, very active. So yes we are making those investments on assets that we think are long-term competitive, we are seeing good results from that. And then lastly we have been selectively taking assets that we don't think are going to be as competitive for the long-term and we have been pruning them. This has been a smaller activity over the last few years, but I think we fairly consistently sold between $100 million and $300 million of assets over the last two or three years. Doug Linde : So Michael, if you look at the four markets that we are in, in the significant way and we hopefully will be significantly in Los Angeles at some point in the near future. The Boston market has primarily driven by tenants coming into the market from outside of the market so there has been very \u201clittle\u201d sort of musical chair that\u2019s going on which has just driven the majority of the new construction, a lot of it is from the suburb. I mean San Francisco as you are aware, the vast majority of the new construction has been taken up by growing technology tenants and so again there has been very little inventory that\u2019s been leftover. In Washington DC there is a problem, Owen and I have referred to it as the muffin top issue which is there are a lot of people who are building new buildings and they are leasing the tops of these building for law firms and they are struggling and struggle with the rest of their phase and then that is a much more of musical chairs market. And then you are well aware some of your conversations with other public REITs about the issues associated with the supply in Manhattan and the issues that those buildings that are not recapitalizing themselves are going to have a real issues and there is going to be a significant demarcation in the availability of space in those buildings versus new constructions and building that have made the leaper phase and put new capital in. 1271 is a best example of a really tired building that said they get the bullet and they put $300 million of new capital in literally redoing the [indiscernible] systems in addition to lobby and they are being very successful leasing space. So I think you are seeing what is actually going on in real time in these various markets. Michael Bilerman : Manny had a question too. Manny Korchman : Hey guys. Doug if you could help clarify on Leidos just to understand correctly, how much space are they coming out of in your existing assets and when is that going to happen? Doug Linde : So they are coming out of 170,000 square feet, they are in two separate buildings. One of the problems just in their own prediction in Reston is that they were not all consolidated in one building and then they also did a major acquisition. And so they are going into 275,000 square feet and it will happen in probably the second quarter of 2020. Manny Korchman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors. Jed Reagan : Hey guys congratulations on a busy leasing quarter. You talked about the renewed confidence from tenants and obviously reported a lot of activity past quarter. I mean would you describe there it as being a really a noticeable shift in tenant activity just in this last quarter from Tax Reform changes and other maybe sort of optimism from other areas? And then based on what you are seeing on the ground do you believe that net absorption of rent growth could accelerate in your markets in the next year or two? Owen Thomas : I think Jim, maybe I will take the first part and Doug can take the second part. I think it\u2019s a combination of factors, I don\u2019t think a switch got slipped when Tax Reform came out and all of a sudden you know the leasing activity went up. But I do think it\u2019s a positive boost, companies that pay taxes being more profitable and therefore more willing to invest. I think that is clearly a plus. I think the one thing that also is shifting is the breadth of the leasing activity. We have talked for quarter-after-quarter about the importance of technology and life sciences and that clearly still is growing and is important, but we are also announcing growth and net absorption activity from financials, even law firms are moving-in in some cases taking more space. I think the breadth of the demand has also been very helpful. Doug Linde : And regarding where we think rental rates are going to go, again the challenge in these markets is that it\u2019s a supply problem not a demand problem. And so, to the extent that there is continued supply, I think you are going to see pressure on the economics of the existing inventory. I don\u2019t think you are going to see pressure on the economics of the new supply. And what is going on is that there is a big premium associated with the new supply relative to where tenants are moving out. And the confidence is what I think is driving them to be in a position where they are prepared to make those decisions. So the best example in our portfolio most recently has been that this firm that they took the space at 20 CityPoint. I mean that\u2019s firm an engineering company that was located in the market. They were in a tertiary building, a not traditional high quality office building. And based upon their business and quite frankly overall employment trends in these marketplaces and the desire and the needs to recruit and retain power, they said it\u2019s time for us to step it up and go into a different kind of a facility. And so they are paying significantly different kind of a rent than they were paying in their previous premises. And I think that story is going on, and on, and on in all of this new construction that\u2019s occurring across our markets predominantly with these traditionally tenants. We are not necessarily looking at this as simply a growth opportunity, but really a change in the way they are managing their businesses from a real estate facilities perspective. Jed Reagan : So you don\u2019t see the growth and concession that you referred to, you don\u2019t see that abating anytime soon either? Doug Linde : I don\u2019t, I think that as part of the new construction and the higher rent, the market has been conditioned to a higher concession level and I think that\u2019s across the board, across the country. I mean even on the last couple of spaces we have a Salesforce Tower, I mean I think we literally have 30,000 square feet, we are still prepared to give a $100 a square foot on a 10 to 15 year deal. But the rent has gone up a lot, I mean the rent when we originally performed at the top of that building was in high 60s to low 70s and then high 80s to low 90s now. And the [indiscernible] increase was 2% to 2.5% and now it\u2019s 3% plus. So we\u2019re getting paid for it. Jed Reagan : Thanks, and then separately one other question. A few of your peers have been buying back stock recently and just curious to get your latest thought on that strategy for BXP versus development and may be other uses of capital? Owen Thomas : We think development is more accretive for shareholders. As I mentioned, we are launching these projects, our existing development portfolio is generating about a 7% cash yield. And depending on how you look at it, we think our stock is trading in the low-5s on cap rate basis. So we clearly think it trades at discount to NAV but they yield is very different from where the dollars are that we are investing in development. Jed Reagan : Okay. Thank you guys. Operator : And your next question comes from John Guinee with Stifel. John Guinee : Thank you. Turning a little bit, you guys have been pretty active in the multifamily development business a very different business for you, low on releasing cost, low on CapEx on the second generation. How much do you like that business going forward and do you think that\u2019s going to become a more important integral part of your business? Michael LaBelle : John we like it. We started in the business as you know by developing on a mix used sites where we would acquire the site and/or entitle the site and it would have a multifamily component and I think in the far past history of Boston Properties these sites were generally sold. But we started developing them ourselves. We were successful. We have made money on it, not just on paper we sold the Avenue in Washington DC for a very significant profits for Boston Property\u2019s shareholders. So I think we demonstrated the ability to do it and as we run across and we come across sites most of the time they are going to be in some way associated with our office development, but not always. And if it is a site that we believe and we think we can generate the kinds of yields that we have been talking about we are going to continue to grow it. John Guinee : And then a question for you Doug, Boston I think you talked by immigration which is helping grow demand if I have got that right. What industries are coming to Boston and from where are they coming? Doug Linde : So for the most part it\u2019s both the what I referred was life science companies and they are coming from out of state as well as the suburbs. And then there are some technology companies and they are coming predominantly from the suburban locations. And those are locations in the greater 128 area. So Lexington and Waltham and [indiscernible] and places like that. But interestingly, there are other growing tenants in those same submarkets they are grabbing the space that\u2019s coming available. So there is incremental net organic demand and new business activity in the suburb of Boston, the deal where you were starting that is absorbing the state as these other tenants are moving into the city. John Guinee : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Craig Mailman from KeyBanc. Craig Mailman : Hi guys. Owen maybe just going back to your commentary about the ability to fund new development with data at this point not really impact leverage. I'm just curious at this point in the cycle maybe what is the high end of your towers range on debt-to-EBITDA versus looking to accelerate asset sales or [indiscernible] at the joint ventures? Michael LaBelle : I will answer that Craig just so can an answer something. So right now our debt-to-EBITDA is in the mid-6s and our [indiscernible] are desired targeted range, its somewhere plus or minus seven, based upon the delivery of the development that we have going on and when the NOI comes on its going to reduce our net debt-to-EBITDA to six times or even maybe below six times. So as we look out at this development that we have planned plus adding some more that might happen. We feel very comfortable that we can stay below seven the entire time. There may be blips like for example in the first quarter of 2018 we are likely to blip above seven, because we are not going get any income from Salesforce Tower and all the money is going to be out. But then it\u2019s going to come right back down through 2018. So we think that we have the ability to use debt to fund the foreseeable pipeline that we have without needing to raise any equity. Craig Mailman : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then Doug your commentary on kind of where higher price deals in New York could go. Just curious, do you think there could be enough activity coming back to the east side to kind of change the narrative about the center of Manhattan shifting west. Doug Linde : I\u2019m going to be honest with you, I think it\u2019s already happening. There were two institutions on the financial side, two banks that took additional space and what I refer to a traditional midtown not the far west side. And there are three or four major other transactions that we expect will happen in the first quarter. And people will say \u201cjeez I guess the east side hasn\u2019t quite lost its cluster.\u201d I mean quite frankly the fact of the matter is that there is no real estates in the Hudson Yard any longer, it\u2019s all new construction. The next building are coming online, until 2022 plus there is available space downtown in the buildings that are currently under construction or recently completed. And I think people are feeling really good still about midtown Manhattan and there is significant amount of traditional tenancy that still values the grand central station and the east side amenity. And so we are pretty confident and again the amount of activity that we have seen in the last quarter or so at 399 now that we are showing a finished product predominantly and 159 where the skin is on and people can walk around and they can feel what we are doing and they are seeing what the likely common areas are going to look like. We are getting a great reaction and people are encouraged and a lot of this is growth. Craig Mailman : Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Rob Simone with Evercore ISI. Robert Simone : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Owen in your opening remarks and then Doug later on, both made reference to obviously smartly expanding your presence in LA. And Doug you used the term near future. I was just wondering if you guys could elaborate on that. Is there anything specific that you are working on? And then I have a quick follow-up if there is time. Owen Thomas : Yes, we are always working on new business in LA. Jon Lange is on the phone as well and we are thrilled to have Jon in the Company, he has really helped us to have some boots on the ground and highs in years on the ground. So we have ambition, but I have said many times we are going to do it in a profitable manner. We are not going to grow for the sake of growth. We have we think a nice profit in the Colorado Center acquisition and we are going to similarly seek to make profitable investments in LA. We are looking at some development things. We are looking at some existing acquisitions. It\u2019s not an easy time to do this. I talked about a deal that\u2019s sold in El Segundo for a mid to high-4s cap rate and nearly $600 a square foot. So it\u2019s not an easy time to buy existing products, but we are hopeful through development and perhaps repositioning that we will continue to grow in LA. Robert Simone : Great, thanks Owen. And then on the follow-up for just kind of shifting a little bit to 399 Park. This might be kind of hard question to answer. But in your guy\u2019s internal planning, what probability do you guys or what timing do you guys describe to either all or more likely some subset of the proposal that are currently changing hands. And if those leases hit your targets, when should investors think about cash NOI or cash rents starting to hit your P&L? Owen Thomas : The third or fourth quarter of 2019 for when the cash is going to hit the majority of it, and then our full run rate basis obviously 2020, right, so because you are going to get part partial year. And we feel really good about our prospect. I don\u2019t like to sort of give a probability number out there, but we are in lease discussions, actively lease discussions which means that we have letters of intent that are being pushed back and forth multiple times. We have lots of interest in the building, there are literally more than two or three tours a week on the low rise of that space and we could have lightning in a bottle and have a hand shake with somebody in two days or it could take us to two months. I just can't give a good approximation on that. Jon Lange : Yes, this is Jon. The building is looking really good now, the side work is about 80% done, the storefronts done, we are going to finish off the entrance in the next month or two, the city is out, we demolished some of the floors so there is a reason why it's all happening now. Robert Simone : Got it. Thanks guys. Owen Thomas : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Jamie Feldman : Great, thank. I'm just hoping to get your latest thoughts on consolidation and just space per employee where do you think we are in that part of the cycle as you are seeing REIT leasing pickup in your market? Doug Linde : This is going to sound like a little bit of cant answer. It depends on the industry group. We continue to see on a marginal basis major law firms who haven't had a lease that was \u201cstruck\u201d in the last decade, continue to reduce their square footage, I mean the lease that we signed in 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue is a significant reduction in the overall footprint of the tenants that\u2019s moving into that building. So those things are going to continue to occur. On the technology and the life science side, I would say that the densities have gotten about as low as they are going to get. People are starting to sort of push back on that. We have described sort of the issues that there our major tenants in San Francisco salesforce.com thinks about in terms of how they are building out their space. They are exceedingly focused on collaboration areas which means that there are more areas that are devoted to gathering and left the areas that we devoted to \u201ceither\u201d a desktop or on office or tabletop. So we don\u2019t think there is much in the way of compression that is going to be going on in those locations. And then businesses are expanding, they are hiring new people, you look at the unemployment rates across our major markets and you see a dearth of available labor and so people are clearly grabbing every employee that\u2019s around. And so that means that they expanding which means that they are taking additional space. Jamie Feldman : Okay if I could just ask a follow-up on the comment you just made in terms of its just hard to find people. When we read about where that\u2019s the biggest challenge it does seem to be in your markets. Can you just talk about your thoughts on long-term job growth in kind of your coastal markets and I think that might impact. Owen Thomas : Yes, I will give it a shot. Well this is crystal ball time. I'm not sure how valuable this will be. Look, this is related to economic growth, the job creation is going to be related to GDP growth and there are lots of experts out there that predict whenever sessions going to occur I'm not sure we are exactly able to do that. I did provide some data at the Investor Conference last year that showed we are long in this cycle from a timing standpoint, but we are not long in this cycle from a net job creation standpoint. And then also I talked in my remarks about the Tax Reform and what impact that will have on the economy. So Jamie I wish I could be more specific with you, I don\u2019t think we know exactly when the next recession is going to occur. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s near-term and I think job creation will follow that. And in the markets that are in we believe magnets for employment. So when younger people, graduate from a university there with a PhD or a masters or a BA they are going to markets where there are the most opportunities for jobs and job growth, and those happen to be the markets that we are in and the universities are trying to make sure that they are providing the right skill sets for these types of workers. I mean clearly I\u2019m surprised no one has asked about it, but I will bring it up. I mean Amazon is saying that they are going to go to a new city and hire 50,000 people over a 10 year period of time. That\u2019s a lot of people. And when you have a 2% or 2.5% or 3% unemployment rate, you wonder where those people are going to come form and presumably they are going to come from certain companies that are no longer viable, that are going to have an exit. And then migration from other parts of the country into those markets where the jobs are most plentiful. And that\u2019s I think we\u2019re seeing happening in the markets like San Francisco. Jamie Feldman : Okay. I appreciate your thoughts. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Nick Yulico from UBS. Nicholas Yulico : Hi, thanks. I was just hoping to get an update on the NOI bridge, how far along are you now on a leased percentage and where might you end 2018? Owen Thomas : So this is like a torture question, right. I purposely didn\u2019t bring up to that word because I was hoping that we would never have to talk about it again. So big picture if you really care. So the numbers are $155 million, there is $86 million that\u2019s signed, there is $10 million that\u2019s pretty close, the incremental contribution from 399 is between $40 million and $45 million. The rest of it\u2019s from EC, Gateway, General Motors building and Colorado Center and that gets you to a $155 million. And all of it is going to show up in our same-store result and our occupancy and that\u2019s hopefully the way we\u2019re going to sort of address it on a going forward basis. Nicholas Yulico : Okay. So you are not going to give where you are on the leased percentage right now? Owen Thomas : I can\u2019t tell you on a square footage basis because we never sort of think about that way, we think about it on a revenue basis. I mean you can ask me the question every quarter and if I have the numbers and I\u2019m happy to give them to you, but we are moving into sort of saying okay we have given you an 2018 number we have given you a 2019 number. We told you when all this stuff is going to come online. And you will know when we do a lease at 399 because we\u2019ll tell you I promise. And that will be the biggest contribution to getting us really close to the ultimate objective. Nicholas Yulico : Okay, alright. Fair enough. Just one another question. Mike going back to the guidance, you mentioned $5 million of higher straight line rents. Wanted to be clear, is that just free rent related to leases already signed and then what is the potential for seeing additional straight line rent benefit in 2018 if you get more leasing done. Based on our vacancies, is there any space that could be delivered to a tenant this year and commence free rent? Michael LaBelle : I think that\u2019s how we get to the high end of the guidance range. There certainly is projections that we have of things that hopefully will happen, where we will sign leases for either its starting phase or vacant space and we will get started and we will have a free rent period. Certainly the increase in the guidance is associated with leasing activity that we have or believe we are definitely going to get that has free rent period. So the vast majority of all of the straight line, is free rent. Owen Thomas : And I guess I want to make one other point about free rent. So there are different kinds of free rent. There is free rent which is a conception to a tenant where once they start their actual occupancy in the space that they have a period of time when they are not paying. And that\u2019s Washington DC free rent. Free rent in New York City and free rent in the Boston market are we sign a lease, we deliver the space, the tenant is building out the space over a period of time and during that period of time we are recognizing revenue because of the condition of the space. So there is a subtlety there that\u2019s important to understand. Nicholas Yulico : That\u2019s helpful, I guess it is on 399 Park, is there any other space that would fit that potential to get if you got more lease signings done, it had more free rent this year? Doug Linde : I think I talked about that before and it\u2019s a good point just to bring up which is the fact that we won't have that at 399 because of the condition of the space. So Jon described that we're getting a really great look and the reason we are getting a great look from the tenants is because we are demolishing the space and when you demolish a space whereby it\u2019s really not \u201cready\u201d for its intended use. I'm kind of jogging here. You can't straight line it. You basically have to wait unit this space is actually delivered which means interestingly we are at the win to the extent that tenant is delayed and they are building out the space in order when we can recognize that revenue even though we may actually have rent commitment. Which again is the situation we have on our new construction in San Francisco, where we are actually receiving cash rents from salesforce.com on a lot of their space that we are not recognizing revenue because the space isn\u2019t build out yet. Nicholas Yulico : Okay. Thank you Doug. Operator : And your next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill. Alexander Goldfarb : Hi good morning. Just two quick questions. First, for Michael about on the dispositions that you guys talked about which includes the one that already closed in DC the 200 million of 300 million. Does that mean there is roughly sort of another $0.05 of loss on annualized basis that\u2019s not in guidance or is there some sort of adjustment already reflected in guidance for what Owen outlined? Michael LaBelle : I mean we don\u2019t have anything else in our guidance for assumed sales. And we haven\u2019t determine what assets they are, some of them might be land, and we do have some excess land that we already have kind of under agreement where it might be being re-entitled or some other things might be happening that we expect to close this year. So that would have almost no impact on our FFO other than the carrying cost of insurance and taxes which is nominal. And there might be a couple of non-core suburban type of assets as well that might have a moderate impact. But at this point we haven't identified and we are still working on kind of determining what assets those might be. So it\u2019s too early to kind of say what the impact might be. Owen Thomas : We do get cash money for those sales you know. Alexander Goldfarb : I know that. the second question. As we heard this morning cash flow is good. Just second question is Owen you mentioned that year end you expect to get to 92, it sounds like if you got all the city space backfill that\u2019s another 100 basis points that gets you to 93\u2026 Operator : We have time for one final question and that question comes from [indiscernible]. Owen Thomas : What is going on. I'm sorry operator we still have the question going on. Owen Thomas : Alex, if you want to start over on the question? Alexander Goldfarb : Yes, can you hear me? Owen Thomas : Yes, we got you. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay, great. So on the occupancy side, Owen, I think you said you expect to get to year end 92% if you backfill City that gets you another 100 basis points next year to 93%. Do you think that you guys could get towards 95% or there are structural things about the portfolio meaning tenants always moving in moving out that probably like that 93-ish may be sort of your max versus getting closer to 95% given all the demand in the market right now? Owen Thomas : I think that we should be able to get to 94% to 95% on a run rate basis and most of that is the availability we have in Manhattan. So that you add a 200,000 square feet we have at 159 and you add 500,000 plus square feet we have at 399 which should be leased on a long-term basis. But overall, expiration schedule that we are looking at for - and I showed you just when we did our Investor Conference, so if you look at those slides you can see it, for 2019 through 2020 it\u2019s pretty light. So we should get there by the end of next year. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Vincent Chao : Hey. Good morning, Owen. Just going back to development conversation, obviously a lot of success on leasing there, adding few more projects. But I was just curious and we\u2019re hearing a lot about labor shortages as well as rising construction costs, I haven\u2019t heard you guys really change your development yield expectations recently. So I\u2019m just curious I guess the implications that rent growth is keeping up with construction, but curious if you can comment on what kind of construction cost increases you have seen over the past year and then also what you are seeing from just availability of labor on the construction side? Owen Thomas : So I think I made a comment earlier on one of the reasons the tenant improvements are going up is because it\u2019s just costing a lot more to build out space, which is I think a statement that we see significant inflation in the construction industry. When we do our base buildings, when we are making a bid on a project, sometimes we are actually bid it on the formula basis, so the tenants paying a percentage of a factor on what the actual costs are, so it sort of moves. But in most cases, when we bid a building and we provide a rent to somebody, what we have done is we have built in cost escalation into our construction component in our development budget. And over the last call it three or four years, we have been building in anywhere 3% and 6% depending upon the marketplace on annual basis for that component of the project cost. Vincent Chao : Okay. And then in terms of just overall availability, are you running into issues finding enough labor? Owen Thomas : Yes so honestly that\u2019s the reason for the escalation for the most part is labor shortages. And so you have contractors who are working with subcontractors who are bidding to lose in fact we are saying well we will do the job by. And I think one of the advantages that Boston Properties has is that we are a perpetual user of labor in our markets with our contractors and with our subcontractors, and we have an impeccable reputation with regards to making payments on time, treating our subcontractors well, dealing with changed orders appropriately. And because of that I don\u2019t want to say we get preferential pricing, but we certainly get preferential access to the subs who want to do work and know that if they do work with us in a good market they are also going to be able to do work with us in a bad market. So we have not had a procurement problem on any of our jobs. Vincent Chao : Okay, got it. And then I know you guys have been pretty clear that you are not going to use equity to fund any of the development needs here, but just curious in 2018 I know the development pipeline shows 1.4 billion of remaining funding needs but that obviously goes up with some of these projects that you have recently added or will be added shortly. Curious what the total CapEx budget is for 2018, how much do you actually think you will spend in 2018? Michael LaBelle : So this is capital on the existing portfolio as oppose to development spend? Vincent Chao : No, no development spend specifically. Michael LaBelle : 2018 something around $800. Vincent Chao : 800 million. Okay and then just maybe one last one. Owen you mentioned you are not concerned about a material increase in rates in 2018. But I guess what you consider material increase? I mean I guess is 3% still within that limit or how much - can you provide some color on that? Owen Thomas : Yes. Predicting rates is obviously parallel, but I think material would be something significantly over 3%. Vincent Chao : Significantly over 3%. Okay, thank you. Owen Thomas : That\u2019s where I would say it would be material. Vincent Chao : Right. Arista Joyner : Okay, thank you for your time and attention and interest in Boston Properties. That concludes the call. Michael LaBelle : Thanks everyone. Owen Thomas : Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks. Owen Thomas : Okay. Thank you, Arista. And good morning, everyone. We had another very productive quarter and continue to make steady progress with our growth plan. The highlights for the last quarter include, we generated FFO per share of $0.01 above the midpoint of our prior forecast and raised the midpoint of our full year 2018 guidance by $0.02. We leased 2.1 million square feet, which is significantly above our long-term quarterly averages for this period. We signed an 850,000 square foot lease agreement with Fannie Mae for a 1.1 million square foot development at Reston Gateway in Reston Town Center and in the last week we committed to purchase the Santa Monica business park in West L.A. and we achieved our energy, water and emissions intensity reduction goals three years early and establish new more aggressive goals for 2025. So moving to the environment. Importantly for our business economic conditions continue to be healthy and relatively stable. The overall outlook for US GDP this year remains positive with growth projected to reach approximately 2.8%. Job creation remains steady with 616,000 jobs created in the first quarter and employment is stable at 4.1%. While an economic downturn will eventually arrive, it is very difficult to forecast its timing and certainly doesn't feel imminent. Though their hawkish tones in the fixed income markets with the Fed increasing short term interest rates and the U.S. fiscal deficit widening, the yield curve has been flattening with the 10 year U.S. Treasury rate rising around 50 basis points this year. Though we expect further Fed rate hikes in 2018, global rates and inflation continue to be low and we anticipate relatively modest increases in long-term U.S. interest rates in the near term. The office markets and sub markets where we operate continue to remain in general equilibrium. The new deliveries are outpacing net absorption. Overall net absorption for our five markets this quarter was 4.7 f million square feet, while deliveries were 8.3 million. The vacancy rate in our markets remains relatively low at 8.8% [ph] which increased the modest 40 basis points this quarter, while asking rents grew by 0.4%. Leasing activity remains quite healthy with broad based activity across multiple industries. In the private real estate market significant office transaction volume ended the first quarter at just over $20 billion, which is down 27% from the first quarter of '17. However we see a healthy supply of offerings and anticipate the decreasing volumes to stabilize later in the year. Commercial real estate continues to see interest from both domestic and international investors and cap rates remain healthy in our core markets. Yet again, there were numerous significant asset transactions in our markets this past quarter. In Boston, 28 State Street is under agreement to sell for $739 a square foot and a 4.8% initial cap rate to a domestic pension adviser. This is a 570,000 square foot building and it's full - more or less fully leased. In New York, Chelsea Market sold for $2000 a square foot to Google's parent company Alphabet. The building is 1.2 million square feet and fully leased with Google occupying around 400,000 square feet. Also in midtown New York, Manhattan tower which is located directly across the street from our 599 Lexington Avenue property sold for just over a $1000 a square foot and up 4.3% initial cap rate. This 300,000 square foot building is 99% leased and was sold to a domestic insurance holding company. And there are a number of transactions in the pipeline expected to close in the second quarter. Moving to our capital activity, with the sale of 500 E Street, we are on track - we are on track to sell 200 to 300 million in non-core assets this quarter. On acquisitions, we continue to pursue value added opportunities in our core markets with a focus on L.A. In line with this strategy, our big news this week as we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire Santa Monica business Park, a 47 acre 1.2 million square foot office in retail campus in the ocean Park neighborhood of Santa Monica California. This site is comprised of 15 office and six retail buildings and is 94% leased. Unlike the myriad of 200,000 square foot or less buildings that we've been offered in West L.A. over the last few years, this is our kind of project, given its scale, its suitability to larger corporate tenants, the redevelopment opportunities that could present themselves over time and the changing positive dynamics of the location over the next decade, given the potential decommissioning of the Santa Monica Airport. It is possible that we will bring a capital partner into the investment. With this acquisition we will double the size of our Los Angeles portfolio at 2.4 million square feet and will own a critical mass in Santa Monica with 24% of the competitive office space in the market. This transaction is obviously an important next step in our strategy to grow Boston Properties presence in the Los Angeles market. Development continues to be our primary strategy for creating value for shareholders. We remain very active with several new pre-lease projects either committed or under pursuit. We signed a lease agreement with Fannie Mae this quarter for approximately 850,000 feet to anchor 1.1 million square foot two tower office complex at Reston Gateway. Reston Gateway is a 22 acre site located immediately south of Reston Town Centers urban core and west of our Discovery Square and Reston Corporate Center Property. The site is also directly adjacent to the future Reston Town Center Metro station anticipated to open in 2020, which will connect Reston via the Silver Line to both Washington D.C. and Dulles Airport. With this lease, we're kicking off the first part of our multi-phase development of Reston Gateway which could ultimately contain 3.5 million square feet of space. In addition to the two office buildings anchored by Fannie Mae, future plans for the western portion of the Reston Gateway site include a mid-sized hotel over 600,000 square feet of residential and approximately 90,000 square feet of ground floor retail all complementing the amenity base and community environment of the highly successful Reston Town Center. Fannie Mae will be an occupancy in the first quarter of 2022. Additionally, we have signed an LOI and are working on a final agreement to purchase a minority stake in a site at 3 Hudson Boulevard in partnership with the Moinian Group, the current owner. This site supports a 2 million square foot office building and is located on Hudson Boulevard adjacent to a park and the nearly completed seven train entrance. Boston Properties would assume operational control of the co-development. Construction on the foundation for the redesigned tower is underway and we anticipate commencing vertical construction upon execution of an anchor tenant lease. And lastly, as Doug will cover in a moment, we also have active lease discussions under what Cambridge and Boston that could lead to additional near term development start. So with all that, our current development pipeline stands at 13 office and residential developments and redevelopments comprising 6.5 million feet and $3.5 billion of investment. Most of the pipeline is well underway and we have $1.4 billion remaining to fund. The commercial component of this portfolio is 83% pre-leased, an aggregate projected cash yield are approximately 7%. This pipeline by the way excludes the previously discussed 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue and Fannie Mae developments which we expect to commence later in 2018. We are winning significant new development business based on the quality of our sites, our team and execution, not by lowering our return requirements. Further, we expect to fund all this new development without raising equity or increasing our company leverage - level given the debt capacity made available to us through our near term development deliveries. Most notably the Salesforce Tower. So to summarize on capital strategy, our best use of capital today is launching new pre-lease development and making select value added acquisitions for which the yields are higher than both stabilized property acquisitions and the inferred cap rate in repurchasing our shares, notwithstanding their material discount to NAV. Our best and cheapest source of capital is debt financing, which we can utilize without materially changing our credit profile due to the new debt capacity provided by the income from our development deliveries. We have and will continue to self-select non-core assets, which raises marginal capital. The sale of larger core assets is a less efficient funding source given significant embedded tax gains and result in special dividend requirements. Lastly, we continue to emphasize and execute on our sustainability strategy by pursuing conservation measures that have positive economic and environmental outcomes. We recently updated our energy, water and greenhouse gas emissions intensity reduction goals, as we exceeded our 2020 targets three years early. Our new goals establish a bolder reduction targets for energy and water use, as well as emissions by 2025. To conclude, we remain confident with our plan to materially increase our NOI starting in 2019 through development deliveries and leasing up our existing assets from approximately 90% to 93% and longer term growth is now becoming more clear and likely given all the new developments we've added and expect to add to our pipeline. So over to Doug. Doug Linde : Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. When I have a conversation with any of our tenants or our investors or anybody else who's interested in the real estate market, the first question they always ask is, so how is your business. How are you doing? And my response right now is that Boston Properties is as busy as we have ever been. We have strong leasing activity at our 46 million square foot operating portfolio. As Owen said, we're an active construction on $3.5 billion of new developments, 83% pre-leased and we've entered into new leases on additional development which will lead to an additional $1.1 billion of new office developments. Our primary customer, large real estate users, public or private or start-up are established are exhibiting confidence by making the decisions to upgrade and consolidate their space and in some cases they are expanding. We just opened our second residential development in Reston in January. We've leased 86 out of 508 units. We are going to open our second Boston area residential building in Cambridge in June and we've already leased 31 out of 244 market rate units. And if the conversation I'm having is with an investor, I hammer gently with a finished nail not a big stick one, how we will experience meaningful FFO growth from occupancy gains and our development deliveries during 2019 and 2020. Now obviously there are some nuances in individual markets which we'll talk, but in short, our short and medium term opportunity set feels really good and things feel great. Now there have been some market conditions changes since our January call and the most significant have been in midtown New York City. JPMorgan's decision to remain and grow on Park Avenue and 47 Street has changed the conversation amongst the New York City real estate community. Instead of talking about the migration west or the demise of Park Avenue, the commentary has shifted to movement not based on location, but rather on new construction and capital investment. In fact, I've seen one recent broker's report that suggests that more than two thirds of all of the relocations in Manhattan in 2016 and '17 were to new product or buildings that have received significant capital infusions. Additionally, the reduction of available space, primarily at 390 Madison required by the JPMorgan enabling move has provided some real tightening to the Park Avenue market. The results have been a change in mood and a firming of lease economics. And as it happens, the leasing activity in Manhattan in the late 2017 and 2018 is being led by the fire sector which enjoys the advantages that Midtown offers. We have completed almost 190,000 square foot of leases during the quarter, including another full floor law firm expansion in our midtown portfolio, in the tower section of 399 Park, we have leased the 25,000 square foot floor and we have three leases outstanding totaling 135,000 square feet and over 400,000 square feet of proposals on the remaining space. At the base of the building, we have nearly a million square feet of proposal for 260,000 square feet of availability. We have a lease out for the entirety of our 159 East 53rd Street redevelopment and 30,000 square feet of leases in progress on the remaining 34th and 33rd floors at the General Motors building which takes up about two thirds of that space. Our New York City portfolio is well positioned to gain significant occupancy and revenue during the latter half of '19. Construction at Dock 72 is progressing and we expect to deliver space so we work this quarter with an expected completion of their work and the amenity space in early '19. While we are showing the space the Brooklyn large tenant activity has been light and tenants have more of a just in time perspective. So we don't anticipate much leasing until the amenities spaces are close to completion. Market fundamentals continue to improve in San Francisco, as the availability of new product becomes scarcer and scarcer and the technology of tenants continue to expand. Park Tower is in active discussions for the majority if not all of that 750,000 square foot building. The next new product will be first in mission in 2022 or beyond and a 270,000 square foot rehab expansion which has not yet started, but it's expected to commence this year at 633 Folsom. Large blocks of contiguous available space are going to come in the form of space coming from tenants that are moving to new construction, the Dropbox sublet at 345 333 Brannan, Salesforce at Rinc\u00f3n Center, 50 Beale, once Blue Cross, Blue Shield relocates to Oakland. As we move into 2018, our CBD activity is going to be focused upon 80,000 square foot of space that we have at EC1 that resulted from a tenant relocation to Salesforce Tower where we have leases in negotiation for about 70,000 square feet and four non-contiguous floors at EC4 and then some early renewals. We've increased the leasing at Salesforce Tower to 98% this quarter and we have a leasing negotiation on the final available floor, all non-tech users are filling up the rest of Salesforce Tower. It's important to note that full floor, financial or business service demand is not as robust as the Tecla growth in the city. And while there has been significant increase in rent for large blocks of availabilities, geared towards the tech tenant, rent growth in the older towers has trailed the new inventory. The Silicon Valley has also had a pickup in activity. The existing classic inventory is being absorbed. The latest mega deal being a million square foot leased at Moffett Towers and Sunnyvale for buildings that will be delivered in '19. We did two deals totaling 64,000 square feet this quarter at our single story product in Mountain View where the average rent increased 25% and starting rents are close to $56, triple net, single storey product. My remarks for the D.C. market continue to follow three themes. First, matching site and tenants together to launch new development, which is the heart of our DC franchise. Last quarter it was 210 Penn and Leidos at 1715 in Reston, the previous quarter it was Marriott and Bethesda [ph] and the TSA and as Owen discussed this quarter it's a Fannie Mae transaction and Reston Town Center 3, otherwise known as Reston Gateway. The second theme is the strength of the Reston Town Center market, as a magnet for private sector contractors and technology tenants. We continue to see strong end demand. We have recently signed two expansion and extension deals with technology tenants for 112,000 square feet. One tenant grew 30% and the other grew 40%. And we are negotiating a third expansion and extension this time growing 115,000 square feet tenant to a 160,000 square feet. We are also in early renewal discussions with tenants for more than 300,000 square feet of space. And finally in D.C. on the margin, the omnibus budget is a positive development for the CBD market because it includes billions of dollars of increased spending for non-dispense sectors of the economy and the government. It's unclear how much will flow into new job creation and translate into increased GSA or contractor demand or when it will lead to additional leasing. But it's a net positive. Now there will be and has been and are going to be an abundance of partially leased recently renovated CBD assets, and the market will continue to be highly competitive. In Boston, the market continues to improve. As good as our activity is in New York City or San Francisco NBC, in Boston we completed 33 transactions totaling over 400,000 square feet this quarter and overall the percentage lease in our Boston Regional Office assets is the strongest in the company at 95%. When we started the quarter we had six floors of availability on our entire CBD portfolio. Five of those floors are now leased. Our largest negotiation in the region now involves a piece of space that expires in 2022. We have signed retail users for 30,000 square feet of the Hub spaced over the garden which gets us to over 90% of the retail space committed and we're now at 88% of that total project leased. Demand for space in the city of Boston continues to grow as technology tenants are expanding at pace that we've never seen, and it's as strong as we have ever seen it. With our lease with Rapid7 at the Hub on Causeway and the remaining space at Pier 4 being committed most of - not all of the new existing inventory under construction begun. In addition, Amazon and Wayfair are close to very significant expansions in the Seaport and the Back Bay and we continue to work with an anchor tenant for the tower at the Hub on Causeway. In Cambridge where we have a limited availability, we continue to have discussions with a tenant for the next office development at Kendall Center. If this project moves forward we will replace 115,000 square foot building with a 400,000 square foot tower with construction commencing in mid-2019 and across the street on Main Street MIT is reportedly in conversation for all of their office inventory. Even as many tenants are attracted to the city centers of Boston and Cambridge, there continues to be significant demand in our Waltham Lexington suburban portfolio. We are in lease negotiations for the entire availability at Reservoir North 73,000 square feet with a tenant that's coming out of a 30,000 square foot building and we are talking to an existing tenant at CityPoint that would grow from 22,000 square feet to 47,000 square feet expanding at 20 CityPoint. Starting with new construction are over $50 a square foot in a suburb, while Class A existing product ranges from the low 40s to the mid-40s. I'm going to conclude my remarks this morning with some comments about our same property leasing statistics for the quarter. You will note a jump in transaction costs. This is true across all our markets and illustrates the concession the market has been giving for the last few years for leases of 10 plus years, as well as the cost of pre-built suites, which we have been describing for the last couple of years. Obviously there's a trade-off with accelerating occupancy on pre-built which is not reflected in these numbers. If you save six months of downtime on a $90 rented space it reduces the transaction cost of the deal by $45, but that doesn't show up in these statistics. Overall, on a mark-to-market basis, we were up about 13%. However there were some real variety and variability there. In Boston the roll up came primarily from our Cambridge portfolio, a transaction I described last quarter where we took back space from Microsoft and re-let it. And the roll down in New York City comes from a full floor seven year renewal and the low right portion of the General Motors building that was done in January of 2015 and hit the statistics this quarter where the rent went from $150 a square foot to $116 a square foot, but there was only a $20 of square foot tenant improvement allowance. So all these numbers are confusing and there's always a story behind them. With that, I'm going to stop and let the call go to Mike. Michael LaBelle : Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning. Hope you all are as excited as we are about our revamped supplemental financial package. If you haven't looked, hopefully you'll check it out, we've reorganized and reformatted it to make it much easier to read. There are a couple of accounting related items I want to point out that changes in our financial disclosure this quarter. First one is due to the change in the FASBs rules for revenue recognition that we adopted this quarter, we've included on our income statement both the payroll expense and the reimbursement income for payroll costs for management service contracts. These items which each totaled $2.9 million for the quarter offset each other and net to zero and they will net to zero each quarter. Previously we had simply netted the expense against the reimbursement. The other item is on our financial highlights page, where we are now disclosing our capitalized internal leasing costs and external legal costs related to leasing. This totaled $1.7 million for the quarter. And the reason I pointed out is that the new lease accounting rules that we will adopt in 2019 will require us to start expensing these costs. I suspect that there will be lots of quarterly variability in this item. So at a minimum I would anticipate $0.04 to $0.06 per share of additional expense to hit our FFO in 2019. Okay. Sorry for the digression into accounting minutiae. As you can see from our press release, we've been very busy this quarter. Owen describes some of our investment activity in asset sales. We've also been active in the debt markets. Last week we closed a $180 million four year construction loan with a syndicate of banks to fund construction of the residential component of our Hub on Causeway development and later this week we expect to close on a $120 million mortgage to refinance our existing loan on 540 Madison Avenue in New York City that expires later this year. We expect to reduce our credit spread on that by 40 basis points and extend for five years. And yesterday we drew down a 100% of our $500 million unsecured term loan that we closed last year. Proceeds will be used to repay our outstanding line of credit balances to fund the equity portion of the Santa Monica business Park acquisition and fund development costs. Turning to our earnings results, we reported funds from operation of a $1.49 per share for the first quarter. That was $2 million or about a penny per share above the midpoint of our guidance. Our share of the NOI from the portfolio exceeded our budget by approximately $4 million or $0.02 per share. The outperformance came from earlier than projected leasing, primarily in Cambridge where we signed a 90,000 square foot new lease to backfill the majority of the 110,000 square feet of space vacated by Microsoft in December and at a much higher rent. That's consistent with what Doug commented on about our lease statistics. And in New York City, we took back a floor at 601 Lexington Avenue from a tenant with a near term expiration, received a payment and leased the space immediately to another tenant. The improvement in the portfolio in OI for the quarter was partially offset by approximately $2 million of higher than projected G&A expense. The increase was due to higher health care costs and higher than projected non-cash stock compensation. As it is every year, our first quarter G&A is higher than subsequent quarter due to the stock competition investing provisions and the timing of payroll taxes. As we look at the rest of 2018, we continue to be encouraged by the level of leasing activity that we're seeing on our vacancy, as well as early renewal opportunities for leases expiring in 2019 through 2022, many of which will have a positive mark-to-market in rent. The activity that Doug described in Boston, the leases in negotiation at 399 Park Avenue and activity on our vacant space at Embarcadero Center all will improve our portfolio occupancy. Some of these deals will take occupancy at the tail end of this year, but the majority of the impact will not be realized until 2019. Based upon what we are experiencing, we're increasing our assumption for the growth in our 2018 NOI from the same property pool by 25 basis points at the midpoint to 1% to 2.5%. We have not modified our same property cash NOI assumptions as these deals typically have free rent periods and inception or the NOI growth is from early renewals where the bump up in cash rent will not occur until the natural lease expiration. We project our non-cash straight line rents will total $60 million to $80 million for 2018, which is up $5 million at the midpoint from last quarter's guidance. We've also increased our projection for development and management services income to $31 million to $36 million for the year, an increase of $2 million at the midpoint. The increase is primarily related to higher service income projections, as well as leasing commissions in our joint ventures and third party managed portfolios. We're adjusting our assumption for G&A expense to $118 million to $121 million for the year. That's up $2 million at the midpoint and mostly due to the impact of the first quarter results. Overall, we are increasing our guidance for 2018 funds from operations by bringing up the low end of our range by $0.04 per share to a new guidance range of $6.27 to $6.36 per share. This equates to a midpoint increase of $0.02 per share and that's due to our assumptions for portfolio NOI, increasing $0.03 per share, fee income increasing $0.01 per share offset by $0.02 per share of higher G&A expense. We have not included the impact of the acquisition of Santa Monica business Park in these assumptions, as we are still finalizing the ultimate capital structure for the deal. However assuming a July 1 closing, we anticipate it will be a creative to our 2018 FFO projections by approximately a penny per share. That completes our formal remarks. Operator, I'd appreciate it if you could open up the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Nick Yulico with UBS. Nick Yulico : Thanks. So I guess, you know first off on Santa Monica Business Park, you know there was some trade publications that have written about the deal. It sounds like there were a lot of parties interested in the site. Can you talk a little bit about how you underwrote the asset? It sounds like there could be some below market leases there that are rolling over the next couple of years, you know, how should we think about the yield on day one versus a more stabilized yields for the project? Owen Thomas : Good morning, Nick. So a couple of things we will say about the pricing. So first of all as Mike mentioned, the deal is accretive to us day one. Let me talk about the yield and let me talk about the per square foot. So on the yield, the initial NOI yield on the asset is somewhere in the mid to high threes, and that is rising to over 6% by year five. I should also mention that roughly 60% of that lift is from leases that have been signed that are - that have not commenced rent payment. So from an income standpoint the profile of this investment is similar to the Colorado Center investment that we made two years ago. But actually there's less leasing risk here, because in Colorado Center we had actual vacancy, whereas here there's a lot of the lift is from again leases that have been signed that are not paying rent yet. Then second on the per square foot. Obviously you can do the math on the square footage and the price that we've disclosed. However, to be apples-and-apples with other transactions that are quoted on the simple basis, roughly 70% of the assets in this park are encumbered by a leasehold interest. We have - in the lease we have a right to purchase at fair market value the ground under those buildings in 10 years. But you wouldn't - to come up with a per square foot number you would need to add what you believe the fair market value of the land is. Nick Yulico : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Owen. I guess just then in terms of turning to - back to 399 Park and you talked about, I think you said a million square foot of proposals on the lower floors, where you have that 250,000 square foot block, where it sounded like you were getting close with you know, one financial tenant, but you didn't have an NOI yet for that block. Can you just talk about how that discussion is going? Is that tenant still an option for all the space and you know, how much I guess from a timing standpoint you think it might take to get actual - you know some leasing done for that block? Owen Thomas : I will answer the question and then let John Powers you know, chime in. So we have tenants who are looking for 250,000 square feet, we actually have a proposal out with a tenant who would actually after trying - get us to take some other space back from another tenant, so they would be larger than 250,000 square feet and then we have a number of tenants who are looking for a floor or a floor plus. So you know the floors that we have available are around 70,000 square feet, so we think tenants are looking for 100,000 square feet, so they would be a floor and a half. I am not smart enough to handicap the physical timing of a lease signing. We are confident that we will have a significant portion of the low rise - of this building leased before the year is over, and that there will be income on this space hopefully by the end of 2019. John, I don't know if you want to add anything to that. John Powers : We certainly would hate to break the block because it's a great block and we have people looking at it, but at some point we have people interested in single floors or two floors and we're going to have to do one of the deals and that's probably going to happen very quickly. Nick Yulico : All right. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Jamie Feldman : Thank you. And good morning. I guess just sticking with Santa Monica Business Park. So now you've got Colorado Center, Santa Monica to get Business Park. I mean how do you think about your desire to grow even more in L.A. at this point or do you feel like now you can digest for a while and see how things play out and how do you think you fit in strategically in that market versus the competition now as a landlord? Doug Linde : So let me let me start with just sort of a real estate perspective Jamie, okay. So you know, when we bought the Colorado Center investment in July of 2016, what was so attractive to us about that investment was that it was our kind of property, meaning Boston Properties kind of property in that these were larger buildings that were leased to or could be leased to larger corporate users who we hope would be the kind of companies that would - that we would want to see grow. And the Santa Monica Business Park fits that same glove. So the park is you know, just over a million one of office space and 15 tenants occupy 920,000 square feet of that space. So it's a very similar kind of a profile to Colorado Center and it really fits with the way we as an organization want to build our business. So just sort of foundationally that's what we like so much about these two assets and I think it's pretty significant that in two years we have you know, as Owens said, we're now you know 20 plus percent, 24% owner of the competitive office supply in Santa Monica, which is a pretty significant way to enter that marketplace. I think it's a little premature at this point to talk about additional growth. Let us divest this particular purchase and put the two together and work these assets. Owen Thomas : Yeah. And. Jamie just to add to what Doug said, look we remain committed to have Los Angeles be one of our five major regions. However we're not going to encumber ourselves with a fixed timetable to do so, we are going to grow with assets that we make - we think make sense for the company and also with assets where we think we're going to make money on the acquisitions. So we're going to be disciplined. We're going to be careful. You know, it took us two years following Colorado Center to find Santa Monica a Business Park. We've been patient. We've been disciplined. We couldn't be more excited to be making this particular investment, we think it fits perfectly for the reasons that Doug described. And going forward we're certainly going to look at new investments, but we're going to do it with the same discipline and care that we've been doing since we started in L.A. Jamie Feldman : Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess just, maybe talk about potential timing if you were to bring in a partner and I think you mentioned an airport redevelopment and also public transit access. Just the timeframe of when all of those come together? Doug Linde : So let me talk about the real estate and let Owen talk about the capital side. So the Santa Monica Business Park is a 47 acre parcel and [indiscernible] the Santa Monica Airport. The Santa Monica Airport is slated at this point to be decommissioned sometime around 2028. That means that that enormous parcel is going to be re adapted to some other use. We expect it will be public uses not commercial uses, but as part of that process we are hoping and again we have not had one conversation with anybody in Santa Monica, the public, the community, the city council because it's way too premature to do that. But we hope that at some point there will be a conversation about how the redevelopment of the Santa Monica Airport and the 47 acre site that we now will own and feed by that point because will help purchase the ground and how we think about changing and thinking about how it could be reconstructed and reconfigured. You know, going forward you know over the next decade or so. So we're really excited about the long-term potential to do something here, not the short term potential. You know, when you guys do your tour in 2018 and you do the tour in 2021, you're not going to see a lot of changes. Because you know we recognize that all the buildings are leased, that there are tenants in the buildings, they are growing tenants. The city of Santa Monica has a long way away from getting that airport back and there - it will have been very few if any conversations with the community with the public officials with the tenants with the neighbors et cetera. So this is all going to be a long-term prospect, but it's a 47 acre parcel in the heart of Santa Monica and it's got a great highway access to the Fed [ph]. Owen Thomas : And Jamie on capital, you know, clearly there are equity capital providers that are interested in this property and we are considering bringing in a partner and we could do that by the time that we close or could be afterward. But it's something that we're considering. Jamie Feldman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi. Michael Bowman : Hey it's Michael Bowman here with Manny. Mike and Doug you both sort of talked about a lot of leasing all coming towards the end of '19. A lot of the efforts that you've been working on development and lease up redevelopment. Mike you also mentioned this lease accounting that's going to knock 2019 FFO by $0.04 to $0.06. I guess at what point do you start looking at consensus, right now assuming at about 695, about 10% growth. You should be annualizing, call it you know, close to 660 by the end of the year. I mean, is there a gap between how you're thinking about that trajectory going to 2019 relative to where the street mindset is currently? Doug Linde : So Michael, this is Doug. We have not spent a lot of time thinking about what the street numbers are for 2019. We're obviously in the third quarter of the year, we - you know, we provide our guidance. We have been providing our development outflow and our expectations of when those dollars will come into the income and the income statement and beyond the balance sheet in service. And that's where the variability of our numbers are, and the question will be how far into '19 that stuff actually you know, impacts that the year. So as an example you know, we have up the Akamai building which we announced a year and a half ago, that's going to be delivered in the fourth quarter. Is it going to get delivered on October 1st or is it going to get delivered on you know, December 15. It's a big deal in terms of what the actual results will be for 2019. So until we get a little bit closer to understanding the actual in-service date for the developments that are coming online, it's hard for us to - with great accuracy provide a 2019 number, which is why we are - we haven't obviously provided one yet and we probably won't until the third quarter. Michael LaBelle : And I think you know, the leasing at 399 makes a big difference as well. The timing of - you know, as we sign these leases we will get better visibility as to the exact timing of when that rent is going to start. And that's obviously a lot of states and a lot of growth that is going to come. So at this point, we're not clear whether it'll be you know, at the beginning of '19, the end of '19, how much square footage is when and where, but that will become - as I said more visible to us as time goes on. Michael Bowman : I'm just thinking about a step function, right. If you're running, it's called a buck fifty two a buck 55 between the first and second quarter based on your guidance for the back half of the year, as call it a buck 65 quarterly. As you think about next year I guess when is the next step up material or should the street be thinking that that buck 65 holds for the first couple of quarters. And then you sort of get a bigger hockey stick towards the end of the year. Because I do think - what I hate to happen is for another year of guidance comes out and it's like - it's below the street again? Michael LaBelle : With the biggest increase towards the back half of this year, I mean, you pointed out a good thing. I mean our FFO for the back half of the year is going to be higher than the first half of the year. And the biggest increase of that is coming from the development pipeline that is coming into service. So we get Salesforce Tower obviously, every quarter they are taking on additional floors and we've got other tenants that we have signed leases in that building that are going to be taking on additional spaces. So we've provided some of that information in our disclosures to you, as that kind of builds up. And then we also have the two residential buildings that are leasing up you know, in the back half of '18 and then through '19. So you know, that helps as well. You know, the same store portfolio has some growth. In the back half of the year you'll see - you know, in the second quarter you're probably going to see another negative same store comparison to prior year because of 399. But as we get into the third and fourth quarter, you're going to see that improve on a comparative basis. And as Doug said, we're not really prepared to give 2019 guidance today. But as we go through the year we'll continue to provide insight on our calls as we see that. Michael Bowman : Right. And next on the Santa Monica, on the yield that you've quoted mid to high threes is that an initial cash going in or is that a gap. And then can you give at least some details around the ground lease in terms of you know, what is the ground lease expense and as we start to think about sort of the expected yield on that purchase of the land? Michael LaBelle : So just a couple of things. You're not going to like all the answers I give you, but that's okay. So the yield that Owen quoted were past yield. So they had not had GAAP impacts at all. And so he said you know, in the mid to high threes going to the sixes over five years. Those yield included the cost of the ground rent embedded in it. And so when we figure out the capital structure and all the accounting issues associated with how we need to treat this stuff, we will provide better disclosure on the various components that are in our package. But we're there yet. I mean, this thing has been going quickly and literally you know, signed our contract with Diego [ph] Michael Bowman : Right. I'm just thinking that land per square foot costs are going to be pretty elevated in that basis and so the market value of the land, you know, from a yield perspective, the cash yield perspective I got to imagine is well below that 3% range? Michael LaBelle : No, it's actually not. You know, that you're thinking about it in the wrong way. The way the ground leased currently is structured, it's pretty expensive ground lease, and when that ground lease goes away we think the yield will be enhanced actually. Michael Bowman : Even though you have to pay market value for the land? Michael LaBelle : Yes. Michael Bowman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks for taking the question. Just sort of a little bit more detail sort of the NOI bridge going into '19 and '20, if you look at sort of the buildings that are maybe key components of the bridge, obviously 399 Park and you mentioned there's some variability in timing. Can you talk about sort of visibility in lease up potentially at 611 Gateway and maybe Embarcadero? Doug Linde : Yes. So our visibility at Embarcadero Center is very strong. We have you know, a lot of proposals that we're working on, a lot of leases that are in negotiation and so we're very comfortable with the expectations that we've set on in terms of what Embarcadero Center is going to contribute. 611 Gateway. We've actually - I would say we've been very measured in our view on what's going to happen there. And so we've - you know, our perspective has been that we've been leasing somewhere between 40,000 and 60,000 square feet a year and assuming that that pace is kept up well, you know, we'll be where and we need to be by the end of 2020 on that one. The fundamental driver at this point of all of our \u201coperational\u201d occupancy increase is at 399 Park Avenue, everything else effectively has really gotten committed and on the margin that's where you know, where the big uncertainty is in terms of actual leases being signed relative everything - everything else in the portfolio. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And then maybe just sticking to New York. You know, we've obviously - you've quoted a very robust private market with cap rates holding up. But many names focused and - on New York still traded pretty big discounts to NAV. Maybe gives you a sense of you know, where are we - have you seen a move in cap rates for any - for certain types of assets within the New York market? And just related to that you also referenced a comment about capital allocation and buybacks, maybe just give us some thoughts around that as well? Thank you. Doug Linde : Well, on the private equity market for real estate, we try to spend time on this call every quarter trying to demonstrate that Class A buildings in our core markets are trading - you know the per foot vary based on the rents, but the cap rates are generally in the fours. They are usually in the low fours for buildings I assume that have some lease up or some - that are leased below market and are there in the high fours. But that is generally been consistent and we didn't see a change this quarter and there are actually a number of other deals that I didn't mention that we hear are either under agreement or becoming committed that are going to also mirror that cap rate. So my expectation is next quarter I'm going to be quoting to you again three or four deals that are going to be you know, cap rates in the four. So I think the market remained strong. Your point and question on capital allocation, you know, we are doing - as I said in my remarks, we think our best use of capital today is the new pre-lease development that we're launching and value added acquisitions. You know, our development pipeline is at $3.5 billion, its 82% pre-leased. So it's been materially derisk and also as I mentioned our development pipeline is currently priced at around a 7% yield. I talked about the Santa Monica investment generating over a six yield in five years. You know, our stock does traded discount NAV and depending on how you think about valuing the development pipeline and by the way we give you some data on how we think you should do that, but we see our stock trading in the low fives, you know, from a cap rate perspective. So that's why I made the remark that we think a better use of our investing capital is the development and the value added acquisition. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jordan Sadler : Hi. Its Jordan Sadler here. I wanted to touch base on SNBP [ph] one more time, going in cash flow yield is quite low. But it seems based on these ramps and the potential to the purchases of the land in 10 years that the unlevered IRR could be pretty high relative to what you'd expect for something in this type of a market, supply constrained market. I'm curious what you think the IRR would look like and then maybe any commentary on what the competition for this asset look like and why you guys were the right buyer, as opposed to you know, some of the cheaper sources of capital out there? Owen Thomas : Yeah. Look, I think the IRR was attractive to us relative to the other investments that we've looked at in West L.A. and frankly across the country. So we were very comfortable with the IRR on this investment. And look, we think is a very attractive property. We think it was a great fit for Boston Properties for all the reasons that Doug and I have described. There's no doubt it was competitive and you know, we won an auction and you know there's a lot of speculation about who the other bidders were that you'd probably read as we have. And so I assume that that is the case. Doug Linde : And just - I'll just give you sort of a general comment on IRR Jordan, which is that, we have been very disciplined and frustrated by the degradation of returns that has occurred in the overall acquisition market in terms of where people have been prepared to pay for things over the last couple of years and we just haven't been able to participate. And our view is that you know, most people have been purchasing assets that are IRR that are in the low sixes. And clearly we have not been participating in that part of the sales market. We hope that this is going to be significantly better than that. Jordan Sadler : Okay. And then regarding 3 Hudson, I haven't heard a lot of follow up commentary on it, is a start or an anchor tenant and then a start there imminent. Can you talk about your investment and your expected return there? Doug Linde : So we are - just to be clear on 3 Hudson Boulevard. This is one where we have not signed a commitment, we have an NOI and we're negotiating a commitment. So we are not prepared to provide as much detail as what we've been talking about in Santa Monica. We're clearly in the market for tenants and we would not commence the vertical development until we secured an anchor commitment. Jon, do you want to provide any more color on that? Jon Lange : Just so they like - that we really like the site you know, its north of the Hudson Yards a little bit, right on the 7 train and it's really on three avenues with 34 Street 11th and Hudson Boulevard. So you had a lot of light now. So we really like - we really like the site. Doug Linde : And our yield requirements are you know in the range of what we are seeking in all of our other rigs - in all of our other regions. Jordan Sadler : Okay. And then last question, just on construction cost, you guys obviously have quite a bit of development underway and are committing to incremental development, could we talk about what you're seeing in construction cost escalation, post-tariff escalation, in other cost labor obviously and how you guys are mitigating those rising costs? Jon Lange : So Jordan, the pre-tariff world, we were seeing escalation of between 3% and 5% on all of our projects across all of our regions. But it differed by the particular trade. So in one reason it might have been concrete and another reason it might have been curtain wall and a third reason it might have been mechanical electrical. What we do when we are building our budgets for our developments, when we are quoting rents, which we have to live with, is that we build an escalation into all of those jobs and generally depending upon the market we're building an escalation between 4% and 6%. So we sort of have - we take a little bit more conservative scope and then we also build in you know change order contingencies and things like that that give us a little bit more in the way of \u201cleg room\u201d for things that could happen. We don't think that on the margin the increases in the - mostly steel, not aluminum tariff that could occur will impact those escalations any more than what's currently in the market today. Jordan Sadler : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Good morning. I guess a question for Michael LaBelle on the balance sheet and you sort of talked about the funding and the debt funding and sort of leverage levels not really moving. Could you just sort of walk us through kind of where you are to kind of net debt to EBITDA is today, kind of walk us through the balance of the debt funding, some of the new projects that maybe haven't started yet, but are committed and sort of where do you see that balance sheet pro forma and maybe I guess three years from now, how do you sort of see the leverage numbers changing? Michael LaBelle : So right now we're at 6.8 net to debt to EBITDA and about $3.5 billion development pipeline, $2 billion is funded, so that's in the debt portion and its generating effectively zero today. So we've got another $1.4 billion of fund and then Doug described another $1 billion plus or minus of other new developments that we're working on. And you know, we'll see how we capitalized Santa Monica Business Part. But you know, as you kind of look at that, I think that in the next quarter or two we may tick up a little bit, but then we're going to come down and as all the cash flow comes in from the development it's going to deliver us. And I feel very confident that we will be in kind of that 6.5 to maybe six and three quarters, plus or minus kind of on a pro forma basis after we get through this. Now obviously a lot can change over the next three years because there's going to be other opportunities, we haven't things like that. But our goal is to make sure that we have enough you know, balance sheet to kind of keep our net debt to EBITDA from going above 7 times actively and that's how we're kind of managing things. And you know, we think about as we look at new investments, do we want to bring in a partner not to that investment because it will enable us to further our dollar effectively without coming back to the equity markets. Our view right now everything that we have on our books, that we think we could start, including the acquisition we just announced, we can do without raising equity and we can maintain our net debt to EBITDA below that seven times, which we're very comfortable with. Doug Linde : You know, Steve just to add onto that. So we want to have the flexibility on our balance sheet to do things like the Santa Monica Business Park acquisition, which is a $600 plus million acquisition without having any concerns. And so what we're actually doing right now and we actually are about that one will be in the market relatively soon, because we are thinking about how we can better fund our developments and use third party capital to do that. And so when we bake these cakes and we can demonstrate you know, the strength of the cash flows from these assets, bringing in a capital partner to participate in those assets. You know, early on the project is probably something that we would consider doing and are going to consider doing on selective basis is largely to maintain the financial flexibility that we want to have so that we can do other things, without going\u2026 Steve Sakwa : And I guess to maybe - to go back to Owens point earlier about, maybe tax efficiency. I mean, it sounds like maybe selling partial or whole buildings that are older vintage, maybe not as tax efficient, is it may be better or more efficient to sell some of the newer developments where you created gains and take some of those off the table with a higher cost basis? Doug Linde : I think it's most efficient to bring a partner into a development that we haven't started yet or that we're just at the initial stages of starting because then we don't have to worry about a basis issue in terms of where we are trading and we can you know basically capture the value creation that we've done in terms of either getting promotes or getting you know \u201cstoked equity\u201d [ph] for land value that we've created and things like that that provide us with financial flexibility without having to talk of. Steve Sakwa : Got it. Okay. And then I guess just on the Boston side. I know you spent a little time talking about the roll down in New York, I guess it was pretty clear was it the GM building. Just - there was a huge uplift I guess in the Boston\u2026 Doug Linde : Yes, it was up\u2026 Steve Sakwa : And I realize they're kind of older, but can you just maybe describe that again? Doug Linde : Yeah. That was so last quarter, we mentioned that we took back space from Microsoft prior to their lease expiration. We did determination with them and their lease terminated on December 31 and we released about 100,000 square feet of 120,000 square feet of space in Cambridge to another tenant and the roll up was enormous, it was you know more than 64% because that actually was brought down by some of the other deals muffin. I think - I don't remember what I said last quarter, I think it was close to a 120% increase on that basis. Steve Sakwa : Got it. Okay, thanks. That's it from me. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey, good morning there. Just two questions from us. The first is just thinking about L.A. and the amount of time Owen you mentioned two years since the initial foray there. Right now you own the asset or you will own it outright. Your thoughts on bringing in a JV partner versus all the time and effort to find just one, you know, just the second deal, why you split that up if it's been just such a difficult market to put capital in. You guys certainly have the balance sheet and it also sounds from what you've described like there's a lot of upside in this asset. So why would you guys bring in a partner versus you know, keeping all the economics for yourself and also just leaving the fact that you work so hard just to get that second deal? Owen Thomas : Yeah. Look, Alex its great question. I think I would - it goes back to what Michael LaBelle was talking about a minute ago, which is spreading our precious equity dollars further. You know, we did not want to increase the leverage of the company. Mike described it as seven times net debt to EBITDA, so we want to be careful with our equity and we are selling some non-core assets and you know, we're certainly thinking about bringing a partner in on this particular deal and that would be a driver. Michael LaBelle : I think that you know, obviously if you bring in a JV partner thus the percentage of our NOI that comes from L.A. would not be as great as it would otherwise be, but it doesn't impact our market position. Our market position and how we operate in the market is if we own the whole thing that it enables us to really be a stronger market participant. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then the second question is going to what JPMorgan is doing, you guys have the MTA site - if recollection there were some issues here around property tax or how the - you know, the asset would be handled once it's transferred from sort of public use to private developer use. But does - what you know, Jamie is doing next door. Does that impact the timeline in your thinking for redeveloping the MTA site or the complications inherent in that make it a different timeline than you'd otherwise have if it were a straight up deal? Michael LaBelle : Yeah. No I- Alex, there's no question what JPMorgan is doing we think improves the prospects for our MTA site. We're still in the middle of an entitlement process which will take you know, a year plus to accomplish. And that's really driving our timing. But there's no question that the JPMorgan activity is helping that particular sub-market in New York. Owen Thomas : Jon, is there anything else you'd like to add to that? Jon Lange : No, I think that it. It's probably more than a year plus going through Europe and the whole process we're in. But dislike it better. Owen Thomas : Okay. Thank you, Alan. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Thank you. On Santa Monica Business Park, just given the going in yield versus the cost of that 4%, can you just walk us through how that's accretive this year, is it funded with the line and are there any one time JV fees that you're factoring in? Doug Linde : We kind of assumed that it would be funded at a kind of a weighted average cost of debt versus a you know partial mortgage debt, partial line, because we don't - we haven't determined exactly how we're going to do it. But you know, the rents in the market are - in the building are below market. So on a GAAP basis we do fair value lease accounting, so that increases the GAAP yield on this thing by bit. And in addition the ground lease we have to do capital lease accounting for that. So instead of expensing ground lease rent, we have interest expense and that modifies a little bit as well with the kind of FFO expense of that is versus what the actual ground lease expense is. So it's really those two things, in addition to the you know typical kind of FAS [ph] 13 you know, from rent bumps that are in there that are impacting the - making the gap yield be higher than the cash yield. John Kim : Okay. So accretive to FFO, but not necessarily? Doug Linde : Not initially cash, but as Owen described, a good portion of the space that is currently not income producing is contractually leased and we just haven't had those leases start yet. So the cash yield should increase fairly quickly as those tenants take occupancy of their space and they start paying rent. John Kim : Okay. And then just purely from a cash flow perspective, I know there's been different opinions on this. But it seems like it would be difficult for an acquisition with going in the yield of 3% to 3.5% going to 6% after five years to match what you're doing on your development pipeline, devolving into 7 and 7.5 with minimal risk given the lease up. What is your response to that just purely from a cash flow perspective? Doug Linde : Well, first of all this property is 94% leased. Now our developments, we do have substantial pre-leasing, but its 82%. We also have to build a building. So there's you know, construction, prophecies that have to occur and there's a timing delay, whereas we bought the Santa Monica Business Park, we have the income as soon as we closed, so that's the delta. John Kim : And just one final question on Dock 72, how much of your leasing is being impacted by WeWork, effectively competing with you for enterprise tenants? Doug Linde : I don't believe that we're \u201ccompeting\u201d with WeWork for tenants. In fact, interestingly there are some tenants who I think we see as being better suited to WeWork initially and to the extent that they're \u2013the experiment if they want to call it that of having an outpost in Brooklyn works they will - they actually be tended to. You know, we would take advantage of growing in the Park. So I think where we look at it is a very cooperative relationship. Jon, I don't if you have anything to add on that. Jon Lange : No, I think that's it. I think its cooperative. We're very excited that WeWork is undertaking its build out now and we think that occupancy probably before the end of the year the amenities will all be done. And certainly the building will show a lot better than, that it does now. It looks terrific now, but with people in it and the amenities, I think it's going to be special. John Kim : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jed Regan with Green Street Advisors. Jed Regan : Hey. Good morning, guys. Quick follow up on 3 Hudson, just order of magnitude how large would the pre-lease need to be there to kick off construction? Doug Linde : Jed, we don't want to pin ourselves down to a specific percentage. It would have to be significant. Jed Regan : Got it. And just couple of follow ups on Santa Monica Business Park. Can you give how much - what's the average remaining lease term in that project and there any big expected move outs coming up and then can you talk a little bit about snapshots [ph] occupancy in the campus? Doug Linde : I can't give you off the top of my head the average lease expiration date for the whole campus. Snap is in about 300,000 square feet and they have must take option. I think that goes to you know close to 400,000 square feet. There are - there are a couple of other larger tenants with near term expirations, meaning like 2020, 2021. And at this point, we don't assume that anyone is certainly going to walk out of the project. We think that the project is been a great home for everyone who's there. You know, we'll have to determine whether or not the rent levels that we're going to try and charge are going to be appropriate and conducive to people stay. But we're going to be aggressive about trying to maintain occupancy and maintain tenants and we are hopefully finding ways for our tenants to grow on the park. Jed Regan : Okay, great. And then, I think I heard that there's not really any significant incremental capital spend plan for that project in the near term and that you can't get at the feet position buyout before 2028 are both those accurate statements? Doug Linde : I think we are - our focus on capital in the short term is to make sure the buildings work really, really well, meaning that all of the systems and the structures of the buildings are competitive, appropriate and up to first class conditions. So my point being, we're not going to move forward with a 'revitalization, recapitalization' of the building from an aesthetic perspective in the short term. We don't know what we will do over the long-term. And there you know, the expectation is that we will purchase the fee when the fee days are - you know is contractually allowed to be purchased which is about 10 years. I am sure we will have a conversation with the owner of the land before that and find out what their motivations are and their desires are and if we can work something out before that that would be great. Jed Regan : And you're not - you're not underwriting any up-zoning potential specifically for that project? Doug Linde : We are - our perspective was that we underwrote this assuming that what you see is what you get and that we over a long, long time may be fortunate enough to find some ability to change the way the buildings are configured, the current usages, but that's going to be a discussion that we have had. We've spent literally zero time thinking about and will be much more involved with the city of Santa Monica, the constituencies you know, locally the tenants, the community, et cetera, and we would - we have no interest in getting out in front of that. Jed Regan : Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel. Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Blaine Heck : Hey, guys. Good morning. Just another one on Santa Monica, can you give us any color on the magnitude of the mark-to-market on the in-place rents at that asset? Doug Linde : I don't think we're quite ready to do that. Again, we have some initial numbers. I guess, I'd ask you to triangulate. So we told you what the initial cash return were. We told you what the returns are going to be look like in five years. Mike said it was going to be positively accretive. Michael LaBelle : And 60% of the uplift more or less is coming from rents that have been signed that are not paying yet, so. Blaine Heck : Okay. Fair enough. We can do that\u2026 Michael LaBelle : That is the five years at least. Blaine Heck : Okay. And then maybe one for Mike on the same store NOI growth, for the past several quarters, I think the straight line adjustment has been a pretty significant negative between GAAP and cash same store NOI and increased even more this quarter. Can you just comment on whether we should expect that to unwind at some point as we see free rent burn off or is there something else going on there? Michael LaBelle : I don't think there's anything unusual going on, you are saying the same store is - the spread between cash and GAAP is increasing? Blaine Heck : Yeah, it seems that it has been a bigger negative to the cash number as we looked at it this quarter. So it seems like there's - there might be some pre run in there that, I am not sure\u2026 Michael LaBelle : I mean, I would say of our non-cash rents we have about $20 million that is kind of fair value rent and basically the rest of it is free rent that will burn off over the next year or two. Blaine Heck : Are there I guess, are there any large leases in there that might have been driving that free rent number up that you know in that, that's going to burn off and we're going to see a bit of a boost to the cash same store number? Michael LaBelle : Well, I think yeah, I mean, there's the leasing that we did at 100 Fed [ph] is not cash paying yet, that was over 200,000 square feet of space. The stuff that we're doing at 200 Clarendon, many of those leases are in free rent periods. You know, that's leasing that we've done in the last 12 months. That is just kind of getting into our numbers now and in this year and so its free rent associated with that. And then in Cambridge some of the leases that we had, like the one that Doug described and I described is in a free rent period in 2018 and we did some blending extends in San Francisco and also in Cambridge that we have to wait until the natural lease expiration in '19 and '20 for those things to you know, turn into cash. So those are some examples. Blaine Heck : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. Operator : And this concludes the question and answer portion. I would now like to turn the call back over to the speakers for closing remarks. Owen Thomas : That concludes all our remarks. Thank you for all your time and attention. Operator : This concludes today's Boston Properties conference call. Thank you again for attending and have a good day.",

And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks. Owen Thomas : Thank you, Sara, and welcome to Boston Properties. Sara joined us last week as Vice President and Head of Investor Relations and comes with a wealth of experience in the field. We are delighted that you are here. Good morning, everyone. Second quarter marked another strong period of wins in leasing and new investments, and we continue to complete major steps towards achieving our growth goals. In this last quarter, we generated FFO per share which is $0.04 above our guidance, $0.02 above street consensus and increased the midpoint of our full-year 2018 FFO guidance by $0.07. We leased 1.7 million square feet, which is well above our long-term quarterly average for the period. This brings us to almost 4 million square feet leased in the first half of the year, and we achieved several important leasing wins on key in-service assets, which Doug will review. And just this past July, we secured Verizon as anchor tenant to develop a 627,000 square-foot office tower in Boston as the last phase of our Hub on Causeway project with Delaware North. We closed the acquisition of Santa Monica Business Park in West LA with CPPIB as a capital partner, and we closed a joint venture with the Moinian Group for the future development of 3 Hudson Boulevard, a large-scale office property in the Hudson Yards. So, overall, Q2 was a strong quarter for Boston Properties with activity in leasing, development and acquisitions continuing in July. We continue to experience a positive environment for commercial real estate, including high-quality office assets in gateway cities which is our focus with several economic and market tailwinds. First, overall economic conditions continue to be quite favorable and have if anything improved since last quarter. Though impacted by timing of new trade tariffs, second quarter U.S. GDP growth was 4.1% and is projected to be 2.8% for all of 2018. Job creation remains steady with 630,000 jobs created in the second quarter and the unemployment rate stable at 4%. Though the prospects of trade wars and political turmoil is unsettling and economic downturn does not seem imminent to us. On capital markets, though the Fed increased rates 25 basis points in June and is signaling additional increases in 2018, the 10-year treasury rate actually as of morning is trading roughly flat to the level that it traded on our last earnings call. Obviously, the yield curve is flattening, given low inflation in global market forces. We don\u2019t see significant long-term interest rate increases as a major risk factor to our business at this time. Given this economic backdrop and the fact that the supply and demand of office space remain in general equilibrium, leasing activity is healthy across most of our geographic markets and with customers in numerous industries. In the private real estate market, transaction volume growth has turned positive. Specifically, U.S. large asset transaction volume in the second quarter increased 9% from the first quarter and 15% over the second quarter of \u201817. Office represented 31% of the transaction volume for the quarter and increased 4% from the first quarter of 2018. Investor appetite and as a result cap rates remain healthy in our core markets. There were once again, numerous significant asset transactions this quarter with cap rates in the 4s and prices per square-foot above replacement cost. Starting in Boston, Pier 4 in the Seaport is selling for a low 4s cap rate and just under $1,200 a foot to a domestic pension advisor. This building is 370,000 square feet and 93% leased. In New York, a 20% interest in 10 Hudson Yards sold to a domestic pension fund at a 4% cap rate and just over $1,200 a foot. The building is new, comprises 1,000,008 [ph] square feet and fully leased. In San Francisco 345 Brannan in the SoMa district is under agreement to sell for a San Francisco record price of $1,326 a square-foot and a 5 cap rate to a REIT. Property is 110,000 feet and is  100% leased to Dropbox. And finally, in Washington DC, 2099 Pennsylvania Avenue located across the street from our future development at 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue is under agreement to sell for $1,054 a square-foot and a 4% cap rate to a domestic pension advisor. This building is a little over 2,000 feet and is 98% leased. Moving to Boston Properties capital activities, we\u2019re having an active year selling non-core assets and will likely exceed our $300 million disposition target this year. We recently closed the sale of 91 Hartwell Avenue in Lexington, Mass for $22 million. With this sale, we\u2019ve completed nearly $150 million in dispositions year-to-date. We are marketing for sale of 1333 New Hampshire Avenue located near Dupont Circle in Washington DC. This 320,000 square-foot property will be fully vacated by Akin Gump in 2019. We are executing many new developments in DC and the lighter renovation of this asset justified by market conditions is not a good fit with our ongoing strategy. We are considering recapitalization options for our 634,000 square-foot build-to-suit to for the TSA in Springfield, Virginia, in order to free-up capital for our growing development pipeline. If completed, we will refund our invested capital to date, avoid future development draws and generate development fees as well as a return on our invested capital. And we continue to explore additional sales of select non-core assets throughout the portfolio. Moving to acquisitions. Last week, we announced the closing of our Santa Monica Business Park acquisition in LA. We did enter into a joint venture with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board who will own 45% of the project and the venture completed $300 million of acquisitions financing. Boston Properties resultant equity investment in the property is approximately $180 million. On returns, our initial unleveraged cash yield is nearly 4% and is expected to be over 6% in five years due to market roll-ups and must take space from Snap, a major tenant. Most of the property is encumbered by ground lease with an above market coupon and a market purchase option in 10 years. The coupon on the ground rent is above the stabilized cash yield of the asset. So, the future purchase of the land will be accretive to annual returns. We are excited and honored to form this first partnership with CPPIB, which both of us hope and expect will lead to future joint investments. We\u2019re also very pleased with our increased presence in the Los Angeles market, which doubled with this deal and our critical mass in Santa Monica. Development continues to be our primary strategy for creating value. We remain very active, pursuing both new pre-lease projects and sites for future projects. Specifically, we announced last week, the Boston Properties has entered into a partnership with the Moinian Group to purchase a 25% stake in 3 Hudson Boulevard, one of the most attractive, large tenant sites in New York City. The site supports a 2 million square-foot office building and is located adjacent to the nearly completed 7 train entrance. Boston Properties will assume operational control of the co-development, and construction and the foundation for the tower is already underway. We were able to acquire the site at an attractive price and minimize our capital outlay. We invested $46 million at closing and have a commitment to fund an additional $62 million in the future capital if capital is needed by the venture. We believe the purchase price for the land approximates $360 per FAR square-foot and significantly less on a rentable square-foot basis. When you factor in the initial FAR purchase, option prices for the remaining FAR and funding today on the foundations and below grade base building components. We also provided $80 million of financing to replace an existing land loan. Our focus now is securing a significant anchor tenant, which is a precondition of commencing vertical construction. With the closing of -- with the 3 Hudson Boulevard joint venture and our previously described development at 343 Madison Avenue, we now have two major sites in New York for future growth. Continuing the theme of conserving our public equity capital, we are also working toward bringing in a capital partner for the project at 343 Madison Avenue, currently in the pre-development phase. In Boston, we announced yesterday that we executed a lease agreement with Verizon Communications for approximately 440,000 square feet to anchor a 100 Causeway, a 627,000 square-foot 31-storey office tower. This is the last phase of the Hub on Causeway, our 1.4 million square-foot multi-phase development located adjacent to North Station and the TD Garden. The first two phases of the project are underway and include a hotel and residential tower on top of the mixed-use podium. We are developing the site as part of the 50-50 joint venture with Delaware North. A 100 Causeway is 70% preleased and we are in tenant discussions to lease the balance of the building. Our future invested capital is estimated to be $260 million and projected initial cash yields are consistent with our development hurdles, approaching 7%. Also in Boston, we\u2019re in discussions with an existing tenant at Kendall Center to redevelop an office property for their expansion. And lastly, this quarter, in Reston, we delivered into service our 508-unit Signature residential project which is in the early phases of lease-up. Our current development and redevelopment pipeline stands at 13 office and residential projects comprising 6 million square feet and $3.3 billion of investment for our share. Most of the pipeline is well underway and we have $1.1 billion remaining to fund. The commercial component of this portfolio is 83% preleased and aggregate projected cash yields approximate 7%. These figures exclude the $1.4 billion in new developments we have described in this and previous calls where we have anchor lease commitments, but have not commenced the project including 2,100 Pennsylvania Avenue Reston Gateway and 100 Causeway. These projects will all commence in 2018 and 2019. Our capital strategy remains unchanged. Our best use of capital today is launching new preleased development and making select value-add acquisitions for which the yields are higher than both stabilized property acquisitions, and the inferred cap rate and repurchasing our shares, notwithstanding their material discount to NAV. Our best and cheapest source of capital is debt financing, which we can utilize without materially changing our credit profile due to the new debt capacity provided by the income from our development deliveries. We have and will continue to select non-core assets, which raises marginal capital. The sale of larger core assets is a less efficient funding source, given significant embedded tax gains and resulting special dividend requirements. We can accomplish our growth plan without accessing public equity capital, given the debt capacity and delivered developments, and if needed, access the plentiful private equity capital. This has been another significant quarter of wins for Boston Properties, both in the new investments I described and in leasing, which Doug is about to discuss. Our outlook and future growth plan continue to be strong and viable. We remain confident with our plan to materially increase our NOI starting in 2019 through development deliveries and leasing up our existing assets from approximately 90% to 93%. And continuing growth in 2020 and 2021 is now becoming more clear and likely, given all the new developments we\u2019ve added an expect to add to our pipeline. Let me turn it over to Doug. Doug Linde : Thank you, Owen. Good morning, everybody. Last quarter, I began my comments by saying that we were as busy as we\u2019ve ever been. We are actually busier today. Owen\u2019s comments focused on a string of additional investments that we have moved from pursuit into the active pipeline. We\u2019ve been communicating these opportunities for a number of quarters. And in the case of 100 Causeway Street, which will be an immediate development start, once again, we found another anchor customer that matches with our fundamental strategy of creating great places where tenants can best attract and retain talent. You can\u2019t lose track of the labor availability, employment picture in our market. The unemployment rate for people with a degree from a college, BS or BA is about 2% across the board. Finding an engaged, high-quality workforce is a critical issue for our tenants, and we believe our new and rejuvenated portfolio is a huge advantage. This is our value proposition. Last October, we had our investor conference in Boston and we described our development activities, the major capital refreshment that was underway, our vacancy and our leasing exposure in \u201818 and \u201819. The conclusion was that the portfolio was in a really good shape, with the exception of 159 East 53rd St. and 399 Park Avenue where we had a lot a row to hoe. Those two assets with the combined availability of over 700,000 square feet have the potential to contribute $55 million of annualized first year revenue. Remember, we only own 55% of 159 East 53rd. We explicitly stated that it was the most important operational challenge we had in front of us in \u201818. And I\u2019m pleased to report that we\u2019ve made a lot of progress. We had 480,000 square feet of availability last October at 399 Park Avenue. If you picture our stacking plan moving from the top to the bottom, floors 39 and 38 have been leased 50,000 square feet; floors 26 and 25 have been leased 50,000 square feet. We are negotiating a lease for floors 18, 19, 20, 70,000 square feet. The 14th floor has been leased 40,000 square feet. And we recently signed an LOI and are negotiating a lease for 7, 8, 9 and 10, 250,000 square feet. If my math is correct, that totals 460,000 square feet of leases, 140,000 square feet which are signed. We have two tenants that are competing for the last first floor available, the 21st floor about 23,000 square feet. And just to top up this activity, this week, we expect to sign a 30-year lease commitment for the entirety of the office space at 159 East 53rd St., a 195,326 square feet. In total, those signed leases and leases in negotiation represent just over $55 million of revenue. The timing of the revenue recognition of the leases is consistent with our previous expectations and significantly weighted to the fourth quarter of 2019. We can control when the leases get signed. We can\u2019t control when the tenants build out their space. In the second quarter, we completed 420,000 square feet of leasing in our Midtown portfolio that included 300,000 square-foot of expansions and extensions at 601 Lex and 599 Lex, and it included 75,000 square feet of what I describe as 399. Overall activity in the Midtown market continues to be strong and the brokers we work with confirm that the activity we are seeing is consistent with the overall market. The result has been a change in mood and affirming of lease economics. The leasing activity continues to be led by the buyer sector which continues to enjoy the advantages of that Midtown Manhattan offers. Base building construction at Dock 72 is winding down and we are building out the amenity space offerings. WeWork has commenced construction of its tenant work with an expected completion by early 2019. We have a few ongoing dialogues, which is a slight improvement from last quarter. For Brooklyn, large tenant activity has been light and tenants have a more of a just-in-time perspective. So, we don\u2019t expect much leasing until the amenity spaces are closer to completed at the end of this year. Market fundamentals continue to improve in San Francisco. There is no new product for lease in 2018, 2019, 2020 or 2021, now that a single user has leased the entire 755,000 square-foot of Park Tower. The next new product to deliver will be a first admission in 2022 or beyond, and 270,000 square-foot rehab expansion that just commenced at 633 Fulton. The large blocks of contiguous available sublet space stemming from tenants that are moving to new construction are disappearing. The Dropbox sublet space, 300,000-plus square-foot has been leased and we believe the Salesforce sublet at Rincon Center and 405 Howard which are about 200,000 square feet each are also committed. As we move into the back half of \u201818 and \u201819 our CBD activities in Embarcadero Center where we\u2019ve commenced our major refresh of the public areas and amenities.  This quarter, we completed 109,000 square feet of office leasing in DC, including 60,000 square feet of the space made available from bank consultants move to Salesforce Tower. We have four noncontiguous full floors at EC4 and may have the opportunity for the 60,000 square-foot 3-foot block at the top of EC4 together next year. Full floor financial or business service demand isn\u2019t as robust as the tech-led growth, but it is feeling the pressure from the lack of availability, which should lead to very favorable pricing. There has been a reduction in inventory of traditional space as landlords, including Boston Properties speculatively build more creative office in existing traditional building. There have been significant increases in rents for large block availability geared toward a tech tenant since they\u2019ve been based on new construction economics. Rent growth in older towers which are traditional build-outs are also higher but at rates that are still lower than a new construction inventory. It\u2019s a great value. The Silicon Valley has also seen a pickup in activity. There have been over 4 million square feet of deals in the first half of the year from leases in excess of 100,000 square feet, the majority of which has been growth. The existing Class A inventory is being absorbed. The latest megadeal being 1 million square-foot, at Moffett Tower in Sunnyvale for buildings that will be delivered in 2019. We did another 80,000 square feet of leasing this quarter at our single-storey product in Mountain View where the average rents increased more than 100% and starting rents are in the mid-50s, triple net. We are also responding to a multi-building build-to-suit opportunity at the station on North First. While we didn\u2019t sign another development deal build-to-suit in DC this quarter, we did complete 650,000 square feet of leasing. The activity is concentrated in Reston where we signed 435,000 square feet and we continue to see strong, growing demand from our incumbent tenants. Today, we have 500,000 square feet of additional leases in negotiation. In the second quarter, we completed a 235,000 square-foot renewal at Democracy Tower, which included a tenant recapturing 76,000 square feet of previously sublet base. We had a cyber security company signed a 50,000 square-foot lease including 15,000 square feet of expansion and an internet analytics company renewed on 84,000 square feet. We\u2019re working on new leases and renewals with software and web services companies as well as defense contractors and engineering firms. Owen mentioned our second residential project in Reston, which came on line this quarter. We\u2019ve leased about 178 of the 508 units, while at the same time improving the year-over-year occupancy of the 359-unit Avant project right around the corner, which ended the quarter at 95% occupancy with a 1.5% increase in year-to-year rents in the face of trying to lease 508 other units. In the district, we completed an expansion and an extension with WeWork at Met Square, our 20%-80% JV with Blackstone. Our other CBD activity was limited in the portfolio. It continues to be a very competitive Class A market and we actually expect the potential buyer of 1333 New Hampshire to renovate and operate the building at a more moderately price position. This is not an area of the market in which we at Boston Properties concentrate, hence the decision to exit the asset. 1333 New Hampshire, you\u2019ll remember, was the one asset that we identified at our investor conference that we were considering for a gut renovation at major project where the only remaining component of the building was going to be its structure. This is obviously a change in plan. Owen described our expansion into the Santa Monica Business Park. The last few quarters, the corporate M&A deals surrounding HBO, Disney, Fox, Comcast, Hulu changes in ownership have really been weighing on deal activities. Nonetheless, there has been and continues to be large block activity. The shared office companies have been very active. We\u2019re tracking over 0.5 million square feet of transactions that are either completed or underway at six individual assets on the West Side. At Colorado Center, we completed 130,000 square feet extension with one of our tenants during the quarter. And last week, we leased the remaining large block of space at Colorado Center 58,000 square feet at Bird, the scooter company or the -- I guess what they call them to the motorized scooter company, which brings our occupancy there to 98%. The tightest market in our portfolio continues to be Boston. The percentage leased in our Boston regional office assets is the strongest at 95% in total. We do not have a single vacant floor in our Boston CBD portfolio. When we started the quarter, we had one floor left at 888 Boylston. We signed one lease, expect the second to be executed this week, which will leave us with a whopping 3,300 square feet in the building. You\u2019ll note that our leasing percentage is now 88% at the Hub on Causeway and next quarter you\u2019ll see that 100 Causeway is included in our statistics at 70% leased. Our largest negotiation in the region right now involves this piece of place that\u2019s expiring in 2022. Demand for space in Boston from growing technology tenants is a strong as we have ever seen. This quarter, the Back Bay had major absorption with a 400,000 square-foot expansion by Wayfair and 100,000 square-foot lease with DraftKings. In addition, Amazon is expanding by taking a 430,000 square-foot building in the Seaport, little less than the 440,000 square-foot building that Bryan is building over at The Hub. In Cambridge, where we have limited availability, our activity is centered at the Proto apartment building. We opened up the Proto 45 days ago in Cambridge. We\u2019ve leased 82 out of 244 market rate units and 8 of 36 affordable units. Even as many tenants are attracted to the center cities of Boston and Cambridge, there continues to be significant demand in our Waltham, Lexington suburban. We signed the lease for the entire availability at Reservoir North, 73,000 square feet with a tenant that is upgrading out of a 30,000 square-foot B building owned by a local developer and we are in negotiations with two tenants for 70,000 square feet of the remaining 100,000 at 20 CityPoint. Our active construction projects, including the recent delivery of the Signature, total about $3.5 billion. We\u2019ve signed construction contracts at fixed cost for all of those projects. With the 100 Causeway Street announcement, we have another $1.4 billion of development that is in design and will be bid in the next 12 months. Changes in tariff rates and other headwinds in the construction industry are things we are mindful of when we give our budget and agree to future fixed leases for these new projects. All of our budgets include, both contingencies and cost escalation estimates to manage these types of events. While we have seen an impact on certain components of our projects, our allowances are sized to manage these risks and they are all component of the total investing estimates that we provided in our disclosure in our supplemental package that we haven\u2019t covered. I\u2019m going to conclude my remarks with some comments about the same-store statistics for the quarter. Boston and San Francisco had very strong rollup, 44% and 35% net respectively across their portfolios on about 335,000 square feet. New York City is down on a very small pool, mostly from leases at 599 Lex. And Washington DC is down from the 230,000 square-foot renewal we did at Democracy Tower in Reston where the initial market rents are usurped by the effect of the 3% annual rent bumps in operating expense escalations that are embedded in the prior 10-year lease. On an earnings basis, the rent is about the same. I\u2019ll stop there and turn it over to Mike. Mike LaBelle : Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. With all the transactions we completed this quarter, Owen and Doug had a lot of ground to cover. I\u2019m going to try to describe the financial impact and talk about the quarter. So, we had a solid second quarter as we exceeded our earnings guidance and we are raising our full-year 2018 estimates. Our second quarter funds from operations came in at a $1.58 per share that\u2019s $0.04 per share above the midpoint and $0.02 per share above the high-end of our prior guidance range. Our portfolio exceeded our estimate by $4 million, about $0.02 per share and it was primarily related to lower operating expenses for the quarter. The majority of these expenses were repair and maintenance items that now will be incurred later this year and will not represent savings to the full-year. Our development fee income also exceeded our budget for the quarter by about a penny or $1.5 million. The majority of the increase is from earning leasing commissions from our joint venture portfolio that included deals closed at Colorado Center, Metropolitan Square and the Hub on Causeway. And lastly, our interest expense was slightly lower than our assumption due to higher capitalized interest on our development pipeline and major capital projects. As you can see in our supplemental report, our second quarter same-property NOI was down 3.3% on a cash basis compared to the second quarter of 2017. This performance was as we expected and it was in line with our prior same-property guidance and it\u2019s primarily due to the move-outs at 399 Park Avenue in the third quarter of 2017 that we have discussed. We project our cash same-property results will improve in the back half of the year as the income from this space is fully out of the prior year period. And as Doug described, we are well on our way to re-leasing the space. As we look at the rest of 2018, we are seeing solid leasing activity in the portfolio, which we expect to result in higher top-line revenues than our prior projection. This includes several renewals in Embarcadero Center and our Mountain View portfolio with increases in rents that will start to flow through our numbers this year. In New York City, we signed a two-floor expansion at 601 Lexington Avenue for space that expires in the fourth quarter that we had expected to be vacant. In Reston Town Center, Doug described the renewal and expansion activity we\u2019ve achieved. And in Santa Monica, we\u2019ve had similar success, completing 130,000 square-foot, early renewal with large rent increase and leasing an incremental 60,000 square feet which is nearly all of our vacancy at Colorado Center. These deals will start to hit our revenues later this year and primarily impact our straight line rents due to pre-rent periods and being early renewals where the cash rent increase comes at naturally expiration. We\u2019ve increased our assumptions for straight line rents in 2018. However, we\u2019ve not changed our assumptions for 2018 same-property NOI growth as we expect we will still end up within the current ranges. So, despite giving back most of our second quarter outperformance from deferring operating expenses into the second half of the year, we anticipate our full-year portfolio NOI will be a penny per share higher than our previous assumptions from higher revenues. In our non-same-property portfolio, we closed on the $627 million acquisition of Santa Monica Business Park in July. As Owen described, we completed our capital structure by bringing in CPP as a 45% partner and closing $300 million of mortgage financing at a fixed rate of just over 4%. A portion of the property is subject to a ground lease which we have accounted for as a capital lease due to our right to purchase the land in 10 years. The net contribution to our 2018 FFO is approximately $0.02 per share, including the impact of the ground lease expense and the mortgage interest expense. We also closed on the sale of 91 Hartwell Avenue, a fully leased suburban office building located in Lexington, Massachusetts. The lost income from selling 91 Hartwell costs us about $1 million of NOI in 2018. We have increased our assumptions for development and management services income in 2018 by $6 million to a new range of $37 million to $42 million for the year. In addition to exceeding our second quarter budget, we have two additional one-time, leasing commissions we expect to book later this year. And we also start recognizing fee income from Santa Monica Business Park in the second half of the year. As part of our investment in 3 Hudson Boulevard, we originated an $80 million loan to refinance an existing land loan secured by the site. This is an opportunistic low leverage secured loan that will generate interest income at a positive spread to our corporate debt cost and reduce our overall carrying cost in the investment. We have modified our 2018 net interest assumptions, partially to account for the interest income for the loan. Our new range for 2018, net interest expense is $363 million to $375 million, representing a reduction of $3.5 million at the midpoint. So, for the full-year 2018, we are raising our guidance range for funds from operation to $6.36 to $6.41 per share, an increase of $0.07 per share at the midpoint. The increase in our guidance is from $0.03 per share of higher projected portfolio NOI which includes Santa Monica Business Park, $0.03 per share of higher fee income and $0.02 per share from lower net interest expense offset by the loss of a $0.01 per share from the sale of 91 Hartwell Avenue.  Our guidance does not assume any additional acquisitions or dispositions. We are in the market to sell 1333 New Hampshire in Washington DECLINED, and if we\u2019re successful, we will likely close later this year. The property currently contributes approximately $10 million to our annual FFO. So, if we were to close on the sale at the end of the third quarter 2018, it will reduce FFO by less than $0.02 per share and 2019 FFO by about $0.06 per share. Looking out to 2019, we anticipate strong FFO growth with a sizable component of our development pipeline delivering during the year. We still anticipate that all of the revenue from the leasing at Salesforce Tower will be commenced by the end of the third quarter of 2019. Both 145 Broadway in Cambridge and the Hub on Causeway podium development will deliver in the back half of 2019, and we project incremental growth from the lease-up of our two residential developments that delivered this year. Doug described in detail the activity on the leasing front in the portfolio with a significant driver of growth over the next two years being the lease-up of 399 Park Avenue where we currently have 480,000 square feet of high-value vacancy. We have signed leases or letters of intent on nearly all of this space. As a reminder, the majority of the income will not commence until later in 2019 as the space becomes occupied. However, we\u2019ve made great progress in achieving our goal of having all of this space leased in 2018. The projected growth in our property NOI will be partially offset by higher interest expense in 2019. The capitalized interest for our developments delivering will drop off. And although we continue to add new projects to the pipeline, they will be funded primarily with incremental debt which will offset the capitalized interest related to the development funding. In addition, a 100% of the capitalized interest associated with Salesforce Tower will stop at the end of 2018, even though revenues from the project will not stabilize until third quarter 2019. We will also have interest expense for our new investments including Santa Monica Business Park, 3 Hudson Yards, and the anticipated acquisition of Hines 5% interest in Salesforce Tower. We have started discussions with Hines and expect to close sometime in late 2018 or early 2019. So, while we will not be giving detailed 2019 guidance until next quarter, we want to stress that we\u2019re delivering on all of the growth opportunities that we have been describing over the past year. And we remain confident in our plan to materially increase our NOI, starting in 2019. That completes what we wanted to cover formally. Operator, if you could open up the line for questions that will be great. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi. Manny Korchman : Hey. Good morning, everyone. I wondered, Doug, you discussed two sort of potential big projects in New York, one on Madison and the other in Hudson Yards, both of which required big preleasing before you go vertical. Can you tell us about the discussions with tenants on both those projects, maybe the type of tenants and their desire to be at one or the other and how those projects will differ? Owen Thomas : Yes. Manny, good morning. It\u2019s Owen. So, first of all, the projects are on a very different time schedule. So, the 3 Hudson Boulevard is entitled and ready to go. We\u2019re actually working on the foundation to try to improve our speed to market. 343 Madison is in the entitlement process and will not be ready for any kind of new development or tenant conversations for some time. So, I think that\u2019s the first point. And the second point is, we are in the market with 3 Hudson Boulevard. We are -- as I mentioned in my remarks, we certainly are seeking a very significant tenant to launch the project. We have JLL engaged that\u2019s working on our behalf to help us with this. And we are engaged -- we have been engaged and are engaging in those dialogues. John, is there anything more you would like to say about that? John Powers who is one phone. John? We didn\u2019t hear you. John Powers : Sorry. So, the MTA site is in the future, as you said, that has to go through the unit [ph] process. And we have some issues between the city and the state regarding the taxes that have to get sorted out first. So, as you said, that\u2019s very much in the future. And we just signed up 3 Hudson Boulevard, and we are very excited with JLL and we\u2019re starting to meet with people now. Manny Korchman : Great. And then, switching to the West Coast, I think it\u2019s new to us that you\u2019re buying out -- the Hines, Salesforce Tower. Can you tell us is there a contractual deal there or why you sort of try to buy that small stake in the building? Mike LaBelle : Sure. So, when we set the deal up originally, we gave Hines, the ability to effectively sell their interest upon stabilization. And they\u2019ve indicated that that\u2019s something that they would like us to consider doing. And so, we are entering into a thoughtful dialogue with them about what the value of their interest is, and they haven\u2019t promoted position based upon performance of the property. And we will come to some sort of a successful conclusion hopefully in the next couple of months. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Craig Mailman : Just curious on 3 Hudson. You gave the comp at 10 Hudson. I\u2019m just curious where you think your all-in costs and development return comes in 3 Hudson relative to kind of the stabilized value at 10 Hudson? Owen Thomas : Okay. I don\u2019t know a thing about what the stabilized value is for 10 Hudson other than what the purchase price was. So, it\u2019s hard to comment on that. We believe\u2026 Craig Mailman : Forecast... Owen Thomas : So, we believe that at the appropriate time with the appropriate tenant, we are going to be able to generate a return somewhere near what we\u2019ve been executing on all of our other developments. The amount of space that we have to lease and the amount of speculative risk that we have to take will be obviously a key determinant in what goes on there. And we are in a position where we are -- we believe it will cost somewhere between $1,300 and $1,400 a square-foot to build that building based upon the sort of market comps for our cost for construction, for TIs, for interest carry. When we start the building and what the escalation of those costs are going to be will obviously impact those numbers. Where rents will be will impact those numbers. So, we\u2019re not in a position today to say the cost is going to be x dollars per square foot and the return is going to be x percent because there are too many unknowns from a timing perspective. Craig Mailman : And given how far along you guys are on the foundation, what do you think, if you guys were to get a significant prelease kind of the delivery time would be from here? Owen Thomas : So, the schedule that we have right now on is somewhere between 36 and 40 months from the construction go date, once the foundation has completed to having a tenant physically in the building. Craig Mailman : And then, just last one for me. Just curious your updated thoughts here on WeWork and exposure to kind of coworking in general as this tenant in particular kind of branches out into other areas of the real estate spectrum. Does that at all change your view on more exposure to this tenant or kind of how do you look at them as a tenant versus competitor at this point? Owen Thomas : WeWork is an important customer of Boston Properties. In the supplemental, you\u2019ll see they\u2019re 14th on the sheet now in terms of their size, they\u2019re about 0.9% of income. And we are selectively talking to them about additional stores that they would put in our buildings. As Doug described, we\u2019re getting pretty full. So, there are less of those opportunities today. But, we -- for the right building and for the right situation, we would certainly consider expanding our relationship with WeWork. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel. John Guinee : Owen, nice quarter. You mentioned twice conserving public equity capital. Does that mean that you would not issue equity at any price because it just increases denominator too much and makes it too difficult to move the needle or that there is a price that you would rather issue commons and do -- use JV equity? Owen Thomas : John, given where the stock price is trading, which is we think a very material discount to the value of the underlying assets and at a rough breakeven yield in the low-5, we don\u2019t think that\u2019s an attractive market to raise capital at this juncture. And much better way to do it -- the best way to do it right now for us is debt financing because we are creating debt capacity with all the developments that we\u2019re delivering, and that the cost of the debt is much -- certainly much lower than issuing public equity. Now, I think the other point I would make is if we get pushed in terms -- we don\u2019t want to increase the leverage of the company and if we require more capital, we would certainly continue to access the private equity market for real estate. We just demonstrated with the Santa Monica deal that we have great access to that and have another great capital partner in one of our buildings. So, that\u2019s the way we\u2019re thinking about it. Public equity is at the bottom of our list in terms of where we want to go raise capital. John Guinee : Great, okay. And then, Mike LaBelle, your midpoint for 3Q is about a $1.62, your implied midpoint for 4Q is about a $1.70. Can you talk about how you get from $1.62 to $1.70? And then second. Is $1.70 a good floor when I think about quarter by quarter for 2019. Mike LaBelle : One thing to think about is there is some one-time leasing commissions, one time kind development fees that are in the back half of this year. So, I\u2019m not sure that we\u2019re going to be able to have the same level of kind of development fee income and leasing commissions next year. So, that\u2019s something that may not recur. With regard to kind of our -- as we move through, our development will continue to kind of add incremental every quarter. So, we\u2019re gaining occupancy at Salesforce Tower every quarter and it\u2019s going to move in, occupy their space, and then suddenly we can recognize revenue. Even though we\u2019ve -- in many of these cases, we\u2019ve been getting cash from these tenants for months and months and months, we can\u2019t recognize the revenue until they finish their space. And then, obviously, we have the two residential properties that are coming in as well. The other kind of difference between the third and the fourth quarter is the summer months have higher expenses where we operate, so utilities in particular are higher. And so, in the fourth quarter, you will see some benefit from that in the fourth quarter. John Guinee : And then, last question, if I may. You said something very interesting, Owen. You said, your land at 2 Hudson -- or 3 Hudson was $360 per FAR, but significantly less on a net rentable square foot basis. Can you give a quick tutorial on the difference between FAR and net rentable square foot for a building like that? Owen Thomas : John, it\u2019s related to the ratio between the rentable square foot -- square feet and the usable square feet and how the ultimate configuration of the building is. And the latter part of that is yet to be determined. But, the price per rentable square foot is lower than $360. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Alexander Goldfarb : Just two questions. First, Mike LaBelle, as we look to 2019, I just want to get clarification on two items. One, it sounded like the sale -- well, you guys have discussed it before and now it sounds like the sale of 1333 New Hampshire is something new that we want to incorporate into our models for next year? And then, second is, based on all the leasing that Doug described at 399 and 159, and the fact that you guys I think expect this all to really hit in the fourth quarter of next year. Is that consistent with what you guys have previously laid out at the Investor Day and earlier in the year at NAREIT or has some of that timing from revenue recognition been pushed back? Mike LaBelle : The timing with regard to the New York City leasing is in line with what we have expected and what we\u2019ve kind of talked about before. We feel like we are meeting exactly what our plan is with regard to the deals that we\u2019re working on and when those deals will come into the revenue picture. I mean, the vast majority of the space has been demolished. So, it has to be rebuilt. And these tenants will take anywhere between 9 and 12 months to kind of get into that space. And some of these tenants obviously have a lease expiry. So, they may not be in a tremendous rush. So, they signed a lease in the third quarter of 2018, but their lease expiration is until the end of 2019. They may be able to build out that space. But they may move fairly slowly, because they really don\u2019t need to be in that space until closer to their lease expiration. So, we are right in line with what our expectations have been on that. And then, with -- and also with the development pipeline by the way. We\u2019ve provided guidance as to kind of what the development pipeline is going to be delivering in the next couple of years. And we are in line with our expectations in terms of delivering those spaces and getting that rent started. So, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s really any change to that. On 1333, we\u2019ve talked about it before that we would consider selling it. It\u2019s now on the market and we\u2019re talking to potential buyers. So, I would say, it\u2019s much more likely that we will be successful in selling that asset than it would have been last quarter. So, that is a change. We have not included in our guidance yet because we just don\u2019t do it until it\u2019s done. But that\u2019s why I wanted to point out because I do think it\u2019s more likely than not that that\u2019s going to happen. Alexander Goldfarb : And then, the second question is for Ray Ritchey. Ray, just speaking to some brokers down in DC recently, mentioned about a pending uptick in government leasing, whether it\u2019s possibly something with the FBI but just sort of some pent-up demand from government for leasing. So, could you just comment on what you\u2019re hearing and seeing in the DC market, just given that it\u2019s been a tough -- it\u2019s been a great development market but a tough landlords market? Ray Ritchey : Yes. Thanks, Alex. I think, the FBI is still very much in question about whether they go forward or not. Our President has made it one of his personal agendas. And given everything else he faces, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s like number one on his target [ph] to get started. In terms of GSA leasing in general, when you have something along the lines of 26 million square feet of lease expirations the next three to four years, something\u2019s got to be done. However, it is still priced at a point that makes new development very, very challenging. So, we tend to see I think a lot of renewals, a lot of short-term extensions to keep the government in place with no major moves, I think on the GSA side, but certainly not the downturn we\u2019ve seen in past cycles. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Blaine Heck : Doug, great to hear about all the activity at 399 and 159. So, can you just frame out about how much of that $55 million incremental NOI is under contract versus under negotiation or LOI? And maybe handicap the possibility of any of those leases that are outside walking away at this point? Owen Thomas : So, there is 700,000 square feet, 140,000 of it is signed. I expect that there is another 200,000 that will get signed before Friday. So, that will get to that 340,000 square feet or just about half of it. And the other two major leases are actively being negotiated. And I think our expectation is they are going to get done. Blaine Heck : Mike, same-store NOI guidance implies around 5% in the back half of the year, assuming there\u2019s not a lot of noise in the same-store pool. So, can you just talk about how we should think about that sequentially? Is it going to ramp up through the end of the year or kind of jump in the third quarter and stay elevated? Mike LaBelle : I think, it\u2019s going to move up but it\u2019s mostly going to be in the fourth quarter. The 399 space was not all out of the portfolio until midway through the third quarter, I guess last year. So that\u2019s still going to be in there for a part of next quarter. So, I think that it will be better than it was this quarter, and then the fourth quarter will be even better than that to achieve within the range that we provided in our supplemental. Blaine Heck : And then, last one for me. On 3 Hudson, just coming back to that one. Can you guys just give any specifics or a range around the preleasing hurdle you guys might have there, given the supply picture on the West Side? And maybe a little more color on how you guys are viewing demand for additional new construction in Manhattan at this point in the cycle? Doug Linde : Let me try to answer this. Owen\u2019s tried [ph] and maybe you didn\u2019t find it satisfactory. So, I\u2019ll try a different tact, which it\u2019s all going to depend on who the tenant is, how long the lease is, what they are doing in the building, where they are in the building and how much they are paying. So, there is no number. I can\u2019t -- we can\u2019t tell you that if a 650,000 square-foot tenant showed up, we would do the deal; and I can\u2019t tell you if a 1 million square-foot tenant show, we wouldn\u2019t do the deal. So, we\u2019re not in a position because we just don\u2019t know the facts around leases. But, it\u2019s going to be a big number. And we are -- I think Owen has described in previous quarters that as we move on in the cycle, we have toned down our risk tolerance for speculative space. And so, that I think -- those are the things that we\u2019re judging as we think about what we need to lease the building, but there is no number. Owen Thomas : And the only thing I would add to what Doug said is in terms of the marketplace, look, it is a thin market to find a tenant of the scale that Doug is describing. There are tenants out there that are interested in new construction that our of scale. The good news is, there is not that many options for such a tenant. And we do think that this is one of the absolute best large tenant sites in New York. So, we will be accessing that demand as the market evolves in the coming quarters. Blaine Heck : Okay, appreciate the color. That\u2019s very satisfactory at this point. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rob Simone with Evercore ISI. Rob Simone : Just a follow-up on the same-store guidance question from earlier. And I know, you guys obviously aren\u2019t talking about \u201819 yet. But just kind like of piecing that question together with the fact that most of the cash revenues isn\u2019t going to starting hitting your P&L until the fourth quarter of next year. Is there any reason to assume, are there any kind of like one-timers or large leases that could result in whatever you guys print in the fourth quarter on a same-store basis, kind of being not being the run rate through the majority of \u201819? Owen Thomas : We\u2019ve done a number of early renewals over the last couple of years in San Francisco, in Cambridge, in Boston. And those were deals that were expiring in \u201818, \u201819, \u201820. We\u2019ve got some embedded kind of casting growth that is going to come out of that stuff, in addition to the increase that we\u2019ll get when we refill and get cash started at 399. Rob Simone : Got it. So, it could -- it sounds -- like based upon that, it sounds like it could be higher potentially versus Q4, just trying to read the tea leaves there. Mike LaBelle : We can\u2019t really give guidance right now for what it\u2019s going to be in 2019. But, I do feel like we\u2019ve got some embedded growth that we\u2019ve talked about that is coming and that our AFFO will be better in 2019 than it is in 2018. Rob Simone : Okay. Thanks, Mike. And just a quick follow-up. It sounds like -- and you guys have been pretty clear about this. Interest expense being a pretty significant swing factor for next year. And I was just wondering, you mentioned in your prepared remarks. That it sounds like there\u2019s lower net interest expense for the back half of the year of about $0.02. Is that all attributable to the loan you guys originated on 3 Hudson or is there something else kind of in there that\u2019s moving it around. Mike LaBelle : It\u2019s a little more capitalized interest, and we had a little bit more cash than we expected. So, it\u2019s kind of on the margin. But, for next year, I think, it is important for people to understand that Salesforce Tower I think right now is 28% in service or something like that. So, there\u2019s still 72% capitalized interest on $1 billion project. And it goes away on 12/31/18. And again, the income is going to be coming in throughout \u201819. But there\u2019s kind of a mismatch there that I\u2019m not sure people fully understand. Typically, you kind of model that -- the capitalized interest goes away, as the income goes away and there\u2019s kind of a match there. But gap rules require us to cut it off 12 months from the date that the building is delivered. And that\u2019s great, if you have a 300,000 square-foot building that you\u2019re delivering, because you can deliver 300,000 square foot with the space and build it out within 12 months. But when you\u2019re building a 1.4 million square foot building, even though it\u2019s 98% leased, it just takes longer to get all those tenants built. So, for these very, very large buildings, there tends to be kind of a mismatch. So, I think that\u2019s an impact that we have. And then, the other thing is that we are going to be using, as you move into \u201819, we are going to be using debt for nearly all of the new development funding that we do. So, that debt is going to be roughly equal to what we\u2019re capitalizing. So, we\u2019re going to kind of lose what we deliver this year. So, that does have a pretty significant impact on the interest expense. The other item that also affects \u201819 and I mentioned it last quarter, I didn\u2019t mention it this quarter, but it\u2019s these -- the counting change for the leasing costs. So, as I mentioned last quarter, that\u2019s $0.04 to $0.06 negative to us in \u201819 versus \u201818. So, that\u2019s another thing to just keep in mind. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Rich Anderson : Doug, you mentioned the obvious that you can\u2019t control the build out timing of the space and speaking specifically at 399. I\u2019m wondering, as you\u2019re going through the kind of these -- just buttoning up this leasing process there. If you\u2019re paying attention to the individual circumstances, I\u2019m sure you are of incoming potential tenants in terms of where they\u2019re at now, what their sense of urgency would be to build out the space, so that you don\u2019t have a situation where you\u2019re waiting to recognize revenue because they\u2019re taking longer than you had hoped to get into the space? Doug Linde : We are absolutely are cognizant of those issues. And in some cases, we hope the tenants are actually in a rush to build out their space, and in fact one of the cases, they are. Still going to take them 12 plus months to start their design, get their construction permits, bid it and then build it out. So, the timeframes are not going to be significantly different than what we anticipate. But, we are clearly cognizant of that and we know when their lease expirations are. And so, we know how much \u201ctime they have between the leases\u201d. The other issue is that in certain cases, because these are financial services companies for the most part, there\u2019s a commissioning of the space that also needs to occur with all their systems, because they\u2019re -- they can\u2019t simply shut down on a Friday and moving on Monday by moving their computers. They actually have to rebuild and basically start up. And so, the good news is that will hopefully drive them to be more cognizant of getting in their space a little earlier than they would otherwise. Rich Anderson : Do you have some negotiating leverage, if they\u2019re like literally taking way too long, where at some point they just -- you just get to start recognizing revenue, if it lags on to too far into the future? Owen Thomas : At some point, it\u2019s deemed that they\u2019re already paying cash rent and it\u2019s deemed that they\u2019re not going to be building out anytime soon. We can start to make the argument that we should be able to turn revenue on. Because obviously it doesn\u2019t make sense to wait until the last day of the lease and suddenly recognize 10 years worth of lease in one day. So, yes, those situations -- they have occurred. There\u2019s people that kind of take space protectively and they don\u2019t build it out right away. And we have to make some judgment decisions in those. Rich Anderson : Second question is a larger picture. A lot of talk about being in later part of this real estate cycle. And I always get the question why should I own REITs, if that\u2019s the case. And I\u2019m curious how you might respond to that question. And are you feeling some added pressure to button some of these leases up before the music stops, be it economically or what have you that might influence a slowing down of this current nine-year cycle? Owen Thomas : On your question a couple of reactions. I mean, first of all, are we in the ninth inning of whatever of this economic cycle\u2026 Rich Anderson : We are in the ninth year, so not to use the baseball analogy. Owen Thomas : Yes. I don\u2019t have a clear crystal ball on this. I even mentioned in my remarks that we don\u2019t see a downturn at imminent. We are clearly -- our instinct is we are closer to the end and the beginning but there are lots of positive things going on in the market. And I think there are some lags. So, that\u2019s one reaction. The second is, when I think about at least our company and some extent is true with other companies, a lot of the growth that we\u2019ve been talking about on this call and in previous calls is not as economically sensitive as a typical corporation. So, a lot of the growth that we are going to experience as a company next year is delivering the Salesforce Tower which is 98% leased, and it\u2019s coming on our book. And I\u2019m not suggesting that an economic downturn wouldn\u2019t have some impact on our outcomes. But again, a lot of our growth is in developments that are leased in the 80s on percent basis. And our average lease term for the existing plan is over seven years. So, I think we are -- in terms of growth and results, less economically sensitive than a typical corporation. Also, certainly true of our company and others in our space, we think the stock is on sale relative to the value of the underlying assets. So, that should provide some kind of cushion. And as also described earlier, in recognition of this lack of having a clear crystal ball, we are keeping our leverage low. We are not leveraging up the company and taking more risk by doing that. We are keeping the leverage low, which should allow us to weather any storms that might be out there and frankly take advantage of anything that comes up. In terms of pressure to do things. I mean, look, we always feel pressure to have our buildings flow and generate income. So, I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve accelerated any leasing plans because of some downturn that we see as imminent. Doug and I have described over the last year or so that we have bumped our pre-letting requirements for development. And that is the way that we are expressing that we are later in the cycle and prepared to take a little bit less risk. So, I hope that helps you with the conversations you\u2019re having. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : One of your neighbors in San Francisco cited litigation expense this quarter in relation to Millennium Tower. And I didn\u2019t hear you guys really talk about this. But, are you involved in this case at all and experiencing similar costs? Owen Thomas : We are absolutely involved in the case. I think, the TJPA, 350 Mission, every contractor who has put a shovel in the ground in and around that site over the last seven or eight years, every design professional is part of this. We are not going to comment on the litigation other than to say, we don\u2019t expect any material liability or we would have disclosed in our K and our Qs. And our legal expenses are being capitalized into Salesforce Tower at the moment. So, that\u2019s why you don\u2019t see any \u201cdisclosure\u201d of what were spending. John Kim : And as far as the resolution or the proposed resolution of fixing the problem, do you foresee any potential business interruption at Salesforce Tower? Owen Thomas : All I can tell you is that we don\u2019t expect any material liability associated with this. John Kim : Okay. At Santa Monica Business Park, could you enter acquiring this asset with CPP [ph] in mind as a partner? And if not, can you discuss what demand was like from other potential partners for this asset? Owen Thomas : Yes. We did decide early in the process that we -- we thought we should bring in a capital partner in this particular acquisition for the reasons that we described which is to preserve our public equity capital. So, I think the decision to bring in a partner was made prior to us committing to the deal. And we talked about that on the last call. There was interest, certainly about CPP, but also about other potential partners in that particular investment. And as I mentioned earlier in my remarks, I think the private equity capital market for real estate is quite healthy and there are multiple investors that are underfunded in real estate and want more exposure. John Kim : My final question is at Signature at Reston, it\u2019s now fully placed in service as far as multifamily, retail. You\u2019ve done some leasing progress there. But how are the effective rents and lease-up periods compared to your underwriting, just given the amount of supply and do you potential market in multifamily? Doug Linde : So, John, I guess, I tried to describe what I think is going on, by basically saying that the existing apartment building across the street is actually at 95% occupied with an increase in rents year to year when the Signature was not open. My implication to that was that we are well in line with our pro forma rents. The leasing is progressing. I would say if you put a lie detector on me, I would say that we would have liked been slightly higher leased. But the fact of the matter is that we just opened up the retail at the base of the building. And when we started the building and did our pro forma, we didn\u2019t anticipate having signed a lease with [indiscernible] for 270,000 building across the street where there is a whole on the ground in a little bit of noise and construction activities. So, there is a little bit of self-inflicted slowdown in the lease-up that we had to get through, but we\u2019re actively moving through it. Owen Thomas : I would just additional, just like the office market, the residential multifamily in the Town Center itself dramatically outperforms the general Northern Virginia market. Operator : Your next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jamie Feldman : I just want to go back to Ray for a moment. I appreciate your thoughts on GSA. But, can you talk about the defense budget and the increase in spending and what you\u2019re seeing so far in terms of that translating into office demand? And what you think will happen going forward, given we\u2019re getting closer and closer to the end of the fiscal year? Ray Ritchey : Yes. I think that we\u2019ve been under a contracting environment on the defense side for so long that even just a stay put on the budget or a modest increase would trigger demand. All these users have gotten down to an efficiency level that I don\u2019t think is sustainable. And we\u2019re seeing it Reston where we\u2019re receiving a lot of our defense contractors or people that are doing business with the government, major engineering companies are coming to us with some growth that is quite welcome related to what we\u2019ve seen over the last 7 or 8 years. So, yes, we\u2019re very positive about future demand. Very little spec space is being built, certainly the Dallas Corridor. So, as it relates to Reston, we think there\u2019s good signals ahead for increasing demand. Jamie Feldman : And is the type of buildings these tenants are looking for different from prior cycles? I know Reston fits in well as high-amenity type location, like, it is different this time or do you think will go back to similar buildings? Ray Ritchey : Yes. Just as, there is demand for talent in all of our markets, there is tremendous demand for talent in the Dallas Corridor. So, the concept of going to a Greenfield office park with no amenities to recruit and retain the best and brightest is not the right way to go in the Dallas Corridor. So, the same demand we\u2019re just seeing from corporate users, we\u2019re seeing from the defense. They want the amenity base we have in Reston town center. Jamie Feldman : Okay. Thank you. And then, just the last question for me. Owen, to your comment about not raising leverage, do you -- are you thinking more about asset sales, might we see more dilution going forward from larger asset sales than we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of quarters? Owen Thomas : Only non-core assets. As I mentioned, we are having a pretty active year selling non-core assets. So, I think we\u2019ll exceed the $300 million target. But, as I mentioned in my remarks, the selling of our -- most of our core assets involve a significant gain and a special dividend and a dilution to FFO. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Just on sort of the leasing progress for some of the other assets apart from 399, which you see pretty well on track there. Can you just -- maybe 70 million or 80 million of incremental, can you talk about at some of the other properties, 611 Gateway, Colorado Center, Embarcadero, just what\u2019s the sense of timing of lease-up for those assets? Doug Linde : Yes. So, I will try and reiterate what I said. So, I\u2019ll start with a simple one. So, we\u2019ve already leased Colorado Center. And the revenue in Colorado Center is part of our slight increase for this year. So, we\u2019re 98% leased. So, there\u2019s not much to do there. At Embarcadero Center, I talked about the bank consulting space which is the one block that we had when the one tenant from the portfolio left to go to Salesforce Tower. There\u2019s a little bit of musical chairs going on because the tenant is taking spaces and existing and coming tenant, but we have another tenant outside of the project that\u2019s looking at that space. And we have -- again, we have these four floors at Embarcadero Center 4 that we are in two cases converting to, what I would refer to as more tech oriented space creative office. And so, we think we\u2019re going to be very successful in leasing that up and that construction is going to begin prior to the end of this year and hopefully be done before the end of the first quarter of 2019, which is where our major availability is there. In Boston, I think, I described that we\u2019re 95% leased. So, there\u2019s not a lot to do there. 611 Gateway, we\u2019re leasing about 50,000 square feet a year right now. We actually have, probably get the 80,000 square feet in 2018, still leaves about 40,000 or 50,000 square feet of space that\u2019s going to be rented at $42 a square foot plus or minus, so $4 million or $1.6 million. So, it\u2019s not a lot of revenue. So that -- I think the rest of the portfolio is doing very well. We do have a few other pieces of high value space in New York City at the General Motors building. We actually have a lease out on the majority of one of the floors which we hope to sign in this calendar quarter. And that will likely have a revenue recognition sometime in late 2019 as well, and that\u2019s high revenue space. So, the rest of the portfolio is doing very well. If you force me to go back to 2016 and talk about our \u201crevenue bridge\u201d, we are within spitting distance of having everything done on that \u201c$160 million\u201d of revenue. Vikram Malhotra : And then, just in New York, I guess, you referred to firming up or maybe stabilization in things like TIs et cetera. I\u2019m just sort of wondering, some of your peers have been optimistic about overall Midtown rents turning positive and maybe trending upward over the next six to nine months. Do you share that view and anything to share on your sense of where New York fundamentals would be over the next 6 to 12 months? Doug Linde :  I think the house view -- and I\u2019ll let John give you his perspective, is that lease transaction economics in the form of pre-rent in TIs [ph] has stabilized. They are not coming down per se. And rents are flat and they are largely due to the fact that there continues to be a significant amount of new construction that\u2019s occurring. There are places where tenants can go. The better space is being leased and the better built space in those buildings that have gone through on major capital refreshment are the haves, and there are a bunch of have-nots out there. So, we think it\u2019s sort of steady as she goes. There is not going to be significant, if any rental rate expansion over the next few years. John, any other thought? John Powers : No. I would say leasing activity is very strong. We had a very, very good first half of the year, but the development has added supply to the market. So, that\u2019s kept the availability rate from dropping with the leasing activity. And as a the result of that -- net result of that is what Doug says, it\u2019s a pretty flat market, although a very active one. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors. Jed Reagan : Just going back to an earlier question about Santa Monica Business Park. That seems like an attractive addition to the portfolio and it\u2019s consistent with the strategy of growing in LA. Just given that, I wonder how you thought through the decision to partner on that asset rather than doing it a 100% on your own and kind of maximizing your LA presence, and why raising capital through that asset made more sense than just selling an incremental non-core asset? I know you touched briefly on that on the last call but if you could just expand on that a little bit. Owen Thomas : Yes. When we sell a non-core -- when we sell a core asset, almost all of our core assets have a significant tax gain in them, so that creates a special dividend which we -- dividend to shareholders. We don\u2019t keep the money. So, we can\u2019t use that capital to make a new acquisition. So, it\u2019s extremely inefficient source of capital, in that if you look at it that way. So, in the case of Santa Monica, we thought it was a good opportunity to bring in a partner that -- we think the yield is attractive, it is lower on a stabilized basis than the developments than we are doing. So that was part of the decision. And we have a -- it\u2019s very active development pipeline and we want to keep our leverage at the current levels. And so, we thought it was an appropriate area to raise equity capital in the private market. Jed Reagan : How about contrasting it to a non-core asset or lower growth asset where maybe you\u2019ve got sort of a stabilized cash flow versus potentially good upside for this asset? Owen Thomas : Jed, the other point is, we have a partner in our other deal in Santa Monica as well. We didn\u2019t bring that one in, we inherited that because we bought a half interest. So, actually both our deals in Santa Monica are 50-50. So, again, I\u2019d kind of go back to the first answer, the first question the, the sell on asset to raise money, given the tax basis in most of our assets we can\u2019t, if we did it, even if we get a great price, if we did it that we can\u2019t use most -- or a lot of the capital if not most of the capital to make new investments, that\u2019s not a source of funding for this kind of activity. Jed Reagan : Okay, thanks. And there was a recent measure passed in San Francisco Prop C that would introduce 3.5% gross receipts tax on office landlords in town. Just curious to get your take on whether you think that measure is going to stand up ultimately. And if so, how much of the tax burden you think get passed along to tenants in the long run? Doug Linde : So, I\u2019ll answer the question on the economics and I\u2019m going to not be able to give you my sense or our sense on the weather it will be repealed. It was a 51-49 vote for. It\u2019s unclear whether or not that will withstand both legal litigation as well as a revote if they were to do that. Our leases, we have structured, allow us to recover these types of increases in the costs associated with what I refer to as taxes. So, on the margin, we have vacant space. And so in those cases, there may be some revenue that we -- depending upon way all the leases are structured that would be pushed to the landlord, but vast majority of this is reimbursed. Jed Reagan : And how about when the lease expires five years down the road? Doug Linde : The new lease will have language in it that we believe will allow us to pass along this, pass probably in a more precise way. Jed Reagan : Okay. And then maybe just a last one I think and related to that. There has been talk of getting new Prop M allocations added back to the Q and San Francisco to account for office buildings that have been converted to resi or other uses, maybe 1.5 million order of magnitude. Give me visibility into that process and the chances that it goes through and maybe how it could affect your plans? Doug Linde : Sure. Bob, do you want to just describe what you -- what your understanding is and sort of where that \u201clegislation\u201d may be. Bob Pester : Yes. Legislation has been submitted by supervisor Peskin, and we think it will pass. As far as our plans, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to have any material impact because I think the city\u2019s going to divvy up the Prop M allocation amongst all the Central SoMa sites. Operator : We have time for one final question and that question comes from John Guinee with Stifel. John Guinee : Hey, Ray Ritchey, you and -- I guess, you and LeBron James are active in LA now. Now that you\u2019ve been out there, west of the 405 Beverly Hills, Westwood, is it or is it not possible to do the new build? Ray Ritchey : Well, that\u2019s -- of course Owen could comment on this as well. It\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019re picking up sites like the Santa Monica Business Park. The barriers to entry in West LA are the strongest of any market we see in the country. And so, when we get a chance to acquire 40 some acres in Santa Monica and we will certainly jump on it. And given the success we\u2019ve had at Colorado Center where almost exactly two years ago, we bought it a 65% leased, we\u2019re effectively 100% today, just validates both the scarcity of sites and the unbelievable amount of tech demand in that marketplace. So, any chance we get to acquire any asset, be it a development site or a new acquisition, we\u2019re going to take advantage of it. But, the answer to your question specifically John, it\u2019s the tightest market in terms of developable sites we\u2019ve ever seen. John Guinee : But, is it impossible or possible to up-zone, et cetera or is it just will we never see another square foot? Ray Ritchey : The city Santa Monica, I\u2019d say it\u2019s virtually impossible to up-zone. OT, do you have any comment on that? Owen Thomas : These things are hard to define, John. There\u2019s no question that what Ray described is accurate. And it\u2019s one of the attractiveness -- we think one of the attractive features of the investments that we\u2019ve made is there\u2019s a lot of protection in new supply. But, with time, you never know how these things are going to evolve and how the local community\u2019s posture toward these issues will evolve. John Guinee : Thank you. Owen Thomas : I\u2019m impressed you got back in the queue, John. How did you do that? John Guinee : I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s divine, I think. Owen Thomas : All right. Very good. I think that concludes all the questions for today, and thank all of you for your interest in Boston Properties. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s Boston Properties conference call. Thank you again for attending, and have a good day.",

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks. Owen Thomas : Thank you Sara, and good morning everyone. Just wanted to give everyone a heads up that we have the Red Sox victory parade coming down Boylston Street at 11 o'clock this morning, so I'll do my best to keep all the Red Sox fans around the table in their seats after 11 :00.  Before I get into the details of the quarter let me take a step back and review the macro environment we're experiencing and why it is an exciting time to be part of Boston Properties. The markets where we operate continue to display strong economic performance. Unemployment is at record lows and our tenants continue to seek high quality Class A properties to attract and retain their most precious asset which is talent and the urbanization trend continues as companies and their employees seek the opportunity, community and amenities of urban locations. Boston Properties is in the middle of and benefiting from these macro trends and the investments we've made over the past few years and new development are positioning us for growth with a high level of preleasing and new developments and a long average lease term in the existing portfolio, our growth is durable and much less sensitive to where we might be in the business cycle.  And finally our tenant base is diversified across market sectors and our assets across geographies which insulates us in the event of a market shift within a sector or geography. Our strategy of developing and owning Class A office properties in top tier gateway cities continues to serve us well and provides a long term competitive advantage in creating value for shareholders.  Now let's get into the details of the third quarter which was another strong one for us as we made additional progress towards achieving our annual and long term goal. Specifically this quarter we generated FFO per share $0.02 above the midpoint of our prior forecast and $0.01 above Street consensus. On a year over year basis FFO per share grew 4% in the third quarter. We also increased our full year guidance for 2018 by $0.02.  We also increased our regular quarterly cash dividend by 19% to $0.95 per share. The largest dividend increase in the history of Boston Properties. And finally we provided a strong outlook for 2019, forecasting FFO per share growth of 7% at the midpoint of our range. We've been describing for some time our inflection point of growth based on our strong development pipeline and in-service portfolio performance. With our FFO momentum this quarter and strong outlook for 2019 that inflection point is now evident.  Moving to business highlights in the quarter, we leased a 1.5 million square feet bringing us to 5.4 million square feet leased in the first three quarters well above our historical averages. We increased our in-service portfolio occupancy 70 basis points from last quarter to 91.1%. And we continue to lead in sustainability performance having been recently ranked in the top 8% of all property companies globally by [indiscernible] and we earned LEED Platinum certification for the Salesforce Tower in San Francisco.  Overall it was a strong quarter and I am pleased with our ongoing financial performance and the underlying strength of the business as we approach 2019.  Now let's discuss the market environment and trends impacting the business. Overall economic conditions remain very positive, with third quarter US GDP growth recently reported at 3.5% which is still quite strong but down from 4.2% in the second quarter. 134,000 jobs were created in September which is also healthy, but below the monthly average over the past year. And the unemployment rate dropped to a 50 year low at 3.7%. Notwithstanding the strength of the US economy capital markets became volatile over the last month. The Fed increased rates 25 basis points in September. It's signaling at least for now an additional increase before the end of the year and multiple increases in 2019. The ten year US treasury increased rapidly earlier this year to over 3.2% and it's currently trading a little above 3.1%, up only 10 basis points since our last earnings call and about 60 basis points since the beginning of the year. A combination of interest rate increases both realized and forecast, slowing economic growth, concerns about trade wars, uncertainty around the upcoming midterm elections and the extended duration of the US economic recovery have led to materially increased volatility in the equity markets and for REIT. We've remain constructive on the market environment notwithstanding the volatility. The positive impacts of the economic growth to our leasing results far outweigh any negative of the modest interest rate increases we have experienced so far. Further current level of long term interest rate is favorable relative to historical norms and the returns we were experiencing at our new investments.  While we are disappointed with the movements of our share price relative to our dividend increase and forecast growth it does not impact our capital strategy in that we are not funding our new investments with public equity. Our best use of capital today is launching new preleased developments and making select value added acquisitions for which the yields are higher than both stabilized property acquisition and the incurred cap rate and repurchasing our shares notwithstanding their material discount to NAV. Our best and cheapest source of capital is debt financing which we can utilize without materially changing our credit profile due to the new debt capacity provided by the income from our development deliveries. We have and will continue to sale select non-core assets which raises capital on the margin. The sale of the larger core asset is a less sufficient funding source given significant embedded tax gains in the result of special dividend requirements. We can accomplish our growth plan without accessing public equity capital given the debt capacity and deliver developments and if needed access to plentiful private equity capital. In the private real estate market, transaction volume growth remains healthy. Specifically US large asset transaction volume in the third quarter increased almost 3% from the second quarter and 10% over the third quarter of 2017. Office represented 36% of the transaction volume for the quarter and increased 5% from the second quarter of '18 and 3% year-to-date over 2017. Investor appetite remains strong with multiple significant office transactions agreed once again in our core markets at sub-5% cap rates. Examples of this include in Boston, the office and parking components of 121 Seaport in the Seaport District is under agreement to sell for $1129 per square foot and a 4.6% cap rate. This property comprises 400,000 square feet and is 100% leased and being purchased by Sovereign Wealth Investor.  In Los Angeles, Campus at Playa Vista is selling for 4.5% cap rate and a $1031 a square foot to Real Estate Pension Advisor. This property is 325,000 square feet and is 99% leased.  And lastly moving to St. Francisco, 301 Howard in the Soma District sold to a pension fund advisor for $919 a square foot and a cap rate in the high 4% range. This property is 319,000 square feet and fully leased.  Now, moving to our capital activity, development continues to be our primary strategy for creating value. We remain very active pursuing both new prelease projects and sites for future projects. Since our last earnings call, we continue to progress our development pipeline activity. We delivered into service our 280 unit proto residential project in Kendall Center and have leased approximately 49% of the residential units on track with our initial pro forma. We commenced active development of our 1.1 million square feet Western Gateway project for Fanny Mae. This two tower office complex is adjacent to the future Reston Town Center metro station and is the first phase of our proposed 4.2 million square foot expansion of Reston Town Center on land we owned and we have now \u2013 and have now rezoned. This project alone will provide Boston Property significant future growth opportunities.  We commenced active development of our 100 cause way officer tower development after securing our 440,000 square foot lease with Verizon Communication to anchor the 630,000 square foot, 31 story building. This is the last phase of our mix use [indiscernible] Causeway project in Boston, we are in discussions with an existing tenant at Kendall Center in Cambridge to redevelop 325 Main Street for their expansion, we hope to announce this investment by year-end and receive community approval in early 2019. As part of the proposed plan, we would also develop a residential tower on the same city block as our 1445 Broadway office property currently under development. Our current development and redevelopment pipeline stands at 14 office and residential projects comprising 7.6 million square feet and 4.1 billion of investment for our share. Most of the pipeline is well underway and we have 1.9 billion remaining to fund. The commercial component of this portfolio is 85% prelease and aggregate projected cash yield are estimated to continue to be approximately 7%. These figures exclude the $360 million, 2,100 Pennsylvania Avenue development in Washington D.C. which we expect to commence next year and the 325 Main Street Redevelopment discussed earlier.  And lastly on capital activity, we are having an active year selling non core assets and will most likely exceed our $300 million disposition target this year. We recently closed the sale of core office park in Chelmsford, Mass, to the major tenant in the park for $35 million and as a result have completed $185 million in disposition year-to-date. 1,333 New Hampshire Avenue in Washington D.C is under contract for sale to close before year end for a $136 million or $430 a square foot. Recall this asset will be vacated by Akin Gump in 2019 and then as is releasing of the building does not fit our current operating strategy. We continue to pursue recapitalization options for the 634,000 square foot build to suit for the TSA currently under construction in Springfield Virginia in order to free up capital for our growing development pipeline. This transaction can close this quarter or next.  Lastly we are in the market to sell 2600 Tower Oaks a 179,000 square foot office building located in Rockville Maryland and the last asset in our preserve at Tower Oaks Business Park. This transaction can close by year end or early 2019.  So in summary we had a strong third quarter, delivered FFO per share ahead of expectations, increased our 2018 outlook and materially increased our dividend. And finally our growth plan for 2019 is now sharply in focus and looking forward significant growth for 2020 and 2021 should continue with our new investment wins and healthy leasing activity.  Let me turn it over to Doug. Doug Linde : Thanks Owen. Good morning everybody. Before I get to the markets and make some comments on our leasing progress I want to make an observation about capital and the Office business. Our customers need to engage their employees to achieve great business outcomes and access to talent remains their top priority. When you're operating in a labor market where the unemployment rate is at historical lows particularly for college or higher degree level employees who are our customers' employee base space plays an important role in the valuation chain of the employee as they take that job.  A year ago we had our investor conference and we reviewed in detail, all the work we had done to rejuvenate our older assets. I think I went through about 20 million square feet of projects that we had completed since 2000 largely in our CBD properties and then we presented the new designs and the sense of place that we're bringing to our development which encompass 15 million square feet delivered since 2000 and the 7.6 million square feet that Owen just described is under development. When we do this work right we get premium rent. In Boston go see how we have transformed a 100 Central Street and you've all been to the Prudential Center retail makeover which has made a dramatic difference here.  The public spaces at Colorado Center are going to be completed in the second quarter of next year and by the summer when you visit our campus at 53rd in Lexington 599-601 and 399 you are going to see a major transformation of the public spaces. These are generational investments that we're making.  The one significant capital project remaining across our portfolio is the public space at Embarcadero Center. We\u2019ve owned the property since 1998 I think it will be 20 years next week or the week after. This is the first major architectural and place making project we have undertaken at the Property. We are reinventing the lobbies now ongoing about a $60 million three year project and then we're planning another $80 million common new area and place making investments over this 3.5 million square foot complex. So that's about $40 a square foot.  We will continue to spend $1.50 to $2 a square foot per year on traditional CapEx across the portfolio year in and year out but our portfolio has been fundamentally reinvented or is new.  So let me start in San Francisco on our market comments. With all the recent deliveries of 100% leased buildings the market absorption is at historical highs. One research firm calculated that the vacancy rate in CBD buildings built since 2000 is under 1%. There continues to be in more than a dozen 100,000 square foot office requirements in the market searching for space. We're going to do an event at Nareit next week where we will focus on the supply challenges in the area that are the result of the Prop M and the delays in the central SoMa plan. Even if there is a little legislative relief and no one is expecting Prop M to be overturned it won't manifest itself into new deliveries until the end of 2021 at best or later. The large block of contiguous available sublease space coming from tenants that are moving to new construction have disappeared. While transaction cost have not decreased. Rent growth is up high-single digits and more importantly leases now include annual escalations of between 2% and 3%. If you're doing a $90 ten year deal your average rent is over $104 and it ends up in a $120 per square foot rate. So I shudder to think about the roll downs, people are going to be talking about in 2028 or 2029. Our availability in this city is all in Embarcadero Center. This quarter we completed 73,000 square feet of office leasing in DC including a 60,000 square foot 3-floor tenant relocating into Embarcadero center from outside with just a 45% roll up in gross rent. There are currently seven available floors, four floors at Embarcadero Center available and we are negotiating leases or LOIs on every one of them.  In addition, we're in negotiations on 200,000 square feet of late 2019 and 2020 renewals to those renewal. And we are in lease on the 165,000 square foot block that PWC will vacate in July of 2020 where the roll up will probably be in excess of 50%. The Silicon Valley is also seen a pickup in activity. Transit oriented projects are the preferred alternative and we have commenced the reentitlement efforts on our Plaza at Almaden Project, which is just under a mile from the Diridon Transit Station adjacent to the plain Google Village. We hope to deliver up to 1.5 million square feet. And we've already have conversations with the number of Silicon Valley tech companies about the project. And not a new, this quarter we captured we've recaptured 40,000 square feet and released the space at a 40% net increase in rent. We have some expected rollover by 260,000 square feet at the very end of 2019 in our single story product. And that includes a 180,000 square foot relocated from the tenants that consolidating into a new third party development that's going to deliver sometime in 2020 interesting that their lease does expires in '19 and we'll see how that all plays out well after the lease expires.  Our average expiring in place rent on this space is $36 triple net and market is about $54 triple net. That's about a 50% increase. The Westside LA market remains steady with the number of large leases on the precipice of signing. Rents continue to be in the low to mid five where we've hired in our initial underwriting at Santa Monaca business Park to the low 6s. These are obviously monthly rents at Colorado Center where concessions have been pretty consistent for the past few quarters. There are limited large lock options west of the 405 and as everyone knows building new and large is a real challenge.  At Colorado Center, we completed a 58,000 square foot lease with the Scooter Rental Organization. And we are in discussions for our last remaining 14,000 square feet that would get us to 100% leased. We're assimilating the Santa Monaca Business Park into our operations and have hired a dedicated leasing director in LA to handle our day-to-day activities at both properties.  Switching to New York City. Overall leasing activity in the market continues to be strong and conditions in midtown is stable. Meaning availability is steady with flat concessions and flat rental growth. Buildings that have invested capital have healthy activity. Transactions are being completed in the high-end market i.e. over $100 a square foot at a pace pretty consistent with last year where about 1.5 million square feet of relocations were signed. Those spaces still relatively moderate. In other words in the third quarter, there were about 290,000 square feet of deals above $100 a square foot over 16 transactions. And the third and the fourth largest were 25000 square feet which was at our building at 767 Fifth Avenue and 20000 square feet. Last quarter I described our activity at 399 Park. The picture remains the same. We are negotiating leases for the block on 7 8 9 and 10, 250,000 square feet as well as the three of the four floors on 18 through 21. We did have a 70000 square foot tenant walk away at lease execution in September after our call. But we are already negotiating a replacement lease for that space. In addition, we completed an early recapture of 75000 square feet that was leased through October of 2021 in a simultaneous lease with a new tenant that runs through 2035 at an 18% increase in gross rent. As we mentioned during our last call, we have signed a lease for 100% of the office space at One Side 90-50 Third Street and we expect that to commence at the end of 2019.  Moving now to D.C. Activity in the District of Columbia continues to be restrained. The good news is that the shared office operators continue to lease direct space and more importantly fill their communities with lots of associations and startups and individuals and even some educational organizations aggregating demand that we would not otherwise serve. However, space reductions and consolidations from the GSA the significant amount of repositioned assets, new supply and the long lead forward leasing continue to be headwinds on the market in the city. Concessions continue to be at historically high levels while rents and annual escalations have remained steady.  Once again our activity is concentrated in Reston where unlike the CBD we continue to see strong growing demand from our incumbent technology and defense industry tenants.  This quarter we completed 163000 square foot expansion and extension with a technology company. And we continue to have over 400,000 square feet of additional leases in negotiations. Rents in Reston range from the mid 40s to the mid 50s for existing products and we expect them to remain flat for 2019. Concessions have remained stable. Owen mentioned the new entitlements in Reston. This encompasses 1.6 million square feet of office space including the 1.1 million square feet we\u2019ve commenced at the Reston Gateway as well as 1.9 million square feet of residential and the site has a direct bridge over Sunset Hill Road to the new metro station which is being built on property, we dedicated to the Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority. That's about as close to adjacent as you can get. Our tightest portfolio continues to be in Boston where we're 95% leased. There is very little available space and large blocks in the Boston CBD market and there continues to be strong demand which has led to a tightening of concessions and an increase in rents both in absolute terms, low teens year to year increases and rents from the high 50s to an excess $85 on a gross basis in the CBD along with annual escalations which is a new trend.  The absorption and large leasing use this quarter is a result of deliveries of fully leased new product the leases that were done in previous quarters. The 100 Causeway Tower is 70% leased but we're in discussions with two tenants for the remainder about 180,000 square feet of this building which would get us to 100% committed. Other than the 440,000 square foot Verizon lease, our largest transaction in Boston this quarter involved the early recapture and we don't have any available space of 58000 square feet at 200 Claritin which was expiring in 2022 and a release of that space through 2035. Our largest negotiation in the region now involves another multi floor tenant with an expiration in 2022. In Cambridge, we completed an expansion with an existing tenant for 83,000 square feet at 90 Broadway Cambridge office rents are now in the mid 70s triple net. Even as many tenants are attracted to the city center of Boston and Cambridge there continues to be significant demand in the Waltham Lexington suburban market. This quarter we completed our second deal at 20 city point so it's now 53% leased from -- with a tenant in our portfolio that\u2019s relocating but we\u2019re negotiating a lease that back build a 100% of their space with another growing tenant in the portfolio. New construction office rents in this market are about $30 triple net. Growing life science demand continues to impact the market, we have a few suburban properties in Waltham and Lexington, leased to office tenants where the current net rents are currently in the low 20s. We\u2019re now working with the life science tenants to convert these building to lab office use with investments of about $100 per square foot on the base building and expect to achieve the rents in the high 40s on a triple net basis. So, it takes us 12 months to do the work with the downtime we\u2019re generating around 15% to 20% incremental return on net dollars.  Before I finished, I want to provide some color on the same property leasing statistics for the New York City region this quarter and our companywide releasing capital cost. The pool of deals in the second generation New York City portfolio totaled a 103,000 square feet. It includes a large piece of mezzanine space that we got back from Citi Bank, under the original 2003 lease where Citi leased all of the space in the building at the same rent in the mid 90s. We re-let the space which is not accessed through the elevator lobby at the 75% decline in net rents, eliminating that lease results in the gross rent decline moving from the 31% to 13% a really big difference.  Now on the transaction cost side, there are number of [indiscernible] that are part of the transaction cost this quarter and since the first lease is only three to five years the average transaction cost per lease here is artificially high. In addition, we leased the 6,000 square foot piece of retail space on Madison Avenue at the General Motors building for 16 years at a very, very healthy rent and we provided the large TI allowance equivalent to year rents plus a commission which obviously impacted our concession packages this quarter in our staff.  So to conclude, tenant demand for high quality workspace remains strong as the fight for talent continues to be a primary focus for our customers. Leasing economic are very favorable in San Francisco and Boston. Our activity at 399 Park Avenue is on track and improvement in our expectations of delivery timing of the some of the vacant space at 399 Avenue in 2019 is partially driving our guidance which Mike will discuss in his remarks. Mike? Mike LaBelle : Excellent. Thank you Doug. We had a great quarter, strong quarter in the third quarter if you look at our share of total revenues they were up nearly 5%, our portfolio occupancy was up 70 basis points from last quarter and our cash in property NOI improved it was up 2.5% over the same quarter last year. Third quarter funds from operation came in at $1.64 per share as Owen mentioned that $0.02 per share about $3 million ahead of the midpoint of our guidance range. The primary driver of the improvement was stronger development and management services fee income mostly from our joint ventures. As this joint venture portfolio grows with acquisitions like Santa Monica Business Park and new development like the Hub on Causeway on office tower, we do benefit from enhance opportunities to drive higher fee income. For the remainder of 2018, we project portfolio NOI growth with occupancy gains driving higher quarter-over-quarter same property portfolio results plus incremental income from our development as additional square footage at Salesforce tower is placed into service. Our run-rate for fee income should moderate due to $6 million of leasing commissions we earned in the third quarter that will likely not recur. And as we mentioned before, we expect higher interest expenses. We will stop capitalizing interest on our investment in Salesforce Tower on December 1 of 2018. And we also expect higher usage on our line of credit.  Overall, we are increasing our guidance for full year 2018 funds from operations to $6.39 to $6.41 per share. We project our fourth quarter FFO to be a $1.68 to a $1.70 per share which is an increase of $0.05 per share at the midpoint over our Q3 performance. We provided detailed guidance for 2019 last night in our supplemental reports that's available on our website. And as we look ahead to 2019, we are projecting accelerating FFO from increases in occupancy and revenue increases on our lease role, additional income from the delivery and stabilization of our developments, partially offset by an increase of interest expense as we discontinue capitalized interest on those same developments.  In the portfolio, we project gaining occupancy during 2019 and should average between 91.5% and 93%, up 150 basis points from this year. We project ending 2019 just shy of 93% occupancy so we are on track to meet our commitment of 93% occupancy by 2020.  Our Boston portfolio was currently 95% leased, and we've already leased the majority of our available space in the CBD though occupancy and revenue recognition will not occur until 2019. This includes 50,000 square feet of 111 Huntington, 50,000 of 100 Federal Street and nearly all of the remaining space at 888 Boylston Street. We expect Cambridge which is currently 98% leased to be back to 100% by midyear and our suburban portfolio will also improve as we have 75,000 square feet of vacancy at Reservoir Place North that will be filled with the signed lease taking occupancy in the first quarter of 2019.  In San Francisco, Doug described the level of activity that we have on our 260,000 square feet of office vacancy at Embarcadero Center. And we expect positive absorption of roughly two thirds of this space next year. We also have 175,000 square feet of lease rollover next year in Embarcadero Center where the current rents are significantly below market. In New York City, we're making additional progress leasing 399 Park Avenue and by the year-end 2019, we anticipate recognizing revenue on most of the 440,000 square feet of currently vacant space. As Doug mentioned, we have either signed leases or leases in negotiation on all of the 25,000 square feet of this space.  In Reston Town Center we have minimal rollover next year and expect to increase occupancy from 92% to near 97%. The only place where we anticipate losing occupancy is in Washington DC and it's primarily at Metropolitan Square and 901, New York Avenue, each of which has sizable law firm vacating next year. Both of these buildings are held in joint venture. So the economic impact to us is less.  With our expected occupancy gains, combined with continued rollup in rent primarily in Boston and San Francisco, our guidance assumes that our share of same property portfolio NOI increases by 3.5% to 5.5% on a GAAP basis and by 4.5% to 6.5% on a cash basis from 2018. Our cash NOI is increasing faster than GAAP partially due to previous early renewal activity where the rental rate increases have already been blended into our GAAP rents. And the cash increase is occurring in 2019. We expect non cash straight line and fair value rent of $75 million to a $100 million in 2019 and the fair value rent component of this is only $18 million. Our projected same property growth would actually be even higher if not for three lease terminations that we are working on where we have near term expiries that we\u2019re pulling forward into 2019 to accommodate new or expanding tenants. This is moving approximately $10 million of our same property income into the termination income bucket, this is just geography and it does not impact our earnings, it will reduce our near term rollover exposure, reduce downtime and capture higher rents sooner on each space.  Our guidance for 2019 assumes termination income of $10 million to $15 million versus $6 million at the midpoint in 2018. Our 2019 projected same property NOI growth would be 70 basis points higher if we were proactively creating the termination income to enhance long-term value. We\u2019re projecting our income from development and management services to decline modestly in 2019 and range from $37 million to $42 million. This decline is due to leasing commissions earned during 2018 due to higher occupancy in our unconsolidated joint venture portfolio we don\u2019t expect these commissions to recur at the same level in 2019. In our non- same portfolio which is primarily our development deliveries, we project incremental NOI growth in 2019 of $80 million to $90 million, this projection also includes our share of NOI after interest expense from a full year of owning Santa Monica Business Park. I\u2019m quoting this net of the interest expense because the result of Santa Monica Business Park flow into our income from joint venture line so they do not impact interest expense.  Over half of this incremental NOI growth is from Salesforce Tower where we expect to commence revenue on all of the remaining space, all of the space is subject to signed leases now and the property will reach a 100% occupancy by the end of third quarter of 2019. We also projecting growth from the lease up of our two residential projects that we delivered earlier this year and Hub on Causeway Podium and 20 City Point both of which deliver in the third quarter of 2019 and are substantially leased. Our developments at 159, East 53rd Street in the New York City and 145 Broadway in Cambridge delivered at the tail end of 2019, so they will have a modest impact to the year, but both properties are preleased so we expect that they would be at their full run rate in 2020.  We are funding a portion of our development pipeline with asset sales. We expect dispositions of approximately $370 million this year, these dispositions include year-to-date plus 1,333 New Hampshire and a land parcel in Maryland both of which are under contract with non refundable deposits. We project the incremental NOI loss to 2019 from our disposition activity to be approximately $12 million. We have not included any additional dispositions in our projection that we are considering the sale of additional non core assets. We are also raising additional debt to fund our pipeline, we project our development spend through 2019 to be approximately $250 million per quarter and it will be funded by access cash flow proceeds from the aforementioned asset sales and our line of credit. We also expect to buyout the remaining 5% interest in Salesforce Tower in early 2019. As a result of these funding needs, we project our net interest expense to grow between $418 million and $433 million for 2019. We project our capitalized interest to be between $45 million and $55 million approximately $15 million less than 2018, primarily from the impact of staffing capitalized interest on Salesforce Tower.  We anticipate that we will term out of the projected outstandings under our line of credit sometime in mid 2019 with a long term financing. We also have a $700 million dollar bond issuance that carries an interest rate of 5 and 7/8% that matures in October of next year. We believe that we can replace this bond with a 10 year new issue and reduce the interest rate by approximately 150 basis points. Based on our capital needs and our desire to lock-in a lower rate for our bond refinancing, we may pull forward the $700 million refinancing until late 2018. If we elect to do this we would incur a charge to our earnings in 2018 but we'll be locking in current low rates and reducing our interest expense going forward. We've not included the impact of a potential refinancing in our earnings guidance. As I described in the last two quarters, starting in 2019 the new lease accounting rules will require to expense internal wages both for our leasing professionals and outside legal costs that were previously capitalized. This does not impact our cash flow as we've always made these payments but it will increase our G&A expense under GAAP. In 2019 we project that our G&A expense will total $134 million to a $140 million. And that reflects an approximate 3% increase in our current G&A load plus $10 million for the change in lease accounting.  So combining all of our assumptions together result in our initial guidance range for 2019 funds from operation of $6.75 to $6.92 per share - an increase of $0.44 per share over the midpoint of our 2018 guidance. The primary drivers are projected growth from an increase at the midpoint of $0.40 per share of NOI from our same property portfolio, $0.50 per share from acquisitions and development deliveries and $0.03 per share from other income. These gains are projected to be partially offset by the dilution from $0.33 per share of higher interest expense $0.09 per share of higher G&A expense and $0.07 per share of lost NOI from asset sales also at the midpoint.  At the midpoint of our guidance range, we're projecting 2019 FFO growth of 6.8%. If you adjusted the impact of our asset sales and net of reinvestment and the new lease accounting rule approximately $0.08 a share this growth would have been 8% on a comparable basis.  Again our growth is coming from our share of higher revenues and property NOI, where we're projecting to add $140 million of incremental NOI at the midpoint in 2019. If you incorporate our 2018 projections our NOI is projected to grow over $200 million from 2017 an increase of 14% over two years which includes the dilution from our dispositions. Well we aren't going to give 2020 guidance today. Looking further ahead, we expect 2020 is a benefit from a full year of stabilized income at Salesforce Tower as well as the delivery of an additional $1.5 billion of 2019 and 2020 development deliveries that are 79% preleased. And beyond that, we have another $1.5 billion dollars of developments delivering between 2021 and 2022 that are 82% preleased.  So as you can see, we have a strong pipeline of preleased developments that we expect to drive earnings growth over the next several years. That completes our formal remarks. I appreciate if the operator could open things up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi. Manny Korchman : Sorry about that. Good morning guys. Just thinking about the confidence levels that 399 that's been a project where deals have fallen out seemingly last minute to us maybe not you. What inspires the confidence now to sort of expect that to close where you wanted to now? Doug Linde : So let me just make a quick comment and I'll let John Powers provide more color. The lease that we lost we were surprised at. And we've rarely have ever gotten to a lease execution at 399 Park Avenue where we have had a lease disappear. So I think that is the exception not the rule. Our confidence level from my perspective has to do with the level of negotiation and status of the lease that is being drafted right now. But John, you should comment on your view. Owen Thomas : Hi, it's Owen, I'm just going to jump in I'm not sure where John is. I think I know if John were on the call he'd express what Doug did which is a highly great confidence in us accomplishing the leases that we're currently working on. Manny Korchman : And then just turning to the comments you made on the retail space at GM. Could you elaborate sort of the timing of that lease commencing and what the income levels might be? I know you expressed a big markup to the line up there. Owen Thomas : So I don't feel comfortable talking about what a particular tenant's going to pay, Manny. The rent is already commenced, we've already delivered the space. They are in their build out period right now. There is about a year or plus of free rent associated with that. So we expected that tenant will be actually be physically in occupancy selling goods sometimes in the third quarter or fourth quarter in 2019. And it's a very healthy rent. I would tell you that Madison Avenue rents on the lower portion of Madison and the leasing there has gotten better. And so it's pretty consistent where the rents would have been three or four years ago. Manny Korchman : Thanks guys. John Powers : Hi this is John. Can you hear me now, Owen? Owen Thomas : Yeah we got you John. John Powers : Yeah sorry, I don't know what happened. There is a question on 399. It's really understanding the tenants that you dealing with in the situations where they coming out of and where you are in the process. So I have a very high confidence level that we're going to close the deals that we spoke about. Manny Korchman : Thanks everyone. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Deutsche Bank. Nick Yulico : Hi. Just going to back 399 Park. Can we get, you mentioned that most of the 400,000 square feet of vacancy is going to actually commence by the end of next year. So possible to get what the NOI benefit for that building is going to be from that incremental leasing in 2019? John Powers : So I cannot give you an explicit exact number. I can tell you that the 400,000 square feet of space have a rent of approximately $100 a square foot slightly higher. So that's $40 million. And our view is that more than 50% of it obviously will be commencing in \u2013 we hope could be commencing in 2019 from a revenue recognition perspective. Nick Yulico : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then Owen I just wanted to go back the commentary you gave earlier about how the balance sheet is positioned really well, you don\u2019t need to pursue much in the way of additional assets sales to fund development. And I guess appreciate all that, but at the same time does show there is disconnect between where private market values are and where particularly office REIT stock values are. And so I guess I\u2019m just wondering how you thinking about that and historically you have done the right thing and sold assets as a company, given some capital back to shareholders at times like this. So, how you\u2019re weighing that against what you said there is already a good balance sheet but what might be a right time to prune the portfolio a bit more? Owen Thomas : Yeah. So, a couple of things I would say first of all, in terms of new investments so as I mentioned the development pipeline that we have and the new investments that we\u2019re pursuing we\u2019re targeting a 7% initial cash yield for those and our stock even at the current trading level is more in a mid 5 on a cap rate basis. So, I think the better use of the capital is in development. Then in terms of funding and with asset sales, I mean look we are doing we\u2019re not selling large core assets, but Mike described $370 million of non-core assets that we\u2019re selling this year that clearly helpful in funding our capital needs. In terms of doing, selling some of the larger core assets one, as Doug described we have a lot of confidence in that and they\u2019re performing well a lot of them been reconditioned, have additional amenities, we\u2019re not sure they\u2019re great sales candidates. And then from a financial perspective they all have a significantly lower basis than their market value and so selling them would require a material special dividend and dilution in our FFO per share and resulted growth. So, we don\u2019t anticipate significant core assets sales. And then the other thing I would add is that given where we are in the overall economic cycle and where we are relevant to the questions about volatility, I think we\u2019re taking a more defensive perspective with regard to our overall balance sheet. And so we want to put ourselves in a position where we\u2019re not in a situation where we 'over leverage' ourselves and selling assets and paying out dividends would put more pressure on where our leverage ratios are. Nick Yulico : Okay. Thanks everyone. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Jamie Feldman : Great. Thank you. Just focusing on the guidance for a moment. Mike, just to clarify you have mentioned a couple of potential refinancing and I think at the end you said those were not included in the guidance. Can you just clarify what is and what\u2019s not on the refinancing side? Mike LaBelle : So, what I talked about is that we\u2019re looking at our bond issuances coming having conversions internally about whether try to do something next year with that or not. And there will be prepayment charges associated with doing that and our interest savings next year and that is not in our guidance. We do anticipate that there we\u2019re going to continue to use our line to fund our development outflows that I described. So, I would anticipate that our line we'd be getting to a point where we probably want to term it out sometime in mid 2019. So, that\u2019s within our guidance based upon where we think rates are going to be. Our rate our rate expectations on our line for next year is that LIBOR is going to go up you know four times during the next quarters and that we\u2019ll we will also see long term rates continue to go up so that you know if we're doing a deal in mid 2019 it's going to be at a higher rate than we do today. So we do have some kind of interest you know creep builds up in those projections. Does that help? Jamie Feldman : Sure, so you saying the charge is not in the guidance. What about, then you also mentioned potentially a larger rate at the end of the year. That's not in the number? Mike LaBelle :  I mentioned that we would not a raise, that we would term out any outstandings on our line of credit likely sometime in mid 2019. So it's really just a replacement. Now we're doing a 10 year financing versus what our line is there might be a 50 to a 100 basis point increase in the rate that gets put on that financing in midyear. Jamie Feldman : All right. That's helpful. And then how do you think about based on the guidance the distribution coverage for next year or maybe what AFFO could look like? Mike LaBelle : Well I think the dividend coverage you know we anticipate by you know certainly by mid the end of next year should be basically where it is today. I mean kind of an FAD coverage ratio. I think that you know our tax income will continue to grow throughout the year. So I expect that fourth quarter of this year and first quarter next year it'll be a little bit higher than it is today. But then it'll come back down and improve. And again part of that is you know the asset sale income in 2018 is not included in our FAD it's excluded from our FAD. So the if you includes that our coverage will be very strong in 2018. This is not part we don't include that as part of FAD. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then turning to development and where we are in the cycle just can you get. You talked about you know decent amount of conversations out there and certainly with like the Reston Town Center land just a lot of opportunities where you could keep building. Can you talk about your thoughts on being preleased versus or just kind of what level of preleasing you'd want to see given where we are in the cycle versus the opportunities you're seeing? Owen Thomas : As you know our preleasing requirements have gone up and our significant development pipeline is underway is 85% preleased which we think is terrific. So you know we don't have a specific number. It's dependent on the market and the scale of the building and those types of things. But given your comments about where we might be in the cycle we have been elevating those pre leasing requirements. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then just final question on development. Are you looking at any opportunity zone development potential or potential investments? Owen Thomas : We're studying the program and the locations of the opportunity zones and the specifics of the new regulations that have just come out. But I would suspect that we will not conclude that will be a big opportunity for Boston Property. Jamie Feldman : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Q \u2013 Steve Sakwa : Thanks, good morning. I guess Doug I wanted to pick up on the comment you talked about, about having the portfolio you know largely refresh maybe with the exception of the easy retail. But as you guys sort of think about the types of building tenants want, the lead certification issues you know how do you sort of look at the overall portfolio holistically as you think about obsolescence and you know how much more of the portfolio longer term do you think could be subject to sale? Mike LaBelle : Well I would say the conversation about obsolescence and sale don't necessarily have anything to do with each other. We don't believe that any of our CBD properties having now been respositioned and refreshed are in any type of obsolescence category at all whatsoever. And if you look at the older buildings that we have and the lease commitments that we're getting, I think we feel really good about the positioning that we've done and the market's reaction to those. And that includes I mean the Prudential Tower in Boston was built in 1967 and it's a 100% leased. And we have growing tenants who are moving in from all across the city. And it sort of to speaks to if you do it right you can keep one of these buildings going for a long long time. And I would just comment on Embarcadero Center, that those buildings were built between 1970 and 1980 that we're talking 50 plus years to 40 plus years. And so it's the right time to do the kind of work that we're going to be doing.  I think Owen answered the question relative to what our views on selling assets. And at the moment we don't really have any 'core asset sales' potentially likely in the short to medium term. It doesn't mean that we won't look at that differently if the markets are changing and the valuations are different, but right now it's not part of the conversation. Steve Sakwa : Okay and then secondly on development. I know you've got a very active pipeline and you've also got lots of land. I'm just curious as you sort of look at where do you think the next sort of opportunities may surface. And there has been some stories in the press about you potentially doing a large project in Cambridge. And I know you won't specifically speak to the tenant at hand. But just where do you think the next few opportunities might come up on the development front? Owen Thomas : So the buildings that are in closer conversation on, the first one obviously is in Cambridge. And that's, it's been in the public press that we're talk to any company tenant about expanding the building. Ripping down hundred plus thousand for the building and building a 435,000 square foot building in display. That base station is a real viable location transit oriented development. And it's, we've got our entitlement completed and we're working diligently on those plans. There are other pieces of land in Boston that we are looking at. We would certainly not necessarily start anything on a speculative basis that could be part of the conversation. And I described the potential opportunity we have in San Jose with Transit Oriented development there and there is the Portland Harrison site in San Francisco which again everything were to go right. We may be in a position where we would have permits towards the middle to end of 2019 and be able to deliver a building in 2021 or 2022 and there is sufficient tenant demand there that we feel comfortable that that's a building that that has a legitimate opportunity to get started relatively soon. Steve Sakwa : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel. John Guinee : Great. Couple of miscellaneous questions. First looks like you're going to run 2019 without accessing the equity markets. Mike what's that do to your net debt to EBITDA by year-end? Mike LaBelle : So now our net debt to EBITDA is about 6.7 times. And obviously we've got EBITDA coming in from development where the money is already spent and we've got money going out for development that we've announced or have underway. So my expectation is that our net debt to EBITDA over the next year or so is going to remain in kind of that high-6s kind of area maybe around 7. And then as we deliver this stuff it's going to come down and pro forma for the delivery of the development it would be down substantially from where it is today. So, we feel again our tolerance level rests on a kind of steady state basis is somewhere in the low 7s. So, we still have comfort and room as we look at pro forma for our development to being well below that. So, we feel very good. John Guinee : And then looking at your development management service revenue let's say its $40 million next year. Is that a gross number or a net number said another ways should we look at that as an offset to G&A? Mike LaBelle : No. It\u2019s not an offset to G&A. John Guinee : But, is it a gross number there? Mike LaBelle : Yeah. It\u2019s a gross number. Owen Thomas : It\u2019s a gross number and we use our G&A to fund this. Owen Thomas : Yes. The people are, in our G&A already that are doing that work. John Guinee : Okay. All right. Then two real estate questions, what\u2019s going on at the Napolis Junction that building been sitting there vacant for a couple of years now. And then the second, as I look at your Reston development deals and 17/50 President looks like it\u2019s coming in at about 518 a square foot which isn't surprising, the Reston Gateway looks like it\u2019s coming in at about 670 a foot, which seems a bit high. Owen Thomas : Peter, you want to comment answer the questions on the developments and then you and Ranking talk about Minneapolis junction? Peter Johnston : Sure. Part of that differential John has to do with the fact that the gateway side abuts as Doug indicated, the silver line rail and there are a number of profits and cost associated with that. The other thing as you know in the Town Center, the footprint of the site associated with the 17/50 deal is just basically the curve line, because it\u2019s a urban development whereby if you think about all of the infrastructure and the streetscape that the Town Center has and what will be replicating down there, that\u2019s a much bigger just footprint that has to accommodate and allocate those cost over it. So, that\u2019s the bulk of the differential plus we\u2019re buying the building probably 15 months less or you would normally factor in 3% to 5% escalation in those costs anyway.  As far as and I hope that answer your question. As far as an Napolis Junction building eight I think the one you\u2019re referring too, which we did build with our partners speculatively based on what we hope were contracts coming out hasn\u2019t obviously leased and we actually are touring people through that multiple firms that all competing for the same contract which is pretty typical for that marketplace. So, we\u2019re hopeful that we\u2019re going to be able to strike a deal with somebody in the near future. Owen Thomas : The other thing I want to add on project John again that\u2019s a 50-50 with the goals and I think that the total cost today $24 million something on those lines. So, our total exposure there is $12 million. Mike LaBelle : Well, thank you. It\u2019s actually less rate, the TI dollars have been invested either. It\u2019s just the tail. John Guinee : Got you. Wonderful job. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Blaine Heck : Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to touch on acquisition in LA in particular. It seems like this year has been slower from a transaction volume standpoint in general out there, but there seem to be more deals coming to the market recently, Owen you mentioned Campus at Playa but I'm just wondering if you guys can talk about your comfort with your current footprint out there whether you're pursuing anything out there at this point and whether there are any submarkets outside of Santa Monica that you guys would target in particular. Owen Thomas : I'll start and then turn it over to Ray and John who's also on the phone. The volumes in L.A. have gone down because basically Blackstone worked through their EOP portfolio and they were a big driver of the volumes and I think Santa Monica Business Park is one of their last deals. So I think that's the driver.  That being said there's still plenty things to look at and we're looking at them. You know we've had a big year so far obviously with the Santa Monica purchase. We're thrilled with our footprint. It's very material in Santa Monica and we've had good financial performance particularly Colorado Center which we've owned for several years. You know I think the nature of the deals are you know also different and in some ways more interesting. There's clearly the broadly offered types of deals that we will look at from time to time but they're also you know off market transactions with owners that are also interesting. With that, why don't I it turn it over to Ray or John for additional color? Go ahead John, back to you. John Powers : I want to reiterate what Owen said there that we continue to pursue both the marketed opportunities and the off market opportunities. I think everybody knows that the West Coast has been particularly attractive both for domestic capital and international capital so we're very cognizant of the competition here. But we remain hungry to find the right deals. And with that we're looking in different submarkets outside of Santa Monica across West Los Angeles and across the L.A. MSA. Owen Thomas : But you know realizing we've been in the market for two years. We're now the largest landlord in Santa Monica and we are due to John's effort, reaching out aggressively to off market deals. And what we're trying is employ the same formula in L.A., L.A. we have done in all four markets which is creating value through the development process which is incredibly difficult in L.A. but we're trying hard Blaine Heck : Very helpful. And then maybe sticking with Ray or Doug, we noticed a pretty substantial increase in the office expirations next year in D.C. Looks like another 300,000 to 350,000 square feet added to 19 expirations with a higher rent per square foot. Just wanted to see if we can get any color on whether that was a short term lease or maybe one of the leases you mentioned you pulled forward to 2019. Any detail there would be helpful. Doug Linde : Yes so those are in our J.B. properties on that there are two law firms that are expiring in 901 New York Avenue and Metropolitan Square and those are leases that we've known we're going to be vacating for the better part of two plus years. And so those are, one of them is an 80% JV, where we're the 20% owner that's in that Med Square and then we're a 50/50 partner in 901. So relatively speaking they don't have much of an economic impact. Unidentified Company Representative : That also include Akin Gump -. Unidentified Company Representative : That Doug can say Ray. Go ahead. Doug Linde : Yeah I mean it also includes Akin Gump which is a building we have under contract to sell. So we've already mitigated that issue. Blaine Heck : Got it that's helpful. And then Doug thanks for the color on the drivers of the higher CapEx during the quarter. But that's somewhat backwards looking as that\u2019s commence leases not what's executed so hoping we can get a little bit more color on general trends on the ground with respect to TIs at free rent whether there are any markets you expect further increases or even tight markets that you could see concessions decrease. Owen Thomas : So I tried that I tried to you know sort of sprinkle that in my prepared remarks and I saw I'll just refresh that. So in the Boston marketplace we actually think transaction costs are going to start to moderate meaning you know the TI concessions that we\u2019ve provided a year ago are going to be less in 2019. And there the free rent deminimus. In San Francisco where I would say that we're pretty comfortable that the transaction cost are going to remain flat largely because the positive installation there and this is across the board are going up at such high rates that the tenants are being forced to spend a lot more money so we can get a tenant to agree to move is not a easy decision in in itself. But the rental rates that we're getting at these marketplaces are escalating at such high numbers that we're comfortable with the overall economic package. In New York City, things are very flat. The big TI concessions in the big free rent concessions that were part of the market in 2016 and early 2017 are long gone. Now I would say your concessions are static at call it a $100 to $120 a square foot on a 15 year lease and about a month of free rent with the capital probably 12 to 13 months. And in the Washington DC market, I think that's the weakest market from a concession perspective. I don't think things are going up dramatically. But there are something some other desperation out there with regards to getting some of these larger blocks and space there. And so people are providing $140 to $150 a square foot in improvement allowance in excess of the year plus of free rent. And that's again the weaker the market.  In the suburban market the concessions are significantly lower in a market like Reston we're talking about $5 to $7 a year. And probably a half a month a year free rent in the Boston market, we're talking about concessions probably closer to $5 a square foot at TIs and very little in the way of free rent. And then in the 'Silicon Valley' the concession pattern are diminimus. For project like Mountain View which is a single story, we're talking about providing market ready improvements which are $20 to $25 a square foot. Blaine Heck : Thanks guys. Enjoy the parade. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Alexander Goldfarb : Good morning. Just a few questions for me. First, Mike. Just going back to the guidance and Jamie's question earlier. So would you guys do a bond, early bond refinancing at the end of '18. You said that that instant saving is not in your '19 guidance. But you also mentioned the potential for dispositions next year which I assume would be similar to this year. So nothing large scale but maybe some smaller ones. Is it your view that any interest rate savings would be offset by NOI loss by dispositions or as the dispositions could that disposition loss NOI be a bigger number? Mike LaBelle : Obviously they offset each other as we engage in both activities. So I don't think that the savings in interest expense would likely not be not actually will be I don't think will be as quite as high as the disposition activity is the same as it is this year. So we had similar disposition activity next year and this year. I think it would be there will be a little more dilution from the sales and there is the gain from the interest expense. Although both items, you're not talking about $0.10 to $0.20 you're talking about $0.05 to $0.08 type of numbers I would say. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay that's helpful. And then the second question is on WeWork it's certainly a recurring topic. Recently hired Wendy -- they seem to be bulking up on owning property directly, they've been articles about some landlords doing participation rents. So how do you guys view WeWork as far as your exposure to them and how they're coworking tenants. And are you thinking about launching. I don't know if you have your own coworking platform or not, but how do you view the growth in this base or do you view that more that WeWork type coworking space is going to be more in B and C office rather than the A office? Owen Thomas : Yeah. So, Alex we view, WeWork as an important customer, they're our 16 largest tenant and they currently represent about 0.8% of our income stream. And we would in places that makes sense we would be open to expanding the relationship further. The facts are our portfolio as you\u2019ve been hearing us describe on this call, is getting pretty full and I think there are fewer and fewer opportunities to work with WeWork in and other co-working operators. We are also selectively opening our own types of spaces in handful of situation I might turn it over to Bryan to talk about that. Bryan Koop : Yeah. So, we opened up flex by BXP and the distinction versus co-working is that this product is specifically targeted towards the enterprise user. Let me explain two enterprise users that provide greater clarification because this whole zone is getting misuse of terms. So, an enterprise user for us in our flex by BXP that we\u2019ve already obtained in terms of clients is one the corporate user who has specific project link for a project. The other would be a start-up company that several call it series into their investments and there is still as risk on the length of the term that they would like to have. Those two customers have already proven out to be great customers for us in flex by BXP at the Prudential Center and we announced last week that we\u2019re going to kick off another 40,000 feet in the CBD at the 100 federal. We also think that this is product is really good for our larger towers where you can place this between some of our larger users and as Doug refer to it in the past almost like a shock observer for us for growth for those clients. The length of term can be month-to-month but what we\u2019re finding is that the user and the enterprise zone has been year to two years. The evidence of the size of the enterprise user is already there and as an example within our 14 million square foot portfolio in Boston, we have roughly 101 subleases, of those subleases which really interesting 33 of them are less than two years in length. So, these customers are already been out there and we think there is still a significant opportunity for us to satisfy the needs of those customers and then have it blend really well with our long and strong leases that are such a big and important part of our portfolio. Owen Thomas : So Alex to summarize it all. WeWork is an important customers as I mentioned, we have other co-working operators in several of our buildings and we are as Brian described experimenting with it ourselves in a couple of installation. When you add it all up it\u2019s about 1% of our revenue. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. Thank you, Owen. Thank you, Bryan. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of quick ones. Any update on the lease with Under Armor given some of the recent restructuring plans timing wise and any updates on the lease? Owen Thomas : There are no update on the lease. So, we are as you probably aware here, if you\u2019ve been to New York City recently we\u2019re getting really, really close to delivering the dramatically changed Plaza at 757 Fifth Avenue the General Motors building with the new Apple Cube and the extraordinary store that Apple is doing. In the mean time they have been using the Under Armor space as their temporary store without much in the way of a drop of sales interestingly. Yes and they're going to double the size of the Apple store when the Apple store opens. And we expect that you know in early 2020 we will be delivering the space to Under Armor and we'll start to be able to recognize revenue and they will be in a position to open a store you know based upon whatever their current conception time frames are. Vikram Malhotra : Okay. And then some of your peers have opined that you know rent growth in midtown, you know while it's been under pressure this year. Sector rents have been down now for a year and a half maybe more. They view sort of rents inflecting upwards and over the next six to nine months. I'm wondering if you share that view or is there any nuances or the thoughts you may have on rent growth into next year? Doug Linde : I provided my perspective you know in my comments which what I think things are going to be flat. But I'll let John Powers provide his view that maybe it's slightly different. John Powers : No, it's not very different Doug. We think that the market is pretty flat, we certainly have a lot of velocity here and that's really good. Manhattan overall is going to have a strong year on the velocity side. But availability rate hasn't dropped because we have new supply coming on. So when you balance those two things it's a flat marketplace it's a good marketplace but it's a flat marketplace. Vikram Malhotra : Okay, so flat rents into 2019 and then just last question on your life science portfolio a larger healthcare REIT just transacted a large billion dollar campus. So I'm estimating a low recap just sort of wondering any thoughts on where pricing is for us for your portfolio in the Cambridge area. Doug Linde : So our Cambridge portfolio for the most part is actually office space not lab space. We only have one dedicated lab building in Cambridge and it's only you know 60,000 square feet. The -- I will tell you that we've seen some extraordinary sales life science buildings there's a new building that was just you know purchased in Watertown Massachusetts which is you know it's close to Cambridge but it is not a transit oriented you know facilities anywhere close to it other than bus people stops and it traded for over $900 a square foot. And then there are a couple of buildings in the suburban market in Waltham with a lot significant vacancy that traded or trading in excess of $700 a square foot so there is a very strong life science demand and because of that demand there is an expectation for a significant rental rate growth. And there's a lot of investor demand for it. Vikram Malhotra : Great, thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Q \u2013 Craig Mailman : Hey guys. Doug maybe going back to one of your comments in the prepared remarks sounds a little sarcastic about the shudder to think about rent roll downs and just go given the increase in bumps. But I just wanted to get your thoughts on that market longer term and the ability to push rents in with or get positive mark to market at the end of some of these leases are big escalators if the split roles goes through than what you think that could to do to rent growths in the market. Doug Linde : So I think it's a really interesting question Craig, because the split roll has a you know a economic impact which we can define based upon the contractual leases that we have i.e. if you have a triple net lease it doesn't matter if you have a gross lease its sort of matter then it rolled in over time. Right. But I think you asked the right question which is what point does the pricing get so expensive that these tenants start to change their habits in terms of their real estate which is a fair question.  Relative to other parts of the world the rents in San Francisco still look very cheap including by the way the new construction in Midtown Manhattan. And the profitability of the companies that are leasing a lot of that space are extraordinary. So I am pretty bullish on the vibrancy of the tenant demand that we are seeing in a market like San Francisco and the strength of those companies and their ability to absorb those types of increase. And so it will sort of become part of the marketplace. I think the real question is some of the sort of 'service providers' and the other companies that are not quite as profitable as a Salesforce.com or Amazon.com or a Microsoft, LinkedIn or a Google or potentially AirBnB and Uber. I mean those have different types of companies. And so I do think that there will be a set of companies that will have a different perspective on that. But we're hopeful that first of all this is not going to play out until 2020 to 2021. So there is going to be a lot of conversation a lot of politicking a lot of lobbying that goes on. And we'll have to see sort of see where it all shakes out. Craig Mailman : That's helpful. And then just on the reclassification of the 120,000 square feet at 399 Park. Is that on, could you just give a little bit color about what that was? And is that going to have any effect on kind of rents and building what you guys are trying to lease up? Owen Thomas : So I'll answer that. We do not typically include what we called storage space in our portfolio square footages. And this space, which is at 399 Park was always part of the big Citibank lease that we acquired with the building in 2002. And they use that space for kind of back office cafeteria, payroll and stuff like that. When we got that space back and started looking at what we can lease it for, we determined that we can't lease it anything other than storage space. So we determined the right thing for us to do would be to reclassify it like all of the other storage space that we have in the portfolio which is not in the portfolio square footage. And if we get any rental up we do get rent up our storage space obviously at a discounted rent, it goes into kind of other rental income. So we may be able to lease some of it overtime. And then we maybe able to figure out a way to reutilize it and use it for something totally different some kind of amenity or something like that. I know the team in New York is thinking about those ideas. But that was the driver behind pulling it out in the portfolio and putting it into the storage space which is the -- the same way we handle all of the storage space of the company. Craig Mailman : So it's separate from the 400,000 that you guys have leased. Doug Linde : Yes. Craig Mailman : Okay. And then last one Mike on the midyear kind of size of that bond offering. Should we think kind of in the $700 million range? Mike LaBelle : No, I think that's fair, we have a $1.5 line. So I don't think we want to get it to the point where it's over $1 billion outstanding. Because we start to get to that level it's just kind of limits your ability to do other things potentially that might happen quickly. So my expectation is once we kind of get approaching that level that we would think it's a right time to term it out. And as I mentioned our expectation is that we will have $250 million of development outflows every quarter. So as you kind of think about that, when you get kind of into the mid-third quarter of the year that outstanding is going to start to get up there. So that's our top process. Craig Mailman : Great. Thanks guys. Mike LaBelle : Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Ismail with Green Street Advisors. Daniel Ismail : Hey guys. Just had a few quick ones for me. Can you provide an update on where in place rents sit relative to market for the entire portfolio now? Doug Linde : We have a schedule ask your next question we\u2019ll come back to you. Daniel Ismail : Sure. It sounds like core asset pricing remains pretty stable for office properties so the non core dispositions I mean you guys found similar trends in bidding trends or asset pricing? Mike LaBelle : What was, I\u2019m sorry could you mentioned the preamble again there was some papers rusting I didn't hear it. Daniel Ismail : Sure. No problem. I was asking about in place rents relative to market? Mike LaBelle : So, the first question of, we have our answer, right now on a pure mark-to-market basis the whole portfolio it\u2019s about $6 per square foot or 9% positive. Daniel Ismail : Great. Thanks. And then for the non core asset, non core sales you guys have been doing this year. Have you found our pricing coming in at your original underwriting and how is the appetite for the market for those types of assets? Doug Linde : Yeah. Absolutely, we\u2019ve been getting the pricing that we expected to get when we made the decision to put the asset in the market. That being said, we are selling non core assets which generally means they're in suburban locations or the cap rates are higher than what our core assets we sell for. But, we are and we are generally getting multiple bids and having active processes. Owen Thomas : And the largest one, that we closed was 580 and I think we were slightly above where we expected to be there. And then 1,333 New Hampshire Avenue we exceeded our initial price expectation by a mark-to-market less than 5%. So, pretty consistent to where we thought we would be. Daniel Ismail : And then last one for me, it looks like a cost increase a little bit on Dark 72. Can you explain maybe some of the reasons why and that impacts the economics about the development at all? Owen Thomas : Yeah. It\u2019s really simple, it\u2019s a dry out of the lease up schedule due to just sort of the challenges of the labor and Dark that you see from a construction perspective and the timing associated with getting the building completed. And so we expanded our lease up. Daniel Ismail : Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi. Michael Bilerman : Hi. It\u2019s Michael Bilerman. Just two quick ones, just one on New York just give an update on cost expecting at Hudson Boulevard. And also sort of the prospecting Dark 72 especially given the increased cost and the timing delays you\u2019re talking about from a leasing perspective? Owen Thomas : John, you want to cover that? John Powers : Sure. We have a couple of meetings on 3 Hudson Boulevard. I think the redesigned building has been well received these are long-term discussions with tenants with lease expirations far in the future. And we have another one this week later this week. So, we\u2019re hopeful with that process where we\u2019re still redesigning the building getting our pricing and et cetera. On Dark 72, Doug mentioned that the construction process has been delayed also WeWorks construction process for other reasons has been delayed. So, we expect to open late in the first quarter, next year 2019. We have had a couple of tours, we have a important one this week, we are trading no paper at this time. Michael Bilerman : Okay. How do you feel John about timing on Hudson Boulevard or do you feel more confident of that potentially landing someone? John Powers : Well, I said to a group of analyst that there we would start tenant work, I think between 2022 and 2052. Michael Bilerman : That\u2019s great. John Powers : Comfortable with that range. We have to you know we have find the right tenant or potentially two tenants to start this in this environment. It's a great site, we like the site, we like it's a full acre, avenues on three sides, transportation et cetera. There's other competition right in the neighborhoods as you know with 66 and 50 and also Brookfields building, Manhattan West. So everyone's kicking the tires and now we're in for the meetings. Michael Bilerman : Doug just on Embarcadero retail $80 million at year plan spend. How should we think about the timing of that 80, whether there's any sort of drag from an income perspective. Like there's been that some of these other large repositioning that you've done and then when does the potential upside come as that space gets redelivered. Doug Linde : So I would describe the work that I'm describing as follows. It's not about the retail from a retail income perspective it's about the space on the ground level and on the plaza level at Embarcadero Center to enhance the overall office environment. We are achieving historical rents right now in Embarcadero Center. So in the short term I can tell you that there is absolutely no revenue correlation with what we're doing. But I will tell you that you know we're in a time of plenty and there probably will be times when things will be more challenging and we should do this because it's the right thing for the property and so on a net basis we will we will be able to have higher retention and achieve higher rents in a down market because of the work that we're doing. I don't personally believe it's going to impact this market in sort of the next call it 12 month because it is so strong and it is so hot and rents have moved up so fast and there's so little space. Tenants will almost do take any space they can. I mean it's that tight in San Francisco. Michael Bilerman : Sorry for taking the call longer but I'm pretty sure I heard Yankees Suck a few times in the background. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Q \u2013 John Kim : Thank you. Apple entered your top 20 list, the first tenant. Does this represent the new lease that there taking space that the GM building or is that the temporary space and can you also remind us when that impacts your cash same-store result? Owen Thomas : It represents some increases that we have gotten in the existing lease and we expect them to vacate that premises sometime first quarter or second quarter, early second quarter next year and move into the new premises and the total contribution that they will provide will actually go down slightly when they do that. So that may change their position in the top 20 at that point but because the project is taken a little bit longer, we had provisions in the lease where we got increases in rents as the redevelopment of the existing store took longer.  And we are now obtaining those in their cash rents that we're getting today. Q \u2013 John Kim :  Okay, and Mike can you just explain once again the termination income increase for next year. It sounds like it's just an allocation of rents rather than a tenants' determination fee. Mike LaBelle : Yeah, we don't include termination income in our same store. We've never done that because it's lumpy and it hasn't the impact you know the next year in the same year. So we pull it out. So in these situations where we've got three relatively large ones that will work on the portfolio where we wanted move a tenant out that doesn't want all the states necessary. But we have another client that wants it. So we are in a good position where we can negotiate a termination payment that is attractive to us covers all of our kind of downtime and cost. And bring the new tenant in. So it has an impact on our same property and then basically just moves that income from the same property pool to the termination income pool. So I wanted to describe it because if you look at our overall guidance increase you have to have the same store pool plus the termination income in there. John Kim : One last if I may. Doug Linde : Yes. John Kim : One last one if I may. The 19% dividend increase. Was that purely based on your taxable income growth or was it partially influenced by the movement tenure? Mike LaBelle : So we talked about this I guess when we did the dividend increase. For 2018, the gains on asset sales the tax gains on the asset sales are driving our taxable income higher. As we look at 2019, our taxable income is increasing because of operating cash flow going up. So we felt that appropriate rather than doing a special dividend to cover the tax gains on the sales from on the asset sales that we would do a regular dividend in the third quarter of 2018 and feel confident that our cash flow and our taxable operating income which is growing is going to be there in 2019. So we've kind of would done it anyway in effect that's the way we kind of look at it. Owen Thomas : Yeah dividend increase is driven by internal factors, net income, not external factors like interest rate. Mike LaBelle : Yeah. That's all about our taxable income and how much we have to pay out. John Kim : That make sense. Thank you. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. Owen Thomas : Okay terrific. That concludes all the questions. Thank you for your interest in Boston Properties. We'll see many of you at Nareit next week. And we're going to go hit the parade. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks. Owen Thomas : Thank you, Sara, and good morning everyone. We just completed another strong quarter capping off one of the most productive and successful years in Boston Properties' history. Specifically, in 2018, we completed 7.2 million square feet of leasing, our second highest level of annual leasing ever. We delivered and placed in service 2.3 million square feet of new developments, the commercial component of which is a 100% lease. We commenced 2 million square feet of new developments, which are 80% preleased in the aggregate with strong customers such as Verizon, Fannie Mae and Leidos as anchor tenants. We completed important new acquisition joint venture including Santa Monica Business Park, doubling our Los Angeles presence, and a site at 3 Hudson Boulevard in New York that can accommodate 2 million square feet of new development. We completed approximately 720 million of non-core asset sales. We increased in-service portfolio occupancy, 70 basis points over the years to 91.4%. And lastly, we increased our regular quarterly dividend 19%. In fact Boston Properties has increased its regular quarterly dividend by more than 46% over the past three years. And more recently in the fourth quarter of 2018, we generated FFO per share in line with prior guidance, and up 7% year-over-year. We leased 1.8 million square feet including of 300,000 square-foot leased with Millennium Management at 399 Park, bringing this focus asset to 93% leased. We raised $1 billion as the green bond in the unsecured debt market on favorable terms, and we increased the midpoint of our FFO per share guidance for 2019 by $0.11, raising our projected 2019 growth to over 10% at the midpoint. Our performance in 2018 highlights the key characteristics that make Boston Properties unique and its ability to generate growth and shareholder returns in the office sector. Our high quality Class A assets allow us to attract premium rents from long-term creditworthy tenants. Our scale and diverse yet concentrated market selection allows us to benefit from growth within the strongest markets in the U.S., while minimizing risk of single market sector or customer weakness. Our development expertise and portfolio of sites gives us the opportunity to win important mandates with customers and ensure our growth is driven by a strong pipeline of preleased development, driving higher return. And our modest leverage and growing portfolio NOI provides capacity for new investment without issuing public equity, also driving FFO growth. I'm very proud of our team at Boston Properties and what we are able to accomplish in 2018 through our experience, relationships, teamwork and commitment to success. Now let's turn to the market environment, which has become increasingly dynamic and trends impacting our business. Economic growth in the U.S. and worldwide, hit an inflection point in the fourth quarter. Global and U.S. GDP growth is slowing and elevated trade tensions as well as government dysfunctions given the recent U.S. shutdown and Brexit will have a further negative impact, so called globalization is taking hold and possibly accelerating. As a result, central banks including the Fed in December and January shifted to a much more dovish tone on interest rates and quantitative tightening. As a result, 10-year U.S. treasuries now at around 2.7% which is about 50 basis points below its high in early November. So what does all this mean for Boston Properties? First, we're not overly concerned about the near-term recession and expect slowing U.S. economic growth to plateau and stabilize above 2% at least for now. Second, our long stated view and interest rate risks are overblown has proven true and given the recent Fed rhetoric, we certainly expect rates to stay low for the foreseeable future, a significant positive for real estate value. Lastly, we see no current signs of abatements in mostly robust leasing markets we have enjoyed. So, we recognize leasing activity lags economic growth and financial market movements and therefore risks of slowing leasing activity or higher. We remain constructive on further investing activity given economic growth and low interest rates. That said, we have adjusted our risk thresholds and we will be increasingly discerning our new acquisitions of launching new development. We continue to believe investment in new developments is more accretive to shareholders and repurchasing our shares, and we will continue to use private equity capital to help fund new investments in order to avoid either issuing public equity at our current share price or materially increasing our leverage. In the private real estate market, significant office building transaction volumes increased to 24% in the fourth quarter and 4% for all of '18. Though investors are increasingly selective there were multiple significant office transactions completed again at sub 5% cap rates in the fourth quarter of last year. Examples include here in Boston in the Financial District 53 States Street sold for $685 a foot and a 4.6 cap rate to domestic operator with U.S. and non-U.S. capital. This was a 1.2 million square-foot building that was or is 94% leased. In Beverly Hills, UTA Plaza and Ice House sold for $954 a foot and a 4.6% cap rate. This is a 240,000 square-foot property and fully leased and sold to a domestic opportunity fund. In New York, 425 Lexington Avenue located near Grand Central sold for $940 a foot and a 4.5% cap rate to a domestic real estate firm. This is a 750,000 square-foot building and is 95% leased. In Mountain View, California Shoreline Technology Center sold for $1 billion or $1,250 a square foot and a 3.5% cap rate to a user that occupied 92% of the building. This is a 12 building 52 acre site is 800,000 square feet and is fully leased. In San Francisco, the 110,000 square-foot 100% leased 345 Brannan Building sold for $1,326 a foot and a high 4s cap rates to a domestic REIT. And finally in Washington DC, 1111 Pennsylvania Avenue sold for $1,032 a foot and 5% cap rate to a domestic investment manager. This building is about 340,000 feet and is fully leased. Now moving to our capital activities, as mentioned, development continues to be our primary strategy for creating value and we remain active pursuing both new preleased projects and sites for future projects. Since our last earnings call, we progressed further our development pipeline activities. With the recent deliveries into service of the Salesforce Tower and Spring Street, our current development and redevelopment pipeline stands at 11 office and residential projects comprising 5.3 million square feet and 2.7 billion of investment for our share, most of the projects are well underway and we have $1.6 billion remaining to find. The commercial component of this portfolio is 78% preleased and the aggregate projected cash yields are estimated to be approximately 7% upon stabilization. Also in 2019, we expect to commence the development of 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington DC and 325 Main Street in Cambridge. These projects aggregate 870,000 square feet, $760 million in new investments and are 75% preleased. We also completed three new acquisitions. In San Jose, we ground lease with the right to purchase next year Platform 16, a site with the potential for 1.1 million square feet of new office development. The purchase right is for approximately a $125 per square foot for the site which is located within walking distance of Diridon Station, San Jose\u2019s primary transportation hub with active Caltrain, BART, and future high-speed rail and adjacent to Google's plant 8 million square foot transit village. Large scale transit oriented site in the Silicon Valley are in high demand and rare. We are also in discussions with capital partners to make a significant investment in this site and the eventual vertical development. More recently in January, we exercised an expiring purchase option for all the remaining development land at Carnegie Center, which can support up to 1.7 million square feet of future development for $42.9 million. So growth in the Princeton market is modest, we have uses for a portion of the property and believe our Carnegie Center asset is more valuable with the existing buildings and development opportunity unified. Also this month, we committed to purchase Heinz's 5% interest net of our advances in Salesforce Tower and settled their carried interest arrangement. Lastly, on capital activities, we have an extremely successful year for disposition, selling $720 million of non-core assets and exceeding our $300 million goal for the year. In the fourth quarter, we completed the sale of 1333 in Hampshire Avenue in Washington DC for a $142 million. We call this asset will be vacated by Akin Gump in 2019 and in is as releasing of the building doesn't fit our current operating strategy. We presold the TSA Development project in Springfield Virginia for $98 million, which is a reimbursement of cost today including our land. If you include the future funding assumed by the buyer, the total sale price is $324 million including development fees to Boston Properties and the forward cap rate is approximately 6%. Given this is a GSA leased asset with flat rents in a suburban location, we would have sold the asset at completion and elected to do it early to free-up capital for our growing development investment. We completed the transfer of our 50% interest in Annapolis Junction One, a 118,000 square foot property located in suburban Maryland to our JV partner in the property. It is our intention to exit the remaining assets we hold in Annapolis Junction overtime. And we fully exited our investment in Tower Oaks preserve business Park in Rockville Maryland by completing in December the sale of a 41 acre parcel of land for $46 million and in January the sale of 26 Tower Oaks, a 179,000 square foot building for $22.7 million or a $127 of square foot. In summary, 2018 was a very successful year for Boston Properties. Given our robust development pipeline and lease-up activity for in-service and assets and like our home town favorite New England Patriots, we\u2019re well positioned to put more wins on the board in 2019 and beyond. Let me turn the call over to Doug. Doug Linde : Thanks, Owen. Good morning everybody. Go back, we had great leasing success in 2018 including the four leases from major new developments that Owen described and our development delivery income continues to accelerate, and it is certainly true there is a barometer of real time economic activity, looking at our revenue from the office leasing business, really a lagging indicator, given the lead times inherent in our transaction cycle. It is also true that the decisions made by our customers a year ago or two years ago or even five years ago are just starting to be seen in our top line revenue and they are contractual and growing for years to come. So, let\u2019s have a case in point at Salesforce Tower. We signed our first lease in April of 2014 and the building won't achieve its all occupied rent revenue run rate until October of this year. Starting at that point, the contractual cash rent increases on average 2 plus percent per year. The first lease exploration in the building and it's only about 70,000 square feet is 2027, and based on the last few deals and inferior buildings in the market in '18, the rent on that particular lease is somewhere between 35% and 40% below markets today. As Owen despite the macroeconomic volatility leasing activity feels a lot like 2018. Our primary customer large real-estate users either public or private start ups are established continue to make decision the upgrade and consolidators space and in some cases it's been. While we continue to see the bulk of office demands growth from the technology and the life science businesses, and flexible space operators there is also robust demand for new space do not necessarily growth space from traditional industries, as evidenced by the incredible activity in Manhattan in 2018. So let's talk about the markets. Our expectations and what's going on in our portfolio. I'm going to begin with New York City. In October 2017, at our investor conference, I stated that our biggest opportunities were higher contribution occupancy improvements in 2019 and 2020 would emanate from 1590 E 53rd Street and 399 Park Avenue and I put John Powers, Andrew Levin and Heather Kahn on the spot. We announced the 30-year lease for all the space at 159 earlier this year with cash rent and hopefully revenue recognition at the end of '19. And then during the fourth quarter and the first week of '19, we've signed leases totaling 554,000 square feet at 399 Park Avenue. These transaction include the leasing in the entirety of the low rise vacancy, the block of space were in 7, 8, 9 and 10 to 252,000 square feet and is part of the same transactions, we agreed to recapture 57,000 square feet on the sixth floor, which is expiring in 2020 and leases for the same tenants. On floors 33 through 35, we need to recapture 73,000 square feet, which is expiring in 2021 and we re-let that entire space to new tenants that's going to stay through 2035 or longer. And finally, we recaptured 97,000 square feet expiring in 2026 on the fourth floor and we released 75,000 square feet along with the our renewal of the 97,000 square feet on the fifth floor through 2037. So we've leased 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, the entire lower rise of the building. We've surpassed our revenue expectations for 2019 and 2020 from the vacant place and we still have 97,000 square feet, the block of space from 18 to 21 available and ready to lease immediately. The expiring gross rent on the 554,000 square feet that I just described was $82 a square foot and the first year rent is about $90 a square foot. There have been a number of recent market causing reports on New York City, and it was quite clear that 2018, was a banner year from activity perspective. The point I would make are as follows : On the margins, there has been a lot of new construction delivered or soon to deliver and the overall availability rate has actually helped steady. And it's actually gone down slightly in Midtown. The addition of new construction underway at 425 Park in One Vanderbilt, 50 Hudson and 6600 Boulevard and the repositioning of buildings like 550 Madison all have acting rents above a $100 a square foot and a $100 plus acting rents are prevalent all over Midtown South. So the inventory of high end space has increased significantly. There was over 4 million square feet of leasing over $100 a square foot last year including renewals in Manhattan in a total market activity of about 38 million square feet. 85% of the deals above $100 a square foot were under 50,000 square feet and averaged around 15,000 square feet. The leasing activity drops dramatically above a $120 a square foot. Overall, we continue to see concessions the free rent build out time in TIs remain very constant and slight uptick in rents in those buildings or submarkets that have gotten tighter. Moving to Washington DC, it continues to be the most challenging market conditions amongst our regions. As you read in our press release and heard from Owen, we have reduced our portfolio exposure in both the CBD and suburban DC market through asset sales. Our new activities are focused on the long-term leases we have signed that will commence with the delivery of our new development between 2020 and 2023. In the CBD, there are lot of new partially leased deliveries and relatively little new demand outside the flexible office providers that actually absorb over 800,000 square feet in 2018. Based on our experience and that's where we have one of these providers, their customers are small entities and operators that are truly aggregating demand that we could never accommodate. This has been a really good thing. With base rent on leases that are stable it's all about concessions and rent commencement days. We have and we will continue to use our operating skills and relationships to gain occupancy at market terms and we will do as many 4000, 20,000, 50,000 square feet deals as necessary to feel our availability in the CBD. The Washington DC region makes up about 17.8% of our total company NOI, down from 21% in 2015 with the CBD at just over 7% of our total NOI so relatively speaking a small portion of the Company's assets. The Northern Virginia portfolio comprises over 53% although regional contribution is growing and has much better leasing activity due to the more diverse demand days which contains a significant number of government contractors, technology companies and other corporate users. We have a number of renewal discussions underway including our 492,000 square feet at the New Dominion, which is leased to the GSA as well as the 275,000 square feet tenants in Reston Town Center. In 2019 and 2020, we will have exposure on our Reston portfolio, as Leidos relocates from their 170,000 square-foot accommodation into the new 270,000 square-foot premises at 1750 and tenants who growth, we were not able to accommodate in 2017 and 2018, we just didn't have the space start to lease. We are in active discussions with two existing tenants. They are looking to expand their 50,000 square-foot installations to new tenants looking for a minimum of 75,000 square feet of piece and a whole host of 7,000 to 10,000 square-foot users that are focused on our amenity rich environment. We will be rolling out a number of place making enhancements during 2019 to our Town Center assets as we get ready for the addition of Metro in our Reston price redevelopment which will open in 2022. Moving West, in LA, we brought Colorado Center to 100% leased and with our limited availability at the Santa Monica Business Park we are focused on early renewals at both properties. With the expected relocation of HBO in December of '20, we have the ability to accommodate the growth of other tenants at Colorado center. And at the Santa Monica Business Park, we are working on getting ahead of our 2020 expirations. The West LA market had an active 2018 beginning of 2019 as a number of large technology companies expanded their footprint in the area. This included Google and Facebook and Apple and Amazon, the same name that you hear by the Silicon Valley as well as a number of flexible office operators including new work and spaces and industrial. Rental rates continue to rise and there are limited big walk availabilities in the West LA market. The story in San Francisco CBD is lack of availability. The vacancy rates are at its lowest levels since the last cycle began after the great financial crisis. There are virtually no direct or somewhat space in the market over a 100,000 square feet other than 50 deals. The only new construction the first admission development won\u2019t deliver until 2023 at the earliest. We understand there is a leasing negotiation for all over the 255,000 square feet at 633 wholesome the only large addition flat major renovation undergoing the city right now. A technology company just leased a 150,000 square feet at One Maritime adjacent to Embarcadero Center and the majority of Salesforce Sublet when they moved into our building at Saleforce Tower has been leased. This Central SoMa plan is under a sequel litigation and will likely delay the ability to commence construction even if the Planning Commission grants the particular site entitlements and allots a plot and allocation. There continues to be significant demand in the market. Since 2011, more than 50% of the annual leasing has come from the technology companies and the total occupied base of the market has move from 22% tech and 2013 about 15 million square feet to more 37% in \u201918 or 30 million square feet, so with double almost more than we could possibly have imagine. In our portfolio, Salesforce Tower, 535 Mission, 680 and 690 Folsom, 50 Hawthorne are all 100% leased. And Embarcadero Center, we ended the quarter at 91.4% and completed 258,000 square feet of leasing within existing rent in place of $61 a square foot growth and new starting rent of $85 a square foot up 40%. The lease commencement to run from February 19 through July of 2020, when a new tenants take those action of the 125,000 square feet of EC3 when the existing tenant than vacant. If you include all the space that is either leased but not yet occupied of our office occupancy, it would jump to 95%. And we currently have another 250,000 square foot under negotiation that could be completed during the first quarter of 2019. If you want a floor space at Embarcadero Center, you\u2019ll probably have to wait until the next delivery of available space in November 30, 2019 when our next full floor not under negotiation expires, a long time. Last but not least, all three of our Boston markets, the CBC, Cambridge and Waltham Lexington continue to be the beneficiaries of ongoing growth in the technology and the life science sectors along with the very manageable new construction. The new buildings that have been started have been size to the market with a very little aggregate speculative space. Our 100 Causeway Way project which is expect to open in \u201921 is a great example. We announced the start of 640,000 square foot tower with a 437,000 square foot commence. An existing tenant at the Podium building at 100 Causeway Way picked up 66,000 square feet for expansion and we\u2019re negotiating lease for the final 125,000 square feet. In Waltham, we started a 211,000 square foot building at City Point with a 110,000 square foot lease and have since leased another 121,000 square feet and have 75,000 square feet remaining. In the last few months, there were additional growth announcements in all of our Boston markets. In Cambridge a life science company committed to a 900,000 square-foot new series of building, and we signed our 365,000 square foot release for three 325 Maine, which we hope to start construction during the second quarter of this year. In Waltham, the only significant speculative office development during this cycle has activity that will bring its occupancy to 75%. And in Boston's Financial District, last week State Street Bank committed to be lead tenants in the 500,000 square feet of space at One Congress. And the remaining 0.5 million square feet in that project and the backfill of their existing location at One Lincoln should be satisfied by other demands. The challenges we have in our Boston portfolio is not just similar at Embarcadero San Francisco lack of space. So, we are focused on future explorations. In late '17, our tenant at 33 Hayden Ave in Lexington 81,000 square-foot has with a 2019 December exploration made the decision to relocate into Boston. During the first week in January, we terminated their lease, and signed a lease for all of the states with the life science company that will take occupancy at the end of this year with a 94% increase in the rent. At 111 Huntington Avenue, we leased two floors one expiring in December 2020 and the other expiring in December of 2021 with an increase of 37% to a growing tenant in that building. And to give you a sense of the changes in market rents. At 200 Clarendon Street, we leased a 30,000 square-foot full floor for a short-term about a 1.5 year in the middle of 2017, that space became vacant in August of 2018. Late last year, we've negotiated a similar term lease at a 12% increased in rent as it is based. Rents in Boston, Cambridge and Lexington had strong increases in 2018, along with a decline in concessions and we expect the same in '19. So as I stated at the outset, at this moment, the conditions across our entire portfolio feel very much the way they did in 2018. And I'll stop there and let the call go to Mike. Mike LaBelle : Great, thank you, Doug. Good morning. As I always said, we end at -- we had another strong quarter in the fourth quarter. Once again, our portfolio of revenues increased sequentially just over to 4% over last quarter and 7% year-over-year. We also grew our share of same property NOI by 3.4% on a GAAP basis and 7.9% on a cash basis over the same quarter last year. And net rents on our second generation leases that commenced this quarter were up over 11% over the expiring lease, all of these are positive trends. Our occupancy climbed to 92.1%, which is a 100 basis point higher than last quarter, if you exclude the delivery of Salesforce Tower. We brought Salesforce Tower into the in-service portfolio this quarter at 70% occupancy which dampened our overall occupancy to 91.4%. Salesforce Tower is a 100% leased, and we expect all of the office tenants will be in occupancy by the end of the third quarter of 2019. We issued a $1 billion green bond with a 4.5% coupon in the quarter and use the portion of the proceeds to redeem $700 million of high coupon 5.78% bond that were due to expire in late 2019. We booked the loss on debt extinguishment of $16.5 million or $0.10 per share, which was primarily the yield maintenance penalty for paying off the bonds early. This charge was included in our adjusted guidance issued in December. We are now taking care of all of our material debt, maturities through late 2020. We reported fourth quarter funds from operations of the $1.59 per share and full year funds from operations at $6.30 per share, which was in line with our guidance. Portfolio revenues and management service fee income were both slightly ahead of our plans but they were offset by higher than projected G&A expense of approximately $0.01 per share. As Owen and Doug described we had a fantastic year of leasing and the fourth quarter was no exception. We signed over 1.8 million square feet in the quarter, including 750,000 square feet in mid town Manhattan. The vast majority of these leases had no impact on the fourth quarter earnings results, but they will have a positive impact on 2019 and beyond. In addition to the significant leasing activity in New York City, we also have strong activity in San Francisco and Boston both for new leases on vacant space, as well as the large number of early renewals for leases expiring between 2019 and 2021 where we expect to get increases in rents. Based on the continued leasing velocity we are increasing our assumption for year-over-year growth and our share of 2019 GAAP same property NOI by 75 basis points at the midpoint to 4.5% to 6% over 2018. We are keeping our cash same property growth assumption at 4.5% to 6.5% as many of the deals we are tracking are early renewals or new leases that will not commence cash rent until late in 2019 or 2020. As a result, we have also increased our assumptions for 2019 straight-line rents by $10 million to $85 million to $110 million. In our non-same property portfolio we are moderating our assumption for the incremental NOI growth in 2019 slightly but $5 million at the midpoint of our range due to minor changes in occupancy timing in our development portfolio. This is comprised of pushing back occupancy by a month or two for some of our office users, as well as the retail space at the hub on Causeway based upon adjusted build out schedule. Generally, our clients are in control of their build out and pay rent on a fixed date. However, we cannot recognize revenue until they complete their work which is not in our control. We are often able to pick up the difference by continuing to capitalized interest, which you will see in our interest expense assumptions. We've increased our assumptions for development and management services income to $40 million to $45 million for the full year an increase of $3 million at the midpoint from last quarter's guidance. The most significant change this quarter came from our sale of the TSA headquarters development. We've entered into a development agreement with the buyer and we earned fees for our development services over the next two years. And lastly, we are reducing our interest expense assumption by approximately $8 million in 2019. We now expect net interest expense to total between $410 million and $425 million for the full year. The reduced expense assumption is from a combination of the new bond deal and bond redemption transactions in December and a reduction in our projected line of credit usage, primarily due to the sale of our TSA development. Our capitalized interest projections have remained steady with the last capitalized interest for the TSA development offset by higher capitalized interest for our other developments. So overall, we are increasing our guidance for 2019 funds from operations by $0.11 per share at the midpoint to a new range of $6.88 to $7 per share. The increase is comprised of $0.7 per share from higher same property portfolio NOI, $0.5 per share of lower interest expense, $0.2 per share of higher fee income offset by a reduction of $0.3 per share of NOI from our developments. Our guidance does not include any additional acquisitions or dispositions, other than what we included in our press release. We are continuing to see positive trends in our markets, resulting in leasing successes that are driving up our organic growth. Additionally, our development pipeline is well leased and provides assured external growth over the next several years. This combination of both internal and external growth points to very strong FFO growth at our midpoint for 2019 of over 10% from 2018. Operator that completes our formal remarks, if you can turn it over to Q&A that would be great. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi. Manny Korchman : Just focusing on New York for a second, if you think about Brookfields announcements that goes back at 2 Hudson Yards. Just wondering if that curtails anything about your 3 Hudson developments whether it'd be your desire to go spec or wait for tenants to come in or if there is any shift in timing for that development? Doug Linde : So, I'll make a brief comment and join in John Powers, I'm assuming you're on and you can you can add on. So at the moment with the two developments at the Hudson Yards, there is -- in one building, there\u2019s just over 1.5 million square feet and the other building just over 1.2 million square feet of available place. And if the announcement that you saw yesterday, it's actually true that the Brookfields tends to start on spec that's another 2 million square feet. So, that's 4 million square feet right there. And then obviously, you have other buildings in Midtown Manhattan that are under construction. I think that we would certainly be looking to have a significant amount of preleasing before we started. John? John Powers : Well, Doug's giving you the facts there. On our situation, we've been working hard since we closed the deal with Joe to redesign the building and we've done that. We're in a 100% BDs now. The construction is ongoing on the foundations and we're talking to some tenants in the market, but clearly we need a significant interest from tenants to move forward with the project. We're very excited with the redesign by the way and it's been very well received by the tenants that we showed it to. Manny Korchman : The other question I was just looking at sort of new markets and new submarkets you're looking at. Is there anything else out there that you're actively tracking that you could share with us right now. Owen Thomas : Manny, it's Owen, good morning. Nothing outside the perimeter that we've described. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Market. John Kim : I wanted to ask on some of the components of your guidance change this quarter from last quarter which includes the higher occupancy assumption. What was that primarily due to? And also if you could talk about the termination fee where this was coming from and how likely it is you are going to release the space? Owen Thomas : So, the guidance change is obviously we increased our guidance last quarter and we also announced I guess earlier this month that we signed a bunch of leases that Doug spoke of in New York City which is over 550000 square feet. We were working on some of those leases last quarter, but they clearly weren't complete. So, we were certainly handicapping the likelihood of those things. And I would say, the execution of those leases some of which are starting you know revenue although not cash revenue in the first and second quarter brought up the drive up the bottom line of our guidance because we got those things. I would say that with a continued velocity of activity that we're seeing in our markets is driving up the high end in the overall guidance range. So those are really the two pieces that are on that are hitting occupancy the increase in the occupancy and the increase in guidance range. Obviously a little bit also came from interest expense as I mentioned. On the terminations, Doug really spoke about the recaptures both in Boston, suburban Boston, he mentioned one and in New York. So we're recapturing space that is expiring, a year from now or even five years from now, and we are getting termination payments that will that are driving our termination income guidance in 2019, which is higher than 2018, but were doing that because we have leases that are signed. So, there may be some interruption in cash rent while that tenant builds out their space, but ultimately what we're doing is we're signing leases now and based and very strong market at strong rental rates that are much higher than the expiring rental rate because we think that we want to take advantage of the market condition we're in. John Kim : And then if I can ask on the sale of the TSA developments and the impairment that you took as part of that sale. Is your view that the market value of this asset will not exceed the cost? And if that's the case, what's really changed since you out of growth of development? Owen Thomas : So, there's a, I would say a lot of financial counting minutiae that's involved in how we recorded the sale of the TSA development. I would just point out two things. One is that we are guaranteeing completion and we are also entitled to any savings under the contingency line item in the budget, as well as we are getting significant development fees when you include those things along with clinical with our land cost was. This was a profitable development for us from a valuation creation perspective. And that counting just let us to having to report as the way it was reported. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Craig Mailman : Owen, just going back to your commentary about being a little bit more cautious on how you guys are looking at developments other than kind of higher preleasing targets potentially on some of these. Are you guys changing at all your yield requirements or any other underwriting kind of items? Owen Thomas : Yes, I wouldn't say that we changed our yield requirements I had pointed to you in fact, the reference rate the 10 year U.S. treasury drop 50 basis points in the last few months. So by keeping our yields flat in essence we increased profit. But I think the answer to your question has a couple of things. One, as you suggest, you know what kinds of preleasing are we going to require for new developments, and I know everyone wants us to give a precise number on that question and that's not really feasible or possible given that all circumstances are different depending on the scale of the building and the economics, and the velocity in the market, and all that type of thing. But yes, I do think we will today seek to have even more preleasing before we launch new developments, and also I think it's being disciplined and looking at new acquisitions of both buildings and sites I mean for example, recently we were chasing a site that we were interested in here in the Boston region and we topped out, at a particular value and at least based on the knowledge that we have today, we are not going to win that. So that would be an example of the increase disciplined that I described. Doug Linde : Yes, Craig, I think in big picture our underwriting criteria have just gotten a little bit more stringent or you thought you might lease up space quickly by elongated where you think you are going to be able to have to provide an improvement allowances or get rental rate increases you might temper those expectations. And so it just all adds into the formula and so it just makes it a little bit more difficult to go after something that we otherwise might have been more aggressive on a year ago. Craig Mailman : And then on Platform 16 just some clarifying points. On the purchase option of 125 bucks a foot, is that on the buildable 1.1 million? Or is that kind of land that they are\u2026 Owen Thomas : Yes, that\u2019s on the buildable. Craig Mailman : So you guys are looking for all like 137 million potentially on that. And then are you guys the way the co-development is going with a partner are they kind of doing the non-office and you guys are doing all the spend on the office? Or could you just give us a little more color on how that works? Doug Linde : So this is pure office development, and the group that put it together is staying involved in the development component, and we are the principal capital partner and we will ultimately own 100% of the asset. All being said as Owen described, we are in serious discussions with a capital partner to participate in our interest on a long-term basis. Craig Mailman : Have you guys had discussions with tenants? Or your discussions about higher preleasing with this project given the adjacency to Google and everything going on in San Jose kind of require less in your view to go forward or how are you guys thinking about it? Doug Linde : So let me just answer the question in the following way and then I'll let Bob talk about leasing conversations. So, the property is an assemblage site and we are literally as we speak I believe, doing surveying work and within expectation that we are going to demolish all the existing structures, do all the relocation of utilities and what we refer to is the enabling work that\u2019s all going to go on over the next six plus or minus months. Then this is a structure of a series of buildings and they all sit on top of a subterranean parking structure. And we will then make a decision as to when we want to start that subterranean parking structure and how we would phase. And this is a feasible project. And so, you know no different than when we started our conversations about Salesforce Tower back in 2013. We are moving forward. We are excited about the project and we are hopeful that leasing markets will provide us with a tenant or tenants well in anticipation of our commencing instructions but you never know. So Bob do you want to just comment on the leasing activity? Bob Pester : Yes, we had discussions with tenants and we plan to talk to other tenants. I think the important thing to point on the site is it's the only transit oriented site between San Francisco and San Jose that will have both Caltrain and BART access. BART has actually just started construction this past week where you can provide up to 1 million square feet at a location. Jordan Sadler : Hey, Doug, it's Jordan Sadler. One other quick one for you, if I could. Your cadence on the New York City in the prepared remarks seemed pretty positive particularly given the asking rents on new development. Do you expect New York to see an improvement and net effectives in '19? Doug Linde : We certainly think that net effective rents are not going down and that there will be modest increases in the rental rates and the concession packages will have half blackout. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Blaine Heck : As you guys mentioned, these are some turbulent times with respect to what\u2019s going in DC, given that the government is your second largest tenant, I was just hoping you guys could touch on any specific areas within your portfolio? Do you think could see some disruption because of the shut down and also if you could touch on any possible effect on Fannie Mae as you guys move ahead with their 850,000 square foot build to suit in Reston? Owen Thomas : Ray or Peter do you want to take that. Ray Ritchey : Well, I\u2019ll start and Peter can jump on. First of all as relates to GSA, one of the great things about leases there, they are long and strong and not related to annual appropriations. So, we have seen actually no change in the current GSA structure as relates to our existing leases. We have a major lease expiring here in a few months and we feel very, very confident about the renewal there. As it relates to Fannie Mae, it remains one of the most profitable entities in the Unites States government. So, we are very much positive about the outcome of the development. They\u2019re still keeping all those space. They have the option to take more. They\u2019ll be in our conference room today just to talk about the status of the construction, and we\u2019ll force them ahead, doing very good about the NMA. Peter Johnston : Yes, I\u2019d also jump in. The deal that was referenced earlier in the call at New Dominion is actually what the government agencies that's already exercised their independent leasing authority, and it happens to also be a mission critical location for the government and the buildings are at the highest level of security that\u2019s provided would be almost impossible to replicate in any kind of reasonable timeframe. So in that regard, we feel very good about the near term exposure. Ray Ritchey : And we have also mitigated our exposure with the sale of 580 and the presale of GSA. So, our exposure to the government is much less than it was even three or four months ago. Blaine Heck : And then maybe, Mike, can you just touch on the Salesforce buyout? How was the 187 million calculated? Or maybe how is that allocated between the buyout of the 5% interest in the property? And any promotes that were paid? And how does that bio affect the yield on your total investment in the property? Mike LaBelle : So, Blaine, this is going to be really unsatisfying answer, but we\u2019re in discussions with the City Assessor right now and it's just not appropriate to discuss how the valuation was done and what it was, how all of those sort of elements were figured out, we just can\u2019t talk about. Blaine Heck : Lastly, noticeably, the estimated total investment on 159 East 53rd increased quite a bit from 106 million last quarter to 150 million this quarter. Can you just touch on what change there and is that going to have any effect on the pro forma yield that you guys are looking at? Owen Thomas : So, the reason that the cost were driven up were almost entirely due to the lease that we have with NYU which is a 30 year lease versus what we originally underwrote which would have been a shorter term lease, effectively kind of 15 years would have been what we would have underwrote. So the leasing commission associated with that and the tenant improvement associated with that are the majority of that increase and that lease officially came out of escrow within the last quarter. So we determine to put that into our budget this quarter because there was uncertainty. The only other thing that really changed on this, we\u2019re making some enhancements to the retail aspect of the job and improving the design and what the retail environment and atmosphere is going to be that takes the most significant advantage of the opportunity that we have to upgrade the place taking there, so that's a design is driving a little bit more cost into that part of the job, as well. And but we still expect the project to meet the return criteria that we typically sellout for this type of development. Doug Linde : But just to be perfectly honest about this, this is a place making exercise as we said there is a great incremental investment on the works that we did at $159 to the 185,000 square feet that we release to the tenants that taking for 30 years. The incremental return on the capital for the food hall and the other \"place making experiences is de minimis\", and it\u2019s really going to be reflected in the ability to rent space at 601 Lexington Avenue, 399 Park Avenue, and 599 Lexington Avenue, so it's not really -- the yield was not with that result. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Feldman with Bank of America. Jamie Feldman : I'm hoping to get related thoughts on co-working and what you think that tenant base is going to mean for the office sector going forward? I mean we've seem, rework has had a little bit of trouble raising its flash around the capital and we've seen kind of proliferation of different types of approaches to that business. So, as we -- just kind of an update on what your latest thoughts are and what you think it's going to mean for you guys? Owen Thomas : It's Owen. Look, we continue to believe co-working I'll call it shared workspace business to be an important sector of the office business it's been, it's been an important net absorber of space, I think in the markets where we operate, the total square footage of this lease by these operators today is somewhere between 2.5% and 5% depending on the city and it has been growing. We work as clearly the leader by scale, but there are other operators and in fact as discussed on our prior call where we've been doing it some of it ourselves on a small scale basis in a couple of our buildings. So I think the business has created important new options for customers for individual and retail customers it's a way to get into a community and a high quality space and in many cases, high-quality buildings and from landlords it's aggregated demand that would be otherwise very difficult to leases too. So I think that's been very positive. And I think for a larger companies it's given them flexibility, we don't see companies -- large companies taking all of their space requirements and putting it into shared workspace, but we certainly see some of them procuring single-digit percentages of their space on a flexible basis to try to manage that -- the space procurement process which can be difficult, when human resource requirements are a lot more volatile than their ability to procure space. So, there has been a lot of press lately about we work ability to raise additional equity capital that may have some impact on the business. We don't know yet, but in general, I would say this sector is an important part of the office business, and as we think it's been a very positive and many of the shared workspace companies like we work are important customers of Boston properties. Doug Linde : And Jaime just to add a couple more thoughts, so if we think about our portfolio and how the flexible office operators have impacted our portfolio and the margin we think it's been a positive trends for the kinds of spaces that we have listed them in the places where we have lease that space and at the same time and I don\u2019t think its coincidence we have done more large, long term leasing with corporate customers, call it the last 2.5 to 3 years than we have ever done in our history. And our average lease rent has actually gone up slightly as opposed to down slightly. So it has not impacted our business at all in terms of our portfolio other than again in those instances where we have done a transaction with one of these operators we think it's incrementally help us in some way shape or form. In Washington DC its aggregating demand and Embarcadero center it changed the image of a particular space which we use as a showcase to demonstrate to nontraditional tenants how they could use Embarcadero centers infrastructure to change the image of their space at 200 Clarendon St. we were struggling with convincing people that this was not a attired state financial services building and we did a transaction and then we got a whole host of customers who actually use the flexible officer provider space on a short-term basis while we were building out their space in the building so it was a great shock absorber. So there are lots of different reasons why this company works. And it is here to stay there are clearly places where all kinds of companies think about how this might be helpful to their portfolios, but as Owen said it is not going to displace the business that we are in. And we are very comfortable that we can work cooperatively with these types of users in a symbiotic way. James Feldman : Do you have any thoughts on how much larger the sector can become? I know you have mentioned that kind of less than 5% to most markets. Doug Linde : Well, so I think its market dependent right. I used an example of San Francisco and in San Francisco there just over call it 3 million square feet of space. There is no availability there are no blocks of space. If they wanted to double in size they would have to take every single block of space that is coming available in the next year two years three years in order to get there and that\u2019s just not going to happen. Similarly, in Boston it\u2019s a very competitive market and so it's just going to be really, really hard for them to grow in a meaningful way relative to the percentage of the market. So I think it's going to be different market by market. Bryan, do you any thoughts on that? Bryan Koop : Yes, I think part of it is also identification of product bifurcations. So for example the traditional co-working is different than enterprise leasing in the smaller spaces without the community aspects to it. So it's almost a totally different product and what's taken place out there is everybody is lumping everything together and it creates some illusions that you probably are not necessary in terms of the size and scope. So a lot of this has to do by defining what the product is. So as an example with our flex product we don't have the community managers, we are not looking to provide additional services. It's just highly flexible space that\u2019s a shorter-term lease and that's quite different than other products. So a lot of it has to do with their business lumping everything together. James Feldman : And then, we have seen a lot of large leases from tech and media companies in the last couple of years. What gives you comfort that the space that they will use and we are not seeing excessive expansion here? Doug Linde : So Jaime, in comparison to 1999 to 2001 year in the dotcom era, the companies that are taking down the space are what we refer to in our small circle is tech tightened and these companies which have multifaceted businesses, multifaceted growth aspirations, and they are hiring people at enormous rates. And so, they are filling their space as quickly as they can get it. And interestingly what is going on is that they are looking to find those locations that are closest where the talent is and where they can attract the talent. And just as again sort of to talk about Downtown San Jose, the reason that side is so interesting to us today and remember that we do have another site in Downtown San Jose that we have owned for 20 years and we haven\u2019t gotten going yet. So, this was the double down in Downtown San Jose, is that the idea that companies are going to put their employees that are living in the city of San Francisco, put them on coach boxes and have them travel down to 280 or the 101 for up to three hours a day of the commute it's just becoming really tired. And so having the ability to have a transit oriented location, where they can get on the Caltrain Bullet stop in San Francisco and be down in Downtown San Jose in about an hour is a very, very attractive preposition, and Google has also made a commitment to build housing and retail and also some other things. So, it was going to become a really interesting Downtown. And our view is that the market has really changed down there. And so what was once going to be an 800 plus thousand square foot either office or residential site at the Plaza at Almaden, we are now permitting for a minimum of 1.3 million square feet and could be larger than that. The parking ratios have changed. The use of trifurcation has changed and we just think these are the types of locations where companies are going to go. And you\u2019ve obviously seen Amazon and Google and Facebook make tremendous piece of the base acquisitions across their marketplaces, not just in Silicon Valley, but in Los Angeles and in Austin and in Boston and in Washington DC. And we just -- we\u2019re comfortable with these companies are long-term growth organizations that are going to be very aggressive about hiring talent to feed their businesses. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Garrick Johnston from Deutsche Bank. Garrick Johnston : How was the entitlement process for new CBD development currently shaping out by market? And I was wondering if you had experience any deltas notable we're sharing? Doug Linde : So, do you have half hour 45 minutes, that\u2019s how long will take to answer that question. Why don't I let Bob Pester talk about what\u2019s going on in San Francisco. Obviously, with our site at Fort Harrison and at the CBD site, and then I'll let Bryan talk about, what\u2019s going on at Back Bay in Boston, Boston because those are sort of the two entitlement opportunities that are in front of us right now. Garrick Johnston : In San Francisco, the Central SoMa plan was proved and immediately there were four lawsuits filed which all are CEQA land suits, which pretty much will put everything on hold unless they are settled or someone could elect to go ahead and be subject to whatever happens in the lawsuits. San Francisco continues to be probably one of the most difficult markets in the United States to get entitled in, and other than the 6 Central SoMa sites that are called super sites. The Giants Mission Rock in Pier 70, there is not a lot on the horizon as far as feature development in San Francisco of any significance. Doug Linde : So in Boston, our project in the Back Bay is probably most significant on the commercial side. We do have some residential components to it and we see that to be at least the couple more years of permitting. But not having to do with anything other than that\u2019s the process and it\u2019s a complicated site over a transportation hub. So the Back Bay has limited amount of foreseeable, will say product line coming on in the commercial side. And that goes for Cambridge as well. We are seeing as it was noted earlier a real discipline amongst the developers who have states that are permitted and all seem to be conditioned on preleasing as well. Garrick Johnston : And just last one for me. It was interesting to see the land acquisition at Carnegie Center in Princeton. I was wondering, if you just share some further thoughts on the suburban addition? And I'm assuming this would be a preleased type of development perhaps life sciences, anymore inflow there would be interesting? Doug Linde : When Boston Properties bought Carnegie Center 20 years ago, we bought the buildings and we got plus option to purchase the site. And over the years, we have purchased a handful of the sites and done build the suites for customers. That option expired last year. So we were faced with the decision on whether to let the option expire or to exercise and purchase all the land part. So we access -- we obviously elected the latter. So we do have all this land, we acknowledge Princeton is not our fastest growing market. That all being said we do have some uses for the land. So for example, right now we have a customer parking need that we're going to satisfy with the -- with one of the lots that repurchase, we anticipate our ability to sell some of these individual paths which we will do, but perhaps most importantly, our perspective is our investment in Carnegie center is more valuable with the buildings and the development opportunity, unified rather than as they are being separated and that was a key driver of the division. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Alexander Goldfarb : So two questions, first, just sort of continuing on the Princeton theme. Mike, you spoke about getting exciting, fully exciting Annapolis Junction. Princeton, it sounds like you may exit as well or you may keep. But as you outline your guidance for this year, is there a certain amount of dispositions that's in their meaning if you fully exited Annapolis Junction or anything else, does that impact your guys ability to deliver on your growth this year? Or is there some potential that dispositions could disrupt what you guys have laid out? Owen Thomas : Alex, I am going to answer the former and I'll let Mike jump in on the latter. So, we have no current plans to exit our Princeton investment. We do think purchasing this land for the reasons I just outline on the last question, we think our investment in the whole project is more valuable by owning the land, but we have no near term plans at exit it. That all being said a week intend in 2019 to continue with our non-core asset disposition plan and again we haven't finalized our exact list this year, but I would anticipate that it will revert back to levels of '16 and '17, which would be and accounted to $250 million maybe $300 million sales in 2019. Mike LaBelle : And Alex, as reflected in guidance as I mentioned in my call notes. We haven't included anything additional other than what's in our release for asset sales within our guidance. So some of what were selling as Owen said is non-core some of it is land parcel that we don\u2019t think we're going to develop, so we really don\u2019t have a meaningful impact. Than a lot of the other non-core stuff you're talking about is kind of suburban stuff that is not that big. So, yes, some of it does have NOI that would come out so we're going to get cash and we would deploy that cash so that would help and it would reduce our line of credit usage. So there is kind of both sides of it and without knowing exactly which assets there are we think it was inappropriate thing to do that kind of put up ex amount in the guidance. We would rather just say there is nothing in the guidance and give us time to think kind of things we are thinking about. But I don't think it would have a meaningful its not going to be huge, its not going to have a meaningful impact. Alexander Goldfarb : And then the second question is sort of continuing the co-working theme. Dock 72 initially takes occupancy in the second quarter of this year, still only 33% leased. It's one sort of outlier in your New York portfolio. Presumably, you want to lease it up before assessing what your options are with it. But as you stand today, what are your thoughts on keeping that versus selling it as I say, it stands out versus the rest your portfolio in New York? Owen Thomas : So Alex, we have no plans to sell Dock 72. Our current focus as you suggest is certainly leasing the asset and that\u2019s what we are focused on now. Operator : Your next question comes from Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Tom Catherwood : A quick question on New York and then Reston; In New York, Mike or I think Doug, I appreciate your commentary as far as leases over $100 a square foot. You mentioned though obviously the slower demand when it goes over $120 a square foot. What are you seeing as far as interest in and options for your vacant space at 767 Fifth? Owen Thomas : So, John, do you want to take that. John Powers : Yes, well, we think the market last year was really hot 32.4 million. We haven\u2019t had a year like that in New York since 2000. So, this is really a lot of momentum. And notwithstanding the equity market jitters at the end of December, having talk now to a number of brokers and looking at the market, things still do you rolling along. So, we are optimistic about what's happening at GM, but we do have competition coming on place during the year. 425 Park is going to be a great building and 550 Madison the top floors are going to be good. But we think the product is still outstanding the best in the market and we are starting to work on those blocks that are coming up in '19, '20 now. Tom Catherwood : And then, John, maybe one more on the GM building, anymore clarity as far as the timing of the ins and outs for the retail portion? John Powers : Yes, we are working very hard with Apple on the Apple Store, and we don't have a date, but certainly that date will be sometime in the first half of this year. And we are working also with Under Armour because Apple is the temp store now and wants to stay there and we work things with Under Armour. So that will work for them although the Under Armour still will be delayed, resulting as the result of the Apple staying in the temp store. And we do have some Cartier left of course and we do have some interest in that space, and we think just something there in the first half of this year. Tom Catherwood : And then just quick one on Reston. Doug, I think you mentioned a place making project down in the town center and making some improvements there. What were you referencing to? And do you have a sense of what that cost impact could be? Doug Linde : Peter, do you want to take that? Peter Johnston : Sure, so, this has been going on for probably in terms of design and rebranding of the lower year. And in the next quarter or so, we\u2019re going to start the actual physical improvements. We have done a few minor ones. To a lot of the public around, through the Town Center there\u2019s a few been there, there is a number of larger public open venues, the pavilion area around the fountain et cetera. And I would say over the course of probably the next 24 months, we\u2019re looking at investment that\u2019s probably plus or minus in the $3 million. We\u2019re also in the Fountain Square buildings which the original office building already underway with redoing those lobbies which were ready for the refresh that is 25 plus years old. So, I hope that answers your question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Ismail with Green Street Advisors. Daniel Ismail : Just a bigger picture question on the utilization space by your tenants. One of your peers in some recent years articles have suggested that the justification trends of the last few years may have over short the mark. Curious what are you seeing in your end portfolio with respect a new or renewal leases? And how you guys are planning for new developments in terms of space per employee? Owen Thomas : So, why don't start with Bryan and then if any of the other guys want to chime in, they should do that. Bryan Koop : Yes, one of the things that ties with the question about how clients are using their space earlier, was that the sophistication with these clients are working with the great examples of Verizon, is incredible versus let\u2019s say the year 2000 when you had growth from tech companies that were gabling down space and really didn\u2019t have an idea of their utilization, their growth rates et cetera. What we\u2019re finding across the board is the sophistication of the users is very knowledgeable of how they are use that, how much space they\u2019re going to use it, and its far more accurate in terms of their needs. So because of that we can shift that also been a great discipline that\u2019s been added to the market and then you add that with the shock absorbers that Doug mentioned in terms of how they are using some of the these shorter term space. I think it's really healthy. Owen Thomas : Bob, you might want to describe how everyone has been building out Salesforce Tower, right. Because it\u2019s the newest sort of CBD building that we have and how their \"program\" has worked. Bob Pester : The build out varies the tenant on the type of the tenant that I can say in the case, Salesforce it's all been seeding for the most part and they're about a 160 square feet per employee. I know that they have relaxed their requirement as far as trying to get tighter than that. Initially, I think they were targeting a 120 when Ford Fish was there renting the real estate department. Daniel Ismail : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And maybe just staying in San Francisco, have you guys noticed with I know it's only about a month in 2018, but any impacts on proposition fee either on the tenant side or near and if your ability to push through that increase on new leasing? Owen Thomas : Yes, I would respond that. We haven\u2019t seen any pushback from tenants on that and we haven\u2019t seen any tenants that leave the market based on -. Operator : We have time for one final question and that question is a follow-up question from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi. Manny Korchman : Thanks for taking follow-up guys. Just Doug or John, could you just run through your rent growth expectations throughout the different submarkets of New York? Doug Linde : John, you want to start? John Powers : Rent growth in submarkets of New York. So, first, when we say, we don't have a lot of space to lease. So, if you are talking about our buildings, there is only a few building -- few pieces of space that we have to look at. I think will do well at GM and will have some rent close there clearly the block we have left at 399 there will be wrinkles there and that's probably states that over a $100 a foot. 159 is all leased and I guess when we look at the base of 510, I would say will definitely have rent growth there over the deal we've had in place. Owen Thomas : Okay, I think that completes all of our questions. Thank you everyone for your interest in Boston Properties. Operator : This concludes today's Boston Properties conference call. Thank you again for attending and have good day.",

And I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks. Owen Thomas : Okay. Thank you, Sara, and good morning everyone. We had another strong quarter of performance and are successfully executing on our strategy for continued revenue and income growth. Highlights for this quarter include, we grew our FFO per share 15% over the first quarter of 2018, which was also $0.05 above the midpoint of our guidance for the quarter and $0.06 above street consensus. We raised our full-year 2019 FFO per share guidance by $0.05 at the midpoint, which would result in a 11% FFO growth above 2018. We completed one 1.5 million square feet of leasing for in-service properties, which is well above our long-term quarterly average for the period and we increased the occupancy for our in-service office and retail portfolio 150 basis points from the last quarter to 92.9%. this also marked 240 basis point increase from a year ago. Also this past month, we completed an early renewal and expansion of our lease with Bank of America at a 100 Federal Street in Boston for 545,000 square feet. We obtained construction financing for the Marriott headquarters development on favorable terms, and we issued our 2018 sustainability report and were selected as a 2019 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year, the highest recognition possible from the EPA for distinguished corporate energy management programs. Moving to the economy. Overall economic conditions continue to be stable and overall favorable for Boston Properties. Initial U.S. GDP growth estimates for the first quarter were 3.2% will surpass in prior estimates. Job creation remains steady with 540,000 jobs created in the first quarter and unemployment continues to be low at 3.8%. The Fed has turned accommodative, as indicated, it will not raise interest rates for the foreseeable future and intends to pause quantitative tightening by year-end. As a result, the 10-year U.S. Treasury has been steady so far this year dropping around 20 basis points to 2.5%. This economic landscape is not exclusively rosy with GDP growth in Europe and China declining and prospects for escalating trade tension. In our business, we\u2019re experiencing confidence and fundamentally strong leasing activity with our customers and our core markets. With the exception of the Washington DC\u2019s Central Business District. Rents continue to escalate markedly in Boston and San Francisco, driven by strong demand and minimal new supply. Given this backdrop and the broader set of economic signals, we do not anticipate a near-term economic correction. That said, we continue to keep our aggregate debt levels low and ensure our developments are appropriately pre-leased before launch. As we know, an economic turn is inevitable and difficult to precisely predict. So as a result, we are well positioned to take advantage of ongoing economic growth and to whether a contraction with durable cash flows. The private real estate market for our assets and our core markets remained strong and liquid. In terms of the data, significant office transaction volume ended the first quarter at $17.5 billion, down 31% from the fourth quarter of last year and down 21% from first quarter of 2018. The volumes are lower; anecdotally, we are finding our pursuit of new investments to be highly competitive both for buildings and sites. Animal spirits seem alive and well as financing costs are lower than 2018 and most investors are not overly concerned about a near-term production. Yet again, there were numerous significant asset transactions in our markets this past quarter. Starting in the Boston, Financial District, 75 State Street is under agreement to be recapitalized for $635 million, which is $755 a square foot and a 4.4% cap rate. This is an 840,000 square foot property. It\u2019s 98% leased and it\u2019s being recapitalized with a joint venture of offshore capital and fund managers. In New York, a 38-story, 1.5 million square foot single tenant office condo at 30 Hudson Yards sold for $2.2 billion or $1,500 a square foot and a 5% stabilized cap rate. The condominium interest is 100% leased to Time Warner for 15 more years and was sold to a developer fund manager backed by institutional investors. In San Francisco, a 49% interest in 200 Howard Street, better known as the Park Tower building is under agreement to sell at an imputed value of $1.1 billion or $1,445 of square foot and a low to mid-4% cap rate. The recently constructed building is 762,000 square feet is fully leased and is being sold to a developer fund manager backed by Sovereign Wealth Fund. And finally, in West LA, Wilshire Courtyard is under agreement to sell for $625 million or $627 a foot and a cap rate of 2.5% although that is artificially low, because the assets not stabilized. The building comprises just under a million feet in a 60% leased and being sold to a North American developer investor. So, moving to our capital activities. Development continues to be our primary strategy for creating value for shareholders and our pipeline of current and future developments remains robust. Our current development pipeline stands at 11 office and residential developments, and redevelopments comprising 5.3 million square feet and $2.7 billion of investment for our share. Most of the pipeline is well underway and we have $1.6 billion of total capital remaining to fund. The commercial component of this portfolio is 78% pre-leased and aggregate projected cash yields are approximately 7%. In 2019, we expect to commence 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue, which is a 469,000 square foot Class A office building located in the Central Business District of Washington DC. The building is 66% pre-leased and will be an estimated $360 million investment. We will also start the redevelopment of 325 Main Street, in Kendall Center in Cambridge following the long-term lease agreement we signed with Google this past quarter. The current 115,000 square foot building will be demolished and replaced with a new 400,000 square foot office tower, the office component of which will be fully occupied by Google. As part of the agreement, Google will extend their current leases for an additional 15 years and two of our other buildings in Kendall Center comprising 450,000 square feet. As a result, we will have an over 800,000 square foot long-term relationship with Google at Kendall Center. Total project cost is $450 million plus the value of the existing building. As part of the local zoning, we are required to develop a residential building of at least 200,000 square feet at Kendall Center with 25% of the units reserved as affordable. The office project will commence in 2019 and the residential project is currently moving through its design approval process. In San Jose, we are completing predevelopment work for our recently completed land investment at Platform 16. We have made presentations to multiple potential large users and are in discussions with a capital partner to invest with us in the project. On dispositions, we are targeting approximately $300 million in asset sales this year. We recently entered a binding agreement to sell One Tower Center, a 410,000 square foot office building located in East Brunswick, New Jersey for $38 million. The property is 39% leased and in a challenging location far from the stronger demand dynamics we experience in Princeton at Carnegie Center. So, this decision is in line with our strategy of disposing select non-core assets. Although the sale resulted in an impairment charge, there\u2019s no substantial loss of income and our companywide portfolio occupancy will increase by approximately 50 basis points. We also put on the market this quarter 540 Madison Avenue located in Midtown Manhattan. Our 40% joint-venture partners in this 284,000 square foot asset wanted to sell their interest. After reviewing expected sale outcomes with our advisor and understanding a sale of 100% interest in the property would likely yield better pricing. We decided it was in the best interest of our shareholders to sell our position as well. The marketing process is underway and there has been substantial interest in the asset to date from prospective buyers. Lastly, we have recently been asked by many of you about the ramifications and potential cost to landlords of the Climate Mobilization Act passed by the New York City Council last month. The goal of the bill is to reduce city carbon emissions 40% by 2030, and 80% by 2050. Boston Properties supports greenhouse gas reduction policies, has already established its own public greenhouse gas reduction targets and has actually reduced the greenhouse gas emissions intensity of our buildings by 39% over the last 10 years through investments in new energy efficient systems and utilizing more sustainable energy supplies. Details of all this are available in our annual sustainability report, which we released last month. We started down this important road many years ago given the business case for investment in energy efficiency, the contribution of the built environment to global emissions and \u2013 and in anticipation of local regulations such as the recently passed Climate Mobilization Act in New York that will likely continue to strengthen over time in our other core markets. Specifically, related to New York, we think our portfolio already substantially meets the 2024 emission targets set by the new regulations and have plenty of time to make additional enhancements, probably by acquiring more sustainable energy sources by 2030 when the second phase of emission targets take effect. Given our shared mission on climate with our communities and our leadership role in sustainability, we hope to work cooperatively with New York and our other city partners to create logical and effective legislation to accomplish reduced greenhouse gas emissions. So, in conclusion, Boston properties is off to a strong start in 2019. We completed another quarter of successful execution with 15% year-over-year FFO per share growth. We increased full-year guidance for 2019 to 11% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Economic conditions remain favorable. Tenant demand remains strong. And we continue to lay the foundation for continued company growth beyond 2019. As I look at Boston Properties today, I\u2019m delighted with our progress. We continue to outperform our sector in terms of FFO growth with an attractive pipeline of pre-leased development, healthy same-store NOI growth, a new and refreshed portfolio and modest leverage with capacity to support additional investments. Let me turn over the call to Doug. Doug Linde : Thanks, Owen, and good morning everybody. So, we are seeing the constructive macro environment that Owen described in his remarks really reflected in the actions of our customers, our tenants. When I dissect the activity that we\u2019re seeing in Boston, CBD, the Cambridge markets, suburban Boston, San Francisco, the Silicon Valley, LA, it\u2019s really driven by the growth from the technology and the life science and media, financial services and professional services firms that are that make up the demand markets. In midtown Manhattan, we have service providers like law firms that are continuing to expand, although the rebuilding of more efficient spaces moderated their growth somewhat and the successful financial firms are growing while the challenging results from hedge funds have created some space reductions in that market as well. In Northern Virginia, there are a number of tech titans that I\u2019ve identified, the DC metro employment base as a fertile area for incremental expansion, Amazon aside and the increase in defense spending has led to expansion by those organizations that service that sector of the government or homeland security. It\u2019s the supply that is regulating whether a market or submarket is strong and landlord favorable or week and tenant friendly. In the office business, where we have long leases, our average lease length today is over seven years. Spot market conditions don\u2019t immediately show up in our results. Last quarter, I described Salesforce Tower, where we signed our first lease in April of 2014, we achieve our fully occupied run rate in October of 2019 and based on the last few deals done in inferior building, some rents about 40% below market today. This quarter, we signed our lease with Google to build the new 325 Main Street. We started that least negotiation in 2017 along with the extension for 450,000 square feet that Owen described. And the cash contractual extension rent increase on that 450,000 square feet, which commences in 2025, is 27% higher and because rents have moved so quickly, that number in 25 is 25% below today\u2019s market rent. Let\u2019s talk about the markets. Our expectations in what\u2019s going on in our portfolio. I\u2019ll begin with Boston. Over the last few quarters, you\u2019ve heard me describe the extraordinary demand, which Boston and Cambridge have seen along with a very limited supply pipeline. The new buildings being delivered are not two million square foot towers, but rather 400,000 to 500,000 square foot mid-rise buildings, they have all found either pre-releases or pre-delivery lead tenants with a very little aggregate speculative space. Existing inventory is full and contiguous full floors are hard to find. In our portfolio, this is led to tenant inspired early renewals. Last week, we completed a 545,000 square foot, 15-year lease extension with BOA at 100 Federal Street starting in 2022. The net rent is increasing by more than 37%. At 200 Clarendon Street, we\u2019ve completed 45,000 square feet of early renewal and our documenting another 89,000 square feet of leases expiring in 2022 with an average increase of over 30% on a net basis. In the realm of no good deed goes unpunished, because we\u2019re going from gross to net leases at 200 Clarendon Street, it\u2019s actually going to result, believe it or not, in a reduction in our short-term GAAP income until the new lease structure is kicking in 2022. In addition to our Google transaction in Cambridge with no available direct space in our portfolio, we were still able to complete a 35,000 square foot \u2013 feet of additional 2022 tenant requested extensions and here, the increase is only a 100% on a net basis. You should know to large decline in our occupancy at 325 Main Street. We terminated all of the retail leases, 47,000 square feet this quarter and we will complete the vacation of the building total loss of about $4 million per year on an annualized basis by the end of the second quarter, and this will impact our results in 2019, 2020 and 2021. Given the increased demand by life science tenants in Greater Boston, we\u2019re converting a number of buildings from straight office to office lab used in our suburban portfolio. The first such building lease was signed this quarter at 33 Hayden Avenue in Lexington, because of previous investments by the vacating tenant. We\u2019re only investing about $35 a square foot in base building upgrades and the net rent is moving up by 86%. We intend to convert 200 West Street in Waltham to a similar facility. You\u2019ll see a drop in occupancy as we vacate 50% of this building to enable the lab conversion. In this case, we\u2019re investing about a $130 per square foot on the apical square footage and we\u2019ll have a similar pickup in rent expectation. Lab rents are about $50 triple net in the Waltham, Lexington market. We expected double-digit incremental return on the incremental investment, and as we permanent design all of our new suburban products, it is being positioned as lab ready. 180 City Point, our next development site in Waltham is a 300,000 square foot building that fits this bill. We did have a few leasing disappointments during the quarter involving our development assets. We had a lease out for execution canceled for the remainder of our 100 Causeway Tower when the customer was sold in an M&A transaction and we had a life science company ready to sign 50,000 square feet at 20 City Point and its product had a disappointing trial and so that lease was canceled as well. We expect, we will replace these tenants with higher rents and lower concessions, rents in Boston and Cambridge and Waltham, Lexington have great increases in 2018 along with the decline of concessions and we expect the same in 2019. In New York City, we made a lot of news last quarter with our leasing transactions at 399 park. The New York City leasing dynamics have not changed in the last 90 days. All the known deliveries in the far west side are happening. We haven\u2019t seen rents suddenly increased and we haven\u2019t seen concessions change. Our portfolio focus today is at the General Motors building and our 97,000 square foot block of available space at 399 Park Avenue. At the moment, we have one high-rise floor available at GM 40,000 square feet, but by the end of the first quarter of 2020, we\u2019ll have an \u2013 we have additional known move out of about 170,000 square feet. This space contributes about $13 million for 2019. Combining this, 210,000 square feet with the 97,000 square feet that\u2019s available at 399 Park Avenue. This portfolio of space should ultimately contribute revenue of about $27 million as we sign leases and commence revenue in 2020 and 2021, more than 50% of the space will be leased under $105 a square foot and the rest should demand rent in excess of $130 a square foot. The financial markets in the latter part of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 were not kind to the hedge fund community, which along with private equity shops and boutique financial advisors; make up a significant portion of the high-end demand in this market, rents in excess of $127 a square foot. As I\u2019ve described previously, the leasing in this Manhattan submarket is not about the incremental price or concession package. It\u2019s simply a matter of a smaller demand pool and at the moment, that segment of demand is somewhat light. Construction at Dock 72 is progressing. We expect rework will be open by September 1 and we expect to open the amenity space by early October. Tenant interest is picking up and we received our first full floor proposal from a technology company last week. The fairy should be operational in May and we will be able to begin to showcase what dock 72 has to offer. It\u2019s a pretty great tour and you should all go over and take a look. You should note that we have extended our stabilization projection to the third quarter of 21 and this, along with some base building costs, increases has resulted in the increase in the project budget that you see in our supplemental information. The challenging supply conditions along with the more challenging demand pool in the Washington DC CBD market continued to pressure at the spot leasing market there. We don\u2019t believe there\u2019s 150,000 square foot law firm with an expiration prior to 2023 active in the market. The GSA has very aggressive pricing requirements all about eliminating their ability to lease higher quality available space. There were significant new availability and the competition is fierce from more granual near-term demand. In the CBD, the flexible office providers continue to be a positive as that segment of the market continues to absorb medium space blocks of space and they are truly aggregating demand that we would never accommodate. While face rent on leases are stable, it\u2019s all about concessions and more importantly, rent commencement dates. The good news is that we are reasonably well at least in the district with modest near-term exposure and we have sold down our position significantly over the last few years. Almost 10% of the company NOI resonated from northern Virginia, where the demand picture is much more robust. We have known future availability in 2020 approaching 500,000 square feet with the biggest block stemming from our delivery to Leidos in March of 2020 and the departure of tenant, whose growth we will not be \u2013 we could not accommodate in 2017 and 2018. We are in active discussions with two existing tenants that are looking to expand their 50,000 square foot installations, three new tenants looking for a minimum of 75,000 square feet each in a number of 7,000 to 10,000 square foot users that are focused on this amenity rich environment. While the Reston Town Center ecosystem will win the day for many of these users, there will be some interruption in income as we retained at the space, the 2020 reduction in revenue from the known expirations, there\u2019s about $17 million. Moving west, in LA, while Colorado Center has 100% leased that we were actively marketing the 140,000 square foot block that HBO will vacate on 12/31/20 as well as our 2021 lease expirations. At the Santa Monica Business Park, we are also working about getting ahead of our late 2020 expirations. The West LA market had an active 2018 and the beginning of 2019 was active as well as a number of major technology and media companies expanded their footprints in the area. Rental rates continue to rise in a moderate rate and there are limited big block availabilities. In San Francisco, the sequel litigation involving Central SoMa and the new questions on how Prop M should be allocated, have heightened the focus on the lack of availability in the CBD for the foreseeable future. We don\u2019t believe there\u2019s going to be a quick resolution to these issues. The vacancy rate is at its lowest level since this last cycle begin after the great financial crisis. You would be hard pressed to find an existing 100,000 square foot block of continuous space in the market, direct or sublease. The only new construction, the first admission development has an uncertain delivery days and it won\u2019t deliver before 2023. 633 Folsom, the only large addition major renovation has already been leased. There continued to be significant demand in the market with tenants like Pinterest and Salesforce committing to unentitled developments. In our portfolio, Salesforce Tower, 535 Mission, 680 and 690 Folsom, 50 Hawthorne are all 100% leased. In Embarcadero center, we ended the quarter at 93.2% occupied, up 200 basis points from the last quarter and completed 235,000 square feet of full or multi-floor leasing. The percentage increase in rents from those floors was over 50% with an average new starting rate of $85 a square foot growth. Similar to Boston, tenants are requesting early renewal proposals. We currently have another 175,000 square feet under negotiation that could be completed during the second quarter of 2019. If a tenant wants a full floor at Embarcadero center, it has one option prior to July of 2020. In the Silicon Valley, we continue to release our renew space at Mountain View Research at rents in excess of $60 triple net. This quarter, we completed a 47,000 square foot lease with a 60% roll up. And over the last two weeks, we did two renewals, totaling 91,000 square feet and have it \u2013 had an average increase of 80%. At platform 16 as Owen described, we are enabling the site preparing it for construction and we\u2019re making presentations to tenants, who are looking for 400,000 square feet or more and there are a number of them. I\u2019m going to conclude my remarks this morning with some comments about the same property leasing steps for the quarter. You\u2019ll note a big jump in transaction costs. The statistics include one million square feet of 10-year or longer deals in New York City and San Francisco. This includes about 90,000 square feet of prebuilt suites or turnkey floors that we did. And we\u2019ve been describing those over in the last few years, where the improvements are in excess of $150 a square foot. Obviously, there\u2019s a tradeoff with accelerated occupancy, which is never reflected in the transaction cost numbers. Saving six months of downtime on a $100 rent, offsets the transaction costs of a deal by $50. And remember, we include the entire TI Package and commission into our statistics when we commence revenue recognition while the actual outlay of cash will occur over many quarters. So, in conclusion, competition for talent remains top of mind for our customers and they continue to seek premium Class A space that reflects their brand and values. 2019 is progressing as we expected and we continue to be well positioned to grow our FFO in the coming years. I\u2019ll stop here, Mike? Mike LaBelle : Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning. As Owen described, we had a strong quarter and raised our full-year FFO guidance again, and are now projecting 11% year-over-year FFO growth at the midpoint. Before I get into the details of the quarter, I do want to start with a couple of housekeeping items. First, you will notice that we\u2019ve adopted the new lease accounting standard that was required this quarter, which adds right of use, operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities to our balance sheet. And on our income statement, rental income, operating expense recoveries and service fee income are now required to be reported together as lease income. For clarity, we will continue to provide the breakout of these items in our supplemental report. The requirement to include service fee income and lease revenue is creating geographic movement on our income statement as we had previously included service fee income in our development and management services income. This change also impacts the components of our 2019 FFO guidance assumptions and we\u2019ve relocated approximately $8 million from development and management services income into our share of same property NOI. This shift increases our assumption for growth and our share of same property NOI by 50 basis points in 2019 from our guidance last quarter. I apologize for the accounting minutia, but I wanted to make sure everybody understands these changes. Now, let\u2019s get into the details for the quarter. Q1 marked another strong quarter with 15% year-over-year FFO increase driven primarily by a 10% increase in our revenues from gains in portfolio occupancy, higher replacement rents on new and renewal leasing, and incremental revenue recognition from our development deliveries. This quarter, the roll up and rents from our second generation leasing was 9.4% on a net basis. Our in-service portfolio occupancy improved by 150 basis points to 92.9%, primarily from gains at 399 Park Avenue in New York City and Salesforce Tower and Embarcadero Center in San Francisco. We anticipate that occupancy will range between 92.5% and 93.5% for the year. A part of this is due to faster than projected lease up and part is due to the anticipated sale of One Tower Center and removing 325 Main Street in Cambridge from service for the Google redevelopment. The removal of these two properties would increase our occupancy by 60 basis points. In the debt markets, we just closed a $255 million construction loan to provide funding for the Marriott headquarters development. The loan is priced very attractively at LIBOR plus 125 basis points and reflects the quality of the project and the long-term lease with Marriott Corporation. This property is in a joint venture. So, our share of the loan is 50%. Our active development pipeline represents $2.7 billion of new investment and remaining cost to fund our $1.3 billion net of the in-place construction financing. We expect to raise another $200 million of construction financing for our share of The Hub on Causeway office project later this year and the remaining costs will be funded with operating cash flow retained proceeds from asset sales and our line of credit. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.5 billion available on our line of credit and cash of $360 million. As Owen described, we decided this quarter to sell One Tower Center in New Brunswick, New Jersey, and have an executed purchase and sale contract. Our decision caused us to shorten our hold period for the building resulting in an impairment on the property to its fair market value. We booked the $24 million impairment this quarter similar to gains or losses on sales. Property impairments are part of our net income, but are excluded from FFO pursuant NAREIT\u2019s definition. The sale is actually accretive to us, because at 39% occupancy, the property provides minimal NOI and we will earn an interest income or reduce our future borrowing with the cash from the sale. Looking at first quarter results versus our guidance, our FFO of a $1.72 per share is $0.05 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range. Approximately $0.03 per share of this was related to the timing of expenses, where we came in below our budget this quarter, but we expect to incur these expenses later in 2019. So, this portion will not increase our full-year FFO. The other $0.02 per share was due to portfolio performance. So, you should really look at this as $0.02 of outperformance for the quarter. The $0.02 were split between higher than projected service fee income and higher rental revenues from leasing space faster. This leasing was in our budgets for later in the year, so it does not result in a comparable step-up in our quarterly run rate for the full year. Growth in our share of same property NOI for the quarter was strong and up over the last year by 7.7% on a GAAP basis and 9.2% on a cash basis. We project our same property NOI to show consistent growth for the remainder of the year. However, the growth rate over 2018 will slow in the back half of the year due to the comparable period in 2018 being higher. For the full year 2019, our current assumptions include growth in our share of same property NOI of 5.5% to 6.75% over 2018. Net of moving $8 million of service fee income into the calculation, this represents an increase of 38 basis points at the midpoint from the last quarter. On a cash basis, we assume same property cash NOI growth of 5% to 6.5% over 2018. We\u2019ve also modified our assumption for development and management services income to $32 million to $36 million and that reflects the reduction of $8 million for moving service fees into lease revenue. Given the more dovish outlook for interest rates in the past quarter, we\u2019ve adjusted our assumption for rates that has had a positive impact on our future financing costs in 2019. This, in combination with changes in our funding timing and additional asset sales, has resulted in our lowering our assumption for net interest expense for 2019, but $5 million to $405 million to $420 million for the full year. The result of these changes are that we\u2019re increasing our guidance for 2019 FFO to a new range of $6.95 to $7.02 per share representing an increase of $0.05 per share at the midpoint with the increase from $0.02 per share of improved portfolio NOI and $0.03 per share of lower interest expense. As you start to think about 2020, there are a few things to keep in mind. We continue to expect the portfolio NOI to grow from both our development and our same property portfolio. We expect to deliver approximately $1.4 billion of our development pipeline between mid-2019 and the end of 2020. As is typical every year, we do expect some negative impact from temporary downtime related to our lease rollover exposure. Doug described our more meaningful 2020 lease rollouts, which are the GM Building and in Reston Town Center. In addition, we will have $10 million of our share of non-cash fair value lease revenue rolling off next year with much of this at the GM Building, where we see \u2013 where we will see incremental vacancy. And finally, we expect to continue to utilize debt as the primary funding vehicle for our new developments. Although we capitalized interest on new developments, the delivery of $1.4 billion of our current pipeline, will result in a reduction of our capitalized interest and consequently higher total interest expense in 2020. So, in summary, we had a good quarter with stronger than expected portfolio performance. We increased our FFO guidance for the year. We now project 2019 FFO growth of 11% at the midpoint over 2018, which is among the highest in our sector and the demand environment remains strong based on favorable economic trends in the vast majority of our markets. And we continue to execute on the growth strategy we\u2019ve outlined for the company. That completes our remarks. Operator, I\u2019d appreciate if you could open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Nick Yulico : Thanks. I know Doug talked a little bit about the tenant improvement spend this quarter being heightened and why that was the case. Mike, I wanted to see if you could give us maybe a feel for what a full-year number would look like for a TIs and leasing commissions, and then in terms of how we should think about Fed growth this year, if that would be similar to the 10% FFO growth in your guidance. Mike LaBelle : Sure. Nick. No problem. So, Q1 is obviously as you mentioned, it was a high year for lease transaction costs. As Doug mentioned, we had some long-term leases and we also just had a tremendous amount of absorption, all right. So, we had 150 basis points of absorption to bring the portfolio up to 93% almost, which is \u2013 with that, that\u2019s kind of all drops into the quarter. So, we do not expect every quarter this year to be identical to that. I mean our occupancy projection for the year, as I mentioned is that it\u2019s basically going to be stable if you kind of pull out the asset sales and taking the Google building out of service. So, we expect occupancy to actually drop a little bit in the second quarter and then come back up in the third and the fourth quarters although the rental rates should be higher in our rollover. So, if you look at our full-year projection for what our AFFO will be in our lease transaction costs, we expect the lease transaction cost of total somewhere in the $210 million to $225 million range. So, a big chunk of this has already been experienced. And if you look at our roll over for the rest of the year, I mean, it\u2019s just not that big. So, the amount of leasing that we have to kind of get into place to keep the occupancy is not that significant. Most of the leasing that we\u2019re doing for the quarter is really going into the future years, right? So, that stuff is going into 2020 and 2021. Other pieces of our AFFO to think about include our straight line rents, which are $100 million to $120 million. Our CapEx is going to be lower. So, our recurring CapEx we think is going to be somewhere in the $75 million to $90 million range. That\u2019s about $10 million or $15 million below last year. Stock comp is around $40 million and then other non-cash items is $20 million to $25 million. So, we kind of pull all that stuff together. You get to an AFFO that is somewhere in the $4.80 to $5 a share versus $4.43 in 2018. So that\u2019s pretty significant growth, which is kind of a combination of cash same-store growth and lower CapEx. Nick Yulico : Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful, Mike. Just second question is, if I think about the commentary that Doug gave on New York, it was less positive in other markets except Washington DC. So, I guess, I mean, if we think about a lot of the leasing demand right now that you are targeting, let\u2019s say in your development portfolio, which feels like it\u2019s a lot of tech, I mean you\u2019re talking about a increasingly life science, should we think about you guys may be looking to sell even more of your New York City portfolio besides 540 Madison, perhaps assets like 399 park, which is mostly stabilized or developments that you did this cycle. Doug Linde : No, I wouldn\u2019t assume we\u2019re going to shrink our New York portfolio further. I mean, again, we\u2019re always open if we get approached by someone with we think an extraordinary results for shareholders, we\u2019re open-minded about it, but I don\u2019t think you should assume we\u2019re going to sell down our New York portfolio further. Nick Yulico : Okay. I guess if you\u2019re just trying to reconcile the commentary on New York, which just seems like, you think the market\u2019s not doing as well as some of your other markets. And so then if that\u2019s the case, why still have the \u2013 as big of a presence in New York. Owen Thomas : We think, we\u2019ve been saying this for years. We think New York is healthy. There\u2019s the aggregate, leasing demand has been at high level. Last year, it was a multiyear record for growth leasing. So, we think the market demand is healthy in New York and it\u2019s a healthy market. The issue has been supply. The Hudson Yards we have described as a secular event in the New York City real estate market and until the Hudson Yards gets fully absorbed, there will be more than typical supply in New York. And that is muting our ability to push rents up. But we certainly believe in New York in the long-term and intend to maintain a very significant presence there. Doug Linde : Yes. Contextually, Nick, if you think about the demand picture in New York City, and actually, if you were to go look at the VC investments across the country now, there\u2019s actually more money being invested into New York City than there is in the Boston marketplace. And that follows the Silicon Valley in San Francisco. So, the tech, media, fintech world is very alive and vibrant in New York City. but as Owen said, there\u2019s a supply problem, which is sort of what my point was at the outset and those marketplaces, where there\u2019s not a supply problem, we\u2019re feeling really, really strong about our opportunity set in terms of the pushing rents, in those markets where there\u2019s a supply problem, namely New York City, modest supply problem in Washington DC, CBD, a significant supply problem. We\u2019re not in a position, where we can do that. And net-net, we\u2019ve actually reduced our exposure in New York City, not necessarily by selling assets per se, but by selling interest in assets, which we did over the last, call it four or five years ago. And then we\u2019ve grown so much more in Boston and in San Francisco. Naturally, the contribution from New York City has diminished in a significant way. So, I think we\u2019ve positioned the portfolio in a really thoughtful way, on a going-forward basis. And New York City will always be part of our portfolio and we hope that, there\u2019ll be a point in time in the relative near future, where the supply picture will have cut off and the technology, the media, the fintech businesses will have grown to a sufficient population of embedded demand that we\u2019re going to see the kind of strength that we\u2019re seeing in Boston and in San Francisco in those markets \u2013 in that market as well. But it\u2019s not going to happen in 2019, 2020 or 2021. Nick Yulico : Okay. Thank you, Doug and Owen. Owen Thomas : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi. Manny Korchman : Hey, good morning everyone. Doug, you spoke a lot about early renewals and how successful we\u2019ve been with that. Can you just help us with how you think about those early renewals, especially in the case like Google, where you pointed out that even given the early renewal, you think that they will end up being below sort of market at the time the renewal starts if I understood that correctly. Doug Linde : Yes, they\u2019re below\u2026 Manny Korchman : What\u2019s that? Doug Linde : They\u2019re below market now. So, there\u2019ll be even more below market when the renewal starts. And so the logically Manny is something that I think is grounded is us for the 40 years of Boston Properties has been around, which is that, we\u2019re not market timers. We believe in leasing space to customers, who wanted to \u2013 who want to lease space when they want to lease the space. And we take our chances that doing long-term leases will serve us well and that we\u2019ll have opportunities to get the incremental growth upon rollovers and at the spot market by bringing new product online at those times. And I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to change that profile. The most interesting thing about what I was just trying to describe was that our cash rent increases in 2021 and 2022 are being driven by our transactions today. And so there\u2019s going to be significant cash flow growth from the company\u2019s perspective on a going-forward basis and it\u2019s all going to be below market assuming the markets remain as healthy as they are today. Owen Thomas : Yes. And also I would just add, I think Doug\u2019s point was we don\u2019t do early renewals below market. But the markets are moving up rapidly. So when these transactions were agreed to the market was at those levels. But the market is elevated since then. And the example that Doug gave were Google and the Salesforce now. Manny Korchman : Got it. Thanks. Mike, an easy one for you. The expenses that are getting delayed later into the year, can you be more specific as to when those will hit just for modeling purposes? Mike LaBelle : The repair and maintenance stuff I would guess will hit in the second and third quarter if I had to guess. And that is the majority of it. There was a little bit of G&A, because our healthcare costs came in a lot lower than we would expect and I anticipate that that will occur through the year. So, I would guess that it will be in second and third, and not fourth. But at least repair and maintenance item is it depends when the capital goes out, right? So, those are the stronger \u2013 those are the quarters, where we do most of that work, because of the weather related to \u2013 in the locations that we are in. Manny Korchman : And one last one for me, the 540 Madison sale. Will that have any impact on how you think about acquisitions? I guess forcing your hands acquire something to offset that. Mike LaBelle : It won\u2019t have an impact on acquisitions. I mean, if we will \u2013 as we always do, if we have a gain, we\u2019ll attempt to do like on exchange, but we won\u2019t be more tempted to buy something, because of that. If it works out in the flow of the business that we want to do based on the deals that we see that makes sense for shareholders will do the exchange, but we\u2019re not going to go out and \u201clook\u201d for an exchange deal. Manny Korchman : Thanks everyone. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Craig Mailman : Hey, good morning guys. Maybe taking the sales question from another angle. I know Mike; you said most of the development near terms going to be funded with debt. but as you look at kind of the pricing that they got on Park Tower and the below market rents you have at Salesforce, I mean, is it tempting at all to maybe look to joint venture that now that you bought in the 5% interest? Mike LaBelle : No, it\u2019s not. We think the salesforce tower is one of the premiere \u2013 certainly one of the premiere properties in our portfolio, it\u2019s a premiere port property in San Francisco, which is one of the strongest office markets in the country, if not the world. And it\u2019s not something that we want to joint venture. So, what we have been saying in terms of our sources of capital and we didn\u2019t \u2013 I didn\u2019t review that this quarter, but let me just kind of go back through that. Obviously, we generate cash flow from the company after we pay dividends. So that is a first stop for source of capital. The second would be as you\u2019re suggesting assets sales and we have been selling $200 million to $400 million or so of non-core assets each year. And that has been a source of funding for us. Last year, it was a little bit larger, because of the TSA deal that we engaged in. The third stop is debt and we \u2013 as we\u2019ve been talking about we are very focused on maintaining the leverage at current levels. So, the developments that we\u2019ve been delivering have given us increased debt capacity, which has created capital for the developments and for new investment. But there are limits to that. But we do certainly use financing to do it. The next place we would have been going is joint venture partners. So, we brought in a joint venture partner on the Santa Monica Business Park investment that we made last year. I described in my remarks that we\u2019re talking to a capital partner of platform 16. And at the bottom of the list is, issuing common equity. So, the other thing that we\u2019ve mentioned is, many of our assets, certainly, the more significant ones have a tax basis that\u2019s well below their market value. So, they\u2019re not efficient from a capital raising perspective, because of the special dividend requirement. Doug Linde : And salesforce tower in particular, yes. Owen Thomas : Yes. Doug Linde : It would have a massive gain associated with a JV of that asset that we would just have to distribute out and we wouldn\u2019t necessarily be able to retain that. So\u2026 Craig Mailman : That\u2019s helpful. And just on Platform 16, I know you guys said you\u2019re talking with a partner, but from a timing perspective, would you want to get an anchor lease before you go ahead with the joint venture or does that factor into your thinking at all? Owen Thomas : It doesn\u2019t factor into our thing today. We \u2013 when we agreed to purchase that asset we \u2013 I think, we recognize that bringing in a joint venture partner was part of the equation and the joint venture partners quite aware of the leasing activity and the conversations we\u2019re having and it\u2019s not, there\u2019s no \u201cthreshold\u201d about doing a lease to do that deal and while we \u2013 I guess in theory we could wait, get a lease and then do a joint venture at a different pricing model. We just \u2013 we felt that that was not the appropriate way to structure the capital of this particular asset. Craig Mailman : Okay. That makes sense. Just one more quick one for Mike, you mentioned the burn off of cap interest next year, is it just, I know you guys have a lot of potential developments on your plays, just the spending at the outset just can\u2019t keep up with what\u2019s burning off. So, there\u2019s no way to kind of backfill that decline. Mike LaBelle : Yes. I mean we\u2019re continuing to obviously add to our development pipeline and I wouldn\u2019t talk to about 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue and 325 Main Street. So, we are continuing to add to that, but there\u2019s just a lot that is being completed if you look at our development pipeline and you look in the supplemental and the dates of when that stuff is coming in. So in 2020, we do not expect it to keep up. So, we do expect there to be materially lower capitalized interest next year than it was this year. Craig Mailman : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Thank you. In San Francisco, can you provide an update on the likelihood of Fort Harrison, getting its Prop M allocation this year? And also if you\u2019re interested or you\u2019re looking at the Ocean White developments, given it\u2019s a pretty valuable site. Owen Thomas : So, I\u2019ll give you a succinct answer on Fort Harrison. The sequel lawsuits are ongoing. We don\u2019t anticipate the sequel lawsuits to be resolved in calendar year 2019 and we don\u2019t know how long they will take. There\u2019s a real question about how Prop M is going to be allocated. A lot of discourse and questions about that. So in our mind, it\u2019s unlikely that any of the projects will go forward that are currently part of Central SoMa in 2019 with regards to, there\u2019s a developer, who\u2019s building first admission. The project has got some \u2013 I think some timing issues, lots of people are trying to understand how they might be helpful in that situation. John Kim : And are you one of those parties? Owen Thomas : We don\u2019t comment on things that were \u2013 that we might or might not be doing. John Kim : Okay. And then, Doug, you mentioned midtown Manhattan demand \u2013 kind of the demand being liked. Do you think there\u2019s going to be additional sublease space coming into the market? And you also were positive on demand from tech and media companies, but that\u2019s really more focused on Midtown South. And I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re hearing any discussions with any of these companies moving to Midtown? Doug Linde : Yes. So, I just want to \u2013 I guess I want to reiterate what I said. I said that I felt that the demand at the very high end was lighter this quarter and last quarter than it has been. In the high end, I define as over $130 a square foot, which is those are the people, who would be going into the very expensive space. I think the market itself is actually very healthy. So, if you have $85 to $100 space, I think there are lots of people that you\u2019re talking to and there are lots of opportunities from the demand side to fill space. John, did you want to talk about the tech demand going in midtown? John Powers : No, I think that, you\u2019d have it. The demand is very good here. The issue that\u2019s holding the prices flat is the supply coming onto the market. The good news is there\u2019s a lot of people looking at the supply. John Kim : One last question on dock 72. Can you just discuss the increase in construction costs and the stabilization date being moved out? Owen Thomas : Yes. So, we\u2019ve found some things that were either in an unforeseen conditions when we were doing the site work and/or coordination issues between the contractors and the A&E professionals that have just led to some cost increases. But more importantly, given how long it\u2019s taken us to get to stabilization of the construction, which is now clearly going to happen in September. We pushed out our lease up and so we\u2019re carrying the full project cost for an extended period of time. I think it\u2019s almost a year than when we previously had. I will tell you that relative 90 days ago, the tenant activity has picked up at dock 72. And if you go over there, it feels like a pretty unique interesting opportunity for tenants to lease space with fabulous outdoor spaces with an amenity center that\u2019s going to be bar in the second to none when there was an announcement yesterday about, the new Wegmans that\u2019s going in and the other property that\u2019s under construction. Dock 72 is really shaping up. And unfortunately for us, it was more of a show me as opposed to \u2013 show me the plans but \u2013 and then we\u2019ll make a lease, but actually show me what it looks like, and I want to feel it, see it, touch it before I can really get a sense of it. And we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing right now. John, any other comments on that? John Powers : The ferries starting May 24th, that\u2019s a big plus. The shuttles are all running on time and on an app and people like it a lot. So, we\u2019re getting a lot more action. But as I\u2019ve said in this call, a number of times, this is an asset, where people, as Doug said, they\u2019re going to have to, when we work moves in September and the amenities opening in October, people can rover over and really experience it and they can take the ferry to get there. Owen Thomas : I think that I just want to clarify that a big piece of the increase is equity carry. So, it\u2019s a non-cash concept, it\u2019s something we always put on our budgets, which is the carry cost that we charge ourselves for our own equity and that obviously, impacts the job as you extend out the lease up. John Kim : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jamie Feldman : Great. Thanks and good morning. So, I wanted to start with LA and Santa Monica, can you talk more about the spaces you\u2019re getting back and what the interest pipeline looks like given we have seen a pickup in demand in some of the other kind of media focus submarkets Hollywood, Burbank some of the others, just curious what you\u2019re leasing prospects look like? Doug Linde : Yes. Let me make a quick comment then I\u2019ll have Ray, Ray pick it up. So, the only space that we know that we\u2019re getting back is the space that is currently occupied by HBO at Colorado Center and they\u2019ve made a decision to relocate to Culver Crossing, and that\u2019s going to happen 12/31/2020. So, everything else that we\u2019re working on in both the Santa Monica Business Park and Colorado Center is that space and then doing early renewals with our existing tenants in tow, which include technology and media companies, and we\u2019re encouraged by their interest in staying in the property and really, they may have some other opportunities to go outside of Santa Monica. But in Santa Monica, we\u2019re sort of the only game in town. Ray? Ray Ritchey : Yes. Thanks, Doug. So, specifically, at Colorado Center, we have a \u2013 we had discussions with Hulu regarding their future growth. HBO was kind of in the path of that growth. So, while we were sad to see HBO be one, it was strategically more important to have that block to accommodate the larger tenant. What\u2019s really interesting is while there are intense discussions with our existing tenant. Other tenants in the project are already calling us up about that space and others so that the demand in Santa Monica is just as strong as it was when we acquired the building 3.5 years ago and we see nothing in the horizon that does not have Santa Monica being a main demand driver. We are seeing some exiting to some of the other markets if it only defined larger blocks at lower prices, but we still are exceedingly excited about the Colorado Center in Santa Monica Business Park. Jamie Feldman : Hi. Thank you. And then what\u2019s your appetite to expand there? I know there\u2019s some buildings that have \u2013 that are being marketed? Ray Ritchey : Well, we are \u2013 go ahead Doherty. Robert Doherty : Yes. I was just going to say, and I\u2019ll turn it over to Ray. Our appetite remains strong. We want to grow LA into significant region for Boston Properties, just like all our other regions. However, we\u2019re going to do it in a disciplined fashion. And the way we\u2019ve been describing it to ourselves and to all of you is we want to do a deal a year that\u2019s a way to think about it. But it has been challenging this year, there have been a number of assets that have traded at prices that we didn\u2019t want to pay and we\u2019re also looking at a number of development sites as well. Ray? Ray Ritchey : Hey, listen, we came here at three years ago and we\u2019re now up to 2.5 million square feet. Current occupancy levels are in the high 90s. We\u2019ve come in second on three or four different other opportunities in LA. But we held on to our discipline and didn\u2019t overreach for those and we are actively considering three or four more opportunities right now. So, we are all in an LA for sure. And I\u2019d like to introduce John Lang, our LA Regional Manager, who is also on the call and John, anything else you want to add? John Lang : No, I would just add to it. To Owen\u2019s comment, there\u2019s been a lot of opportunities here in this past quarter, some of which are traded for pretty healthy pricing, but we\u2019re aggressive and we\u2019re seeking opportunities both the marketed and the non-marketed development and existing asset acquisitions, but we want to remain disciplined with our path to growth. Doug Linde : And I would just like to add that while we\u2019re very excited about the acquisitions of the real estate we have in that market. We\u2019re really excited about having John joined our team. He\u2019s only been with us over a year and he\u2019s already made a tremendous difference in our presence in the LA market and we\u2019re extremely grateful to have him. Jamie Feldman : Great. How would you say, now that you\u2019ve been there a while, how would you say, be it speak and differentiate itself in the market? What do you bring fresh to the market? Doug Linde : You\u2019re asking me or John? Jamie Feldman : Whoever would like to answer. Doug Linde : Okay. I would answer and John could comment that I think our outreach to the existing tenants in our portfolio, our outreach to community leaders, our ability to develop close relationships with brokers has distinguished us from the traditional development and landlord community in LA. And I think we\u2019re a little bit of a breath of fresh air to the LA market. John, would you care to comment on that? John Lang : Yes. I would reiterate all of those things. And Jamie, for you and a couple other folks that have recently been to Colorado Center. We\u2019re taking a very hands-on approach, not just with our relationships with our customers and our tenants, but with our physical improvements. So, we just rolled out the new public plaza here at Colorado Center. We\u2019ve got a new best-in-class food hall experience that\u2019s going to be opening here shortly. So, I think we\u2019re putting in the strategic capital here that\u2019s a little more thoughtful, and a little more strategic with what the tenants in today\u2019s world are demanding. So, Colorado Centers are great example of that and with Ray\u2019s help and with our kind of Cross Country collaboration and making sure that we are leveraging everyone\u2019s collective resources across our regions. Colorado center quickly went to 100% leased, in about two years since the acquisition and that was before all of the capital was deployed here and you can actually feel and see the improvements. So, I think that\u2019s a great success story and we\u2019re on the right path to do that at the Santa Monica Business Park as well. And just take a little bit more of a hands-on approach compared to some of the other owner and operators here. Jamie Feldman : Okay, great. That\u2019s a very helpful. Switching gears to Mike, can you \u2013 are you able to quantify some of the drags on earnings you mentioned rolling into 2020, like assuming your share count stays the same, maybe like pennies per share or some other way to think about it? Mike LaBelle : Well, I think Doug described some of the numbers. So, I think, Doug said, GM was $13 million and Reston was $17 million. So, those are kind of the big moves and we still believe we\u2019re going to be able to demonstrate growth in the same-store portfolio. Every year, we\u2019ve got rollouts, right? And then we try to explain them to them, what\u2019s renewing and what\u2019s rolling out? So, a lot of the stuff that is on the expiration table. We\u2019re in the process of renewing and we\u2019re working on those kinds of things. There are some where we know the tenants are going to leave. So these are the ones that are more sizable where we know they\u2019re going to leave to give you some sense for \u2013 to help you I guess, along the way. I can\u2019t tell you what our guidance is right now. It\u2019s honestly just too early. We still think it\u2019ll be positive. We just think there\u2019s a couple of things in there that will hamper a stronger growth profile. Jamie Feldman : Okay. Doug Linde : Okay. I just want to \u2013 I\u2019d like to give you sort of the following sort of framework, which is if you think about our year-to-year projections. What we\u2019ve described is, we are \u2013 it\u2019s not 100%, really close to 100% occupied both Boston and in San Francisco. And there\u2019s very limited rollover in those marketplaces and we\u2019re seeing very significant as I described, mark-to-mark least increases and therefore, increases in either our FFO, if there is a modest amount of build out time in our cash rents. We have our biggest exposures in 2020, which \u2013 and the reason I brought it up is, because we\u2019ve asked \u2013 been asked the question every single time we\u2019ve had a one-on-one meeting with anybody and we\u2019ve done a number of NDRs over the last quarter are the General Motors building in New York City and the Reston Town Center Market in Northern Virginia. That\u2019s the vast majority of our \u201cexposure\u201d and I tried to articulate what that exposure was. We believe that the power of San Francisco and the power of Boston are going to continue to overwhelm the other issues, but that there is some degree of pull down from that particular exposure, because that property is currently leased today. And then we have a few other negatives in terms of the properties that we\u2019re taking out of service, including as soon as we described the 325 Main Street, which is pulling $4 million out in 2020 and 2021. So, we tried to sort of give you a good roadmap for how you might think about your modeling of our portfolio on the revenue side, did you think about 2020 and 2021. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And those are revenue numbers, not NOI numbers? Doug Linde : Yes, revenue number. Jamie Feldman : GM investment? Doug Linde : Yes. Jamie Feldman : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Green with Evercore. Jason Green : Good morning. Just a quick question on the Boston market. The Boston Seaport is kind of the only major Boston submarket, you\u2019re not in currently. Is that a submarket we could see you enter or does it not necessarily fit the profile what you guys look for in assets? Mike LaBelle : We continue to look at it just like every other market is part of our core markets, it\u2019s definitely part of the Boston core market. It\u2019s just a matter of finding the right opportunity. I would comment to echo what Doug\u2019s been talking about with tenant inspired play on renewals. The seaports interesting, if you take one specific asset out that is caught on the edge of worse things happening, it\u2019s like a 2.3% vacancy, which is incredibly low. And then in that greater call at Boston market, we\u2019re looking at everything, submarkets in the 6% range. So, it\u2019s really interesting that each of these markets is a firing on all cylinders right now. And a lot of it has to do with echoing what Doug and OT talked about was incredible discipline right now at least for the time being in terms of development coming on with significant pre-leasing and that still bodes well as we look at the forecast for the next couple of years, as we look at the developable sites, all of them have significant pre-leased play on them. Jason Green : Got it. And then maybe just switching over to Reston, as the government continues to talk about housing reform and potentially some changes to Fannie Mae, is there any risk to the lease at Reston Town Center and given the company moving into what might be viewed as relatively expensive space might not be perceived the right way? Ray Ritchey : You\u2019re talking about risk relative to the credit of the tenant, right? Doug Linde : It was a legal risk \u2013 it\u2019s a legal risk. Ray Ritchey : So, we have a binding lease with the agency or the NGO or NGA. And our understanding of all the discussions that are going on in Washington DC have to do with the future of how mortgages are securitized. I believe that the bonds that have been issued by both Freddie and Fannie go well beyond the least that we have at Reston, which is, I think 12 years starting in 2022. So, we are not concerned on a cash basis in terms of receiving our rent from the tenant. What happens to that organization and how that organization is ultimately changed relative to the way the private mortgage market works. I think that\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess and in 2035, it could be an issue. Jason Green : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And we have time for one final question, and that question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Alexander Goldfarb : Yes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. Mike, just quickly going back to some of the items that you mentioned for next year. You mentioned that $13 million coming out of the GM Building, if $10 million in size, is that in addition to the $13 million? So in effect it\u2019s a $23 impact of 2020 from the GM Building coming out? Mike LaBelle : Yes. That\u2019s in addition to the $13 million, that\u2019s a non-cash front. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. Okay. And then the 540 Madison is in guidance or that\u2019s not in guidance or it closes so late in the year that it\u2019s really immaterial to the share. Mike LaBelle : The 540 Madison Avenue was not in guidance, because we don\u2019t have any kind of agreement on it. It\u2019s picked on the market at this point. So, the only sale is the Tower Center sale that we announced that is in the guidance. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then just finally, just thinking about funding for your pipeline, you were clear that equity issuances is last in your list, but it seems like between free cash flow that $200 million to $400 million of dispose that you guys think about. And then Jay being on new \u2013 on sort of new projects, it seems like you guys have found a pretty good balance for funding developments going forward. So, the big dispositions that would sort of the loop growth in the past, it seems like you guys have now gotten your funding model to a pretty good way, where you don\u2019t sort of have that anymore. Is that a fair way to look at it? Mike LaBelle : I think that\u2019s true, Alex, our selling program that we have been going through the last five years. I mean raising capital is a nice outcome, but the real reason is we\u2019re selling assets that are non-core to the company going forward. So, we still \u2013 we\u2019ll have some of those in future years. But I agree with what you\u2019re saying. I think that we have between our own resources and the resources of a growing list of capital partners, we will \u2013 we are not capital constrained in terms of making new investments. Owen Thomas : And the other thing that we focused on Alex is our leverage. So right now, our leverage is at six and a half times, since conservative are \u2013 we don\u2019t want to be north of seven. If you look at the pipeline we have today and new pro forma were below six. So, there\u2019s a lot of room there for us to work, which is why we\u2019re comfortable using a good amount of debt for some of this. And then we bring in partners on some of this, just linked in that capability of that existing balance sheet to continue to work. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay, okay. Thank you. Owen Thomas : Okay, sure. Operator, are we all set, that\u2019s the end of the question? Operator : Yes. I will now turn the call back over to you guys for closing remarks. Owen Thomas : Okay. Thank you very much for all of your interest in Boston Properties. That includes the questions and our remarks. Thank you very much. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s Boston Properties conference call. Thank you again for attending and have a good day.",

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks. Owen Thomas : Thank you, Sara and good morning everyone. We had another quarter of accomplishments and continue to execute successfully on our revenue and earnings growth strategy. Let me start with key financial highlights. In terms of FFO per share growth this year we continue to outperform every Company in our sector and a vast majority of REITs overall. This past quarter, we grew FFO per share of 13% over the second quarter of 2018, which was also $0.04 per share above the midpoint of our guidance for the quarter and $0.04 above the street. Our share of cash same property NOI growth was also very strong at 9% for the quarter. We also raised our full year 2019 FFO per share guidance by $0.06 at the midpoint, which would result in 12% FFO growth year-over-year, again, well ahead of peers. We increased occupancy for our in-service office and retail portfolio 50 basis points from last quarter to 93.4%. This also marks a 300 basis point increase from a year ago and our highest occupancy in over five years. Our growth is well balanced coming from both delivery of new developments and same-property performance. And in terms of operational highlights we had a busy and productive quarter. We completed over 2.4 million square feet of leasing, which is well above our long-term quarterly average for the period. We began construction of 225 Main Street in Cambridge for Google Hub on Causeway is starting to come online as Rapid7 moves in and the retail components activate in our podium first phase and we completed Boston Properties' second green bond offering raising $150 million at attractive terms in the unsecured debt market. So let me transition to business conditions. Our primary lens on the economy is leasing activity which remains vibrant throughout the vast majority of our portfolio. In fact, markets, driven by technology and life science demand are experiencing historic highs in rents and leasing activity. Through the lens of reported economic data the US economy also appears healthy with 2.1% GDP growth in the second quarter so that was down from 3.1% in the first quarter, 512,000 jobs were created in the second quarter, there was a 3.7% unemployment rate and inflation is in check at 1.6%. Notwithstanding this favorable backdrop, the Fed has turned increasingly dovish and is signaling a potential interest rate cut because of risks, they see in the economy, which also has our attention. Growth outside the US has slowed with China reporting its weakest numbers in 27 years in Germany is manufacturing sector which accounts for a large portion of its economy is in a deepening recession. As a result, central banks around the world are turning accommodative. There are also geopolitical risks, including a US trade war with China, no deal Brexit and tensions in the Middle East. Lastly in the US growth has become more narrow and consumer reliance and corporate earnings were also down modestly in 2019. So what does all this mean for Boston Properties? We are not calling for a recession near term, but clearly the global and US economies are slowing and recession risks as a result are rising. Central bank action in the US and around the world should help and low interest rates are a clear tailwind for commercial real estate demand evaluation. We are cautiously bullish and continue to actively pursue and selectively make new investment. So we are considering a number of investments in all our core markets. We are more enthusiastic about taking incremental risks in our markets, driven by technology and life science demand, including most of our Boston and San Francisco Bay Area footprint, West LA, segments of New York City and Northern Virginia. That all being said Boston Properties is hedged and well prepared for a downturn, if and when in emerging. Our corporate leverage remains modest. We are completing new leases and early renewing a large number of tenants. Our weighted average in-service lease term is approximately eight years, and rising. And our development pipeline has modest risks given the buildings under construction are 81% pre-leased. Now moving to the private real estate capital market for assets in our core markets. It remains strong and liquid. Every on market transaction we have pursued this year either buildings for sites has been hotly competitive with multiple qualified investors. There are many very large institutional investors globally interested in making private equity real estate investments across sectors and geographies. Significant office transaction volume in the US ended the second quarter at $25.4 billion, which is up 42.3% from last quarter and up -- over 24% from a year ago. Yet again there are numerous significant asset transactions in our markets this past quarter. Starting in Boston a 90% leasehold interest in Ombudsman triangle in Cambridge, sold for $1.1 billion, which is about 16.50 a square foot and a 4.3% cap rate, this is a 680,000 square foot office and lab complex that is fully leased and sold to a joint venture of a private equity investment manager and a local operator. The seller retain the freehold interest. In West LA Culver creative campus sold for $260 million or $920 a square foot, and a 4.8% cap rate this is a 280,000 square foot creative office property that's fully leased and sold to a fund manager. Moving to San Francisco 650 towns and in the Mission Bay Districts sold for just under $700 million, which is a 1,040 a square foot, and a 5 cap this is a 670,000 square foot office building, that's fully leased sold to a private real estate investment firm. And then finally, Washington DC, a 49% interest in Trail Place is under agreement to sell for $475 million, about 1,050 a square foot, and just under a 5 cap. This is a 451,000 square foot office building 95% leased sold to a sovereign wealth fund. So sticking with dispositions we are targeting approximately $300 million in asset sales this year and are well on our way to achieving this goal having completed $251 million in dispositions year-to-date. Notably, this quarter we closed on the sale of 540, Madison Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, of which we earned a 60% interest. Our partners in the project exercise their right to sell their 40% interest in the asset and we elected to join them to market the entire building. After seeing significant interest in the property, we closed on the sale of the 284,000 square feet office building to an advisor on behalf of the US pension fund for $310 million which is $1092 per square foot and a 3.8% yield on current NOI state which stabilizes at 4.5%. The pricing was very attractive to us relative to the growth potential we saw on the asset, given its market position. The sale also served as an opportunity to prune our New York City portfolio at the same time we are reinvesting in our 53rd Street campus and the GM Building. And lastly, of course, asset sales and operate capital for our development pipeline and other new investment. The competitive process we experienced during the sale renewed our confidence in the depth of the market for Midtown Manhattan office buildings, particularly for assets of this scale. Moving to other capital activities development continues to be our primary strategy for creating value for shareholders, and our pipeline of current and future developments remains robust. As mentioned, this quarter we added 325 Main Street in Kendall Center to our development pipeline, representing an additional $418 million and expected investment. Not only does this development, grow our relationship with Google, an important client, we also extended our other leases with Google, creating an 850,000 square feet relationship across 3 buildings in Cambridge through 2037. With this addition, our current development pipeline stands at 12 office and residential developments and redevelopments, comprising 5.7 million square feet and $3.2 billion of investment for our share. The commercial component of this portfolio is 81% pre-leased and aggregate projected cash yields are approximately 7%. We also expect to add 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue to the development pipeline next quarter. This 480,000 square feet building with 66% of the office space pre-leased will add an estimated 360 million in investment. Most of the development pipeline is well underway and we have $1.5 billion of capital remaining to fund. Given selected asset sales the scheduled delivery of our current development pipeline and forecast NOI growth from our in-service portfolio we anticipate being able to fund the current development pipeline without either accessing the public equity markets or increasing our leverage ratios. As we pursue and add additional new investment opportunities to the pipeline we will be increasingly accessing private equity partners to extend the use of our equity capital and hence our returns. For example, we are close to completing a joint venture with a private capital partner for our platform 16 future development project in San Jose. So to conclude, tenant demand remains robust in our core markets companies across sectors continue to make long-term commitments to our high quality properties, allowing them to attract and retain talent with leading edge workspaces and amenities. Financially, we are delivering the highest FFO per share growth in our sector and among most REITs overall this year, well, while maintaining modest levels of leverage. Our focus on new development has been and will continue to be our differentiator and advantage, allowing us to drive strong growth and returns and create long-term value for shareholders. And given our robust current development pipeline and new investments under pursue coupled with our strong balance sheet and available financial resources, we are confident of continued growth and value creation in the years ahead. And I will turn it over to Doug. Doug Linde : Thanks, Owen, good morning everybody. Last quarter we described pretty healthy leasing activity across all of our markets, except the District of Columbia, and to the extent that there have been adjustments to these conditions over the past 90 days, the changes have been positive expressed in the form of more active requirements, more early renewals, and more tenant growth. While the slowdown in global economic growth and the trade dispute Owen referenced are impacting sectors of the economy, the tenants in our buildings and the tenants that are considering new space in our markets are showing great resiliency or have not been impacted to the extent that their behaviors when it comes to using space to attract, recruit, and retain employees remained constant. We are not seeing tenants put requirements on hold move to short-term decisions or list based on the sublet market. The demographics of the labor markets, the tight unemployment rate for the workforce with college or graduate degrees and the continued changes to how businesses workforce will be impacted from technological innovation are creating continued demand for our markets in our buildings. The demand is as Owen said is driven by growth from technology, life science media, but also some financial service tenants. In San Francisco, CBRE reported in 2013 that tech made up about 22% of the embedded occupied market or about 15 million square feet, As of the end of the second quarter of 2019 Tech made up 38% of the market and 31 million square feet. In Midtown Manhattan in 2010, CBRE reported at 5.5% of the market, were 70.6 million square feet was occupied by technology companies. At the end of the first quarter of '19 the texture had increased to 8.8 million, 8.8% or 32.5 million square feet and this excludes jobs in traditional financial service organizations like banks that have significant technology employment. There is more tech occupancy in New York then there isn't San Francisco. As we said at the NAREIT Conference in June, the technology leasing, we have seen in Manhattan over the past few years is obscured by the size of the market and the significant speculative supply that has been delivered. Demand in Manhattan remains robust. At this moment, there are at least four technology companies in active discussions on requirements of between 400,000 and a 1.5 million square feet and they represent significant growth for each tenant. In addition, there are a dozen non-technology firms, law firms, banks, media companies, insurance companies with requirements in excess of 300,000 square feet that are seriously considering our relocation to either new construction or renovated product. Some of these non-tech clients are growing in others they are contracting their footprint, but on balance, demand remains strong. Interest in new development, including our project at 3 Hudson Boulevard has picked up. Large blocks in the new product, which is in almost every case, price, it's starting rents in excess of $100 a square foot are leasing up more quickly than we anticipated. There will still be significant existing supply from known relocations. So while we are optimistic about the shrinking availability of newly constructed space in the medium term, we continue to have a cautious view of transaction economics over the next few years. Boston Properties has one lease expiration in excess of 150,000 square feet during the next 5 years in our Manhattan portfolio and we are in the renewal discussions with that tenant today. Our portfolio in New York focus remains at the General Motors Building and our remaining block at 399 Park Avenue. We completed a lease on one floor at the GM this quarter. The high-end market. The final space with starting rents in excess of $120 a square foot really hasn't changed much over the last 90 days. As I said previously, leasing activity in this submarket is not about incremental price or concessions, it's simply about a smaller demand pool and that demand remains light today. I describe the economic impact of our known 2020 Manhattan availability last quarter and it hasn't changed. We have about $13 million of income in 2019 from space that is expiring in 2020 at the GM Building. When combined with the currently vacant space here in a 399 Park, we should see future revenue of about $27 million from those spaces. I also want to note that at 1590 E 53rd Street we will be collecting cash rent in November of '19 on a 195,000 square feet. But as we sit here in July, our incoming tenant has yet to begin their improvement construction, which means they are unlikely to be completed in 2019 and this will push our revenue recognition date into 2020. Dock 72 is expected to open in September for we work and we expect to open the amenity space in October. We continue to have some tenant discussions, but there are no imminent lease signings in our sector. In Northern Virginia, we're almost 10% of the company NOI originate the tech tenants that have identified the DC Metro employment as a fertile area for growth are continuing to grow. In addition, the contractors that service defense and homeland security are expanding the demand picture is robust. In Reston Town Center, we have active lease discussions involving 285,000 square feet with 7 tenants that includes a 160,000 square feet of positive absorption to take up the space, we're getting back in 2020. We have three other technology and defense contractors that currently occupy 85,000 square feet looking at 63,000 square feet of expansion in early stage discussion. We have a new leasing leader in DC, Jake Stralman, and he and his team are aggressively working to cover that 2020 availability. Just west of the town center, a few weeks ago the team completed a 15 year renewal with a defense related government entity for 492,000 square feet. We anticipated this renewal and it's not part of the known availability in Reston. In Boston, we're operating in a market where there is very limited availability, the vacancy rate is stated under 6% fully committed build-to-suit seem to be announced every quarter at this time it's a raw subsidiary for more than 575,000 square feet part lab and part office. The speculative portions of new construction aren't delivering until 2022 or later and there are very few blocks of contiguous space. New construction rents are close to $100 on a gross basis. In Cambridge the availability rate is even lower under 2% and even with the departure of tenants moving to new construction in Boston or the western suburbs office rents are over $90 triple-net and labyrinth are over $100 triple net with a higher TI Allowance. In Waltham Lexington, the growth in migration of lab tenants has resulted in over 1 million square feet of new requirements in this market with less than a million square feet of available product which -- most of which was converted office space. This has pushed office rents for older space into the mid '40s growth and new construction into the mid '50s. Our Boston CBD portfolio is 99% leased and hence the majority of our CBD portfolio activity involves expansions and early renewals at higher rents. At 200 Clarence Street year-to-date Pat Mobinil, who has recently taken over the leadership of the Boston leasing region and his team have completed 118,000 square feet including 75,000 square feet of 2022 early renewals this year and they are currently negotiating leases for another 140,000 square feet of 2022 expirations with existing tenants, including 34,000 square feet of expansion. Our largest ongoing transaction at the Prudential Center involve the recapture of a floor from one tenant along with an immediate release to a growing financial services firm that is also committing to two additional floors in late 2023. To date in 2019 we've completed 775,000 square feet of Boston CBD deals on an existing space with an average increase in rents up 21% on a gross basis. In the development pipeline, in addition to increasing our pre-leasing at 100 Causeway with the lease for 67,000 square feet we have two other leases in negotiation totaling 77,000 square feet which when signed would bring pre-leasing to 93%. Last quarter, I described our plans to terminate leases in anticipation of converting 200 West Street to a lab infrastructure starting in the fourth quarter that's a Waltham suburban properties. And this in fact is happening. Hence, the decline in occupancy this quarter. Occupancy will drop as we vacate 50% of the building to enable the lab conversion. We'll be investing about $40 million on the Apple Google square footage to convert the base building systems, provide enhanced TI transaction costs, and carry the development while the space is out of service. Lab rents are between $48 and $63 triple-net in the Waltham Lexington market. We expect the high single, if not double-digit return on this incremental investment. As we permit and draw our new suburban product, it is all being designed as lab ready. 180 City Point our next development site in Waltham is a 300,000 square feet building that's fully permitted that fits this store. We recently made 180,000 square feet proposal to a lab user and 120,000 square feet proposal to an office user for the same building. We have a few additional known move out in Waltham in 2019 and we are reviewing whether these buildings can also support a lab conversion. Similar to Boston, San Francisco has a vacancy rate in the low single digits. While we can point to significant future development opportunities in the Boston market in San Francisco, the issues with propane and [indiscernible] create a much more constrained situation. Nothing has changed with the sequel litigation involving the Central solar plan but the city has move forward and approved LPA's large project authorizations for 598 Brandon the tennis club and -- sites and subsequently authorize partial Prop M allocations. The city is currently processing our LPA for fourth in Harrison and we expect to formally go before the Planning Commission in the fall and receive our LPA and Prop M allocation for 500,000 square feet, a partial allocation. Recently a [indiscernible] was proposed for the March 2020 election that would allow for a full Prop M allocation for the current Central summer super block sites including ours but TI future allocations to citywide affordable housing goals, further tightening future supply of office space in the city. The vacancy rate in San Francisco is at its lowest level since this last cycle began after the great financial crisis. Our city portfolio ended the quarter at 93% occupied, but we have expiring leases for 285,000 square feet that have not commenced that would bring it to 98% occupied. This quarter, we completed 160,000 square feet of leasing at Embarcadero Center. To date in 2019 we've completed 435,000 square feet with an average gross rent increase of 34%. If a tenant wants a full floor receipt, he has one option prior to July of 2020. We have only one multi-floor expiration prior to the end of '21, but if a tenant is looking for an available block of space, a good comparable to the Embarcadero Center or other properties we have is the low-rise at 101 market with an asking rent for that block starting at over $100 a square foot. We have a large portfolio development opportunities in the Silicon Valley. This market continues to experience strong growth led by Google, Apple, Facebook. Google recently purchased the former Yahoo campus from Verizon and Verizon has leased 650,000 square feet in close proximity to the Caltrans station in Santa Clara and Uber has taken 300,000 square feet in Sunnyvale again close to a Caltrans station. We are aware of other San Francisco headquartered companies that are looking in the valley for large blocks of space as well as value companies, continuing to grow. At Platform 16 in San Jose we are enabling the site and making presentations to tenants that are looking for large blocks of space. In our existing Mountain View prior portfolio, we continue to release or renew space at rents in excess of $60 triple net for single-storey product. This quarter we completed three leases for 130,000 square feet with an average rental increase of over 90% on the net rents. So to summarize, New York, the headline is that the market is active and our growth is going to be driven by the lease up of our limited high end space availability. In DC, we're making good progress with leasing our 2020 availability in Reston. In Boston and San Francisco, the strong rental growth along with occupancy increases is really what's driving our overall portfolio performance. When we add the contribution from our $3.2 billion development pipeline, which will deliver in '19, '20, '21, '22 and '23 we are excited about our continued growth prospects. I'll stop here and turn it over to Mike. Mike LaBelle : Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. As Owen described, we had another strong quarter. We increased our full-year FFO guidance again and we're now projecting 12% year-over-year FFO growth at the midpoint. Before I get into the financial results, I would like to touch a little on our capital raising, because we've been very active in the capital markets, raising capital through both debt issuances and property sales. We raised $150 million with the sales of 540, Madison Avenue and two smaller non-core suburban assets this quarter. We raised $850 million in the bond market in June with our second 10-year green bond at a very attractive 3.4% fixed interest rate. We also closed on $255 million of construction financing for the Marriott headquarters development where we have a 50% joint venture interest. And we are in the final stages of closing a $400 million construction financing to fund the development of our 50-50 joint venture 100 Causeway Street office development in Boston. We now have over $1 billion of cash on hand, plus our full $1.5 billion credit facility available. We are in a strong position to fund the remaining $1.5 billion of costs to complete our development pipeline which totaled $3.2 billion of total investment. We continue to have no need to issue public equity to complete our pipeline and we expect that our overall leverage currently at a reasonable 6.3 times net debt to EBITDA will improve as these projects deliver. We are pleased with our balance sheet and our ability to maintain modest leverage and strong liquidity while funding a growing development pipeline that will drive future growth and shareholder return. Now, let's get into the details for the quarter. Our second quarter results were strong and exceeded our expectations with revenue up 10% and FFO up 13% respectively over last year. We again demonstrated gains in our portfolio occupancy up 50 basis points and now at 93.4%, and the roll-up in our replacement rents was outstanding, up 25% on a net basis over the prior lease on approximately 600,000 square feet of leasing of leasing that commenced this quarter. Our FAD this quarter came in at $224 million, which is an improvement over last quarter's results due to higher revenues and lower leasing costs. This provides a strong dividend coverage with an FAD payout ratio of 73%. Our FFO for the second quarter was $1.78 per share, it exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.04 per share or about $7 million dollars, $0.02 per share of our beat came primarily from higher portfolio revenues where we commenced 2 leases earlier than our prior projections. We also gained $0.02 per share from lower operating expenses. This consisted of repair and maintenance items not completed as quickly as we expected, we anticipate incurring these expenses in the back half of the year. So of this quarter's $0.04 per share earnings beat only $0.02 per share will benefit the full year. This quarter our share of same-property NOI is up 7.6% and on a cash basis of 9% coming from a combination of increases in occupancy and achieving higher rents as we release our expiring spaces. We anticipate that this growth rate will not be as high in the back half of 2019 partially due to higher comparable periods in the second half of 2018. We also project our occupancy to moderate for the rest of 2019 due to pending explorations primarily in suburban Boston and suburban San Francisco where we will see some downtime before new leases come in. We expect our occupancy to hover around 93% for the rest of the year. For the full year 2019, our assumptions include growth in our share of same-property NOI of 6% to 6.75% over 2018. This represents an increase of 25 basis points at the midpoint from our guidance last quarter and it's from the combination of the revenue out performance in the second quarter and continued strong leasing activity in most of our markets. We have activity on nearly all of our available space in San Francisco and we're working on a number of early renewals at higher rents in Boston, New York City, and West LA. At the end of the second quarter we sold by 540, Madison Avenue for $310 million of which we owned 60%. The loss of our share of the NOI for the next 6 months is $3.1 million or $0.02 per share to our 2019 full year projections. We transferred the mortgage on the property so our share of interest expense will be $1 million lower, we've also reduced our net interest expense assumptions due to higher cash balances from asset sales, lower interest rates, the impact of our bond deal as well as changes in the timing of our development funding. We expect net interest expense for the year of $398 million to $410 million, a reduction of $8 million at the midpoint from our guidance last quarter. And we have modestly increased our fee income projections by $2 million at the midpoint, coming from higher projected construction management fees. So overall, we are increasing our 2018 guidance for funds from operations by $0.06 per share at the midpoint, to a new range of $7.02 to $7.08 per share. The increase consists of $0.02 per share from higher projected portfolio NOI $0.05 per share from lower net interest expense, $0.01 per share from higher fee revenue offset by the loss of $0.02 per share in NOI from the sale of 540 Madison Avenue. In summary, we are projecting an industry leading 12% FFO growth in 2019 at the midpoint of our guidance range. We are executing effectively in the leasing markets, which is driving strong organic growth through increases in occupancy and locking in higher rents as leases roll. Given our higher starting occupancy revenue level our 2020 organic growth will likely not match the roughly 6.4% same property NOI growth and 200 basis points of occupancy gain that we project this year. However, the portfolio continues to offer opportunity for 2020 growth by capturing incremental occupancy as well as a positive mark to market on near-term expiring leases. We also have a substantial pipeline of developments that are now 81% pre-leased and will contribute to our growth in 2020 and for multiple years beyond. That completes our formal remarks. Operator, can you open the line for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Nick Yulico : Thanks. Owen, you talked about how the macro environment is slowing and get asset pricing is still very strong. So I guess I'm wondering how that changes your thinking on capital allocation. Does this mean we'll see more JV capital for new developments you start, you did mentioned San Jose is a candidate there or maybe and how are you thinking about sales of buildings or JV stakes in the core portfolio? Owen Thomas : Yeah. So let me break that question down talk about sales and then talk about new investments. I think on sales I know on sales we're going to continue to sell non-core assets as we've done successfully, and I would say, fairly aggressively over the last few years and that's been always in the kind of a $100 to $300 million range. And then -- our core assets are not being sold but from time to time something opportunistic presents itself as it did with 540 Madison and we certainly want to take advantage of that. On the new investments. I'm not sure there's going to be a big change we are -- we will continue to not be purchasing stabilized assets in our marketplace which, I give these examples every quarter, and I can pick a deal or 2 out in almost every one of our cities that trades at a 4% cap rate and that's dilutive to what we're trying to do and those kinds of opportunities don't have the same growth that our development opportunity do so we're not focused on buying core assets. But relative to that interest rate environment and relative to that cap rate environment, we continue to add new developments through our pipeline that are approaching or at 7% cash yields, which we think are very accretive to shareholders, both from a NOI perspective and NAV perspective. And then lastly, on your question about JV partners, we are spending more time in the private capital markets, we are meeting new partners that we've entered into a number of joint ventures. Recently we -- I talked about platform 16. That decision is really more about our willing -- our ability to fund. As we mentioned, we don't want to issue our equity given our share price. We don't want to increase our leverage, given where we are with the economy. So if our investment pipeline exceeds our financial resources given those constraints that's when the financial private equity partners get introduced and that's been our logic on. Nick Yulico : All right, that's helpful. I just -- one other question is, you've mentioned how 2020 is -- there are some items in 2020 that create some slowing in same store growth move-outs, GM, some other buildings that are known. But I guess, can you remind us about how you can what the benefit could be to next year, if you've got some of the vacancy leased this year at 399 Park and GM, how that could actually then be a benefit to 2020? Doug Linde : Sure. So, this is Doug. The reality of the situation, just to be perfectly blunt, is that the space at 399 is in a sale condition. And so, if we do at least today in all likelihood there won't be a build out for a significant period of time in 2020 but net -- the space that is available today and the space that is rolling over in the General Motors Building would have a positive contribution of about $27 million and we currently have $13 million from that pool of assets today. So you can divide by 12 months and figure out what -- how you want to think about that. And then the other major exposure we have is we have, I said this before, in excess of 0.5 million square feet of known expirations in our restaurant portfolio in the beginning of 2020 and the average rent is about $50 a square foot. So you can put a number of about $25 million on that. So there is a higher probability of us getting some of that back sooner, because we have tenants that are in some of that space that are expanding and we have some -- we have space that is currently build out and ready for occupancy and therefore we can recognize revenue earlier. So that's, those are the sort of the 2 big building block. One more thing, and the other thing which is important is that we have cash revenue at 1590 East 53rd Street and because that's when our leases they have to start, but they have been delayed in their planning and their construction documents for the 195,000 square feet and you'll notice in our, our supplemental, we pushed out the stabilization date because we just were a little unsure as to right now as to when they're going to complete their build out of that space, and so that will impact our 2020 numbers off. Nick Yulico : Okay . I guess, just one follow-up here. There is just any commentary on how the leasing is going, discussions are going for that remaining space at 399 and GM that you're trying to get done? Owen Thomas : John, do you want to cover that? John Powers : Yeah. We have a good action on trade 399. We've got some proposals and some people going back and forth. Some of it for 4.5 or a 4. So I think we'll make progress on that this year. GM we have a number of prospects for this space, some of them are looking hard at the market and this is a little more supply in the market on the high end then there has been in the past. Thanks everyone. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi. Manny Korchman : Hey, good morning everyone. Maybe Owen or Doug on 3 Hudson remind us, given the amount of demand in a number of large tenants looking for space. What level of pre-leasing do you have to be at to get the project started or is that high level of demand giving you the confidence to go more spec on that better? Owen Thomas : Manny we've answered this question in the past. Let me talk a little bit about the building and then I'll talk about the pre-leasing. So as Doug described, there is a lot of activity, a very positive activity in the marketplace both from new requirements from tech companies but also more traditional companies relocating. We've been very encouraged by the level of activity that we're seeing and we've been very encouraged by how the market has been receiving our offering. It's an exciting building and again it's being well received. We won't start the property without a very significant pre-lease. We are not going to state a specific number. Manny Korchman : Okay. And then Mike, the expenses being delayed, are those the same expenses that was delayed last quarter and how do we think about how they're actually going to come in for the rest of the year? Mike LaBelle : I don't necessarily think it was the same expenses that were delayed last quarter, but it is typically this R&M item that our property management teams have I think they're just conservatively projected these things. And then I think the time of year, when most of the stuff gets done is kind of later in the year third quarter is a very, big period for that. So I would think that the third quarter expenses are seasonally higher anyway. And I think that much of this will be pushed into the third quarter. However, I think that some of it may drip also into the fourth quarter, but I do expect it all to get done in 2019. So I don't expect to see kind of savings associated with some of the stuff just dropping off. Manny Korchman : Great. And one final one from me. The LA second generation cash rent spreads were negative I realize it's on a small amount of space. Is there something specific with that space or is there something broader going on in sort of your submarkets there? Owen Thomas : There is nothing broader going on. The reason I didn't talk about LA this quarter mainly it was because we are --- all we're doing right now is the large renewal discussions and we have very little available space and interestingly I think the one thing about the Santa Monica Business Park, which by the way is we're all that space came from is that we're actually seeing lower transaction costs than we anticipated, because we're talking about basically five to seven year renewals, which probably is the right thing for us given the relative issues associated with the ground lease and the repositioning of the property. Manny Korchman : Thanks everyone. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Thank you. Actually just sticking with Santa Monica, there was a discussion on another call about Snap downsizing their New York presence and I'm wondering if there's a similar situation in your portfolio. Owen Thomas : Our interaction with Snap that the Santa Monica is our business park is that there, they're going to sequentially through all of their must take space and they're building it out and occupying it. John Kim : Okay. GM Building retail, I think the last official update you provided a couple of calls ago is that Apple moving in the first half of this year, has that delay impacted cash NOI at all and if you could just provide an update? Owen Thomas : No, it hasn't impacted our cash NOI. Apple is at the very, late at latter stages of opening the store. And I think we're excited about what that's going to do not only for the retail, but for the environment on the corner of 59th Street and 5th Avenue, which has been a rather laborious construction site for the past couple of years and we're excited to have it all come to a conclusion. John Kim : Final question from me is that [indiscernible]. John Powers : This is John. I would just say the store is spectacular when it opened you all have to come to see it. It's going to be amazing. John Kim : And just on that, when is Under Armour, when you expect Under Armour is open? Owen Thomas : Right now we expect Under Armour to take possession of the space sometime in early 2020 and there we expect that there'll be working on their plans and opening hopefully before the end of the year. But we -- again that we're just -- we're not aware specifically what their timing is and how that vis-a-vis deals with their product launches and their store openings and their seasonal issues. So we just don't know. John Kim : And then final one and that shall make two, I think last quarter you were, you mentioned interest is picking up. It doesn't sound like you're as bullish on leasing prospects this quarter, I don't know if that's accurate, but can you provide an update? And also what is the impact to 2020 FFO would be at that asset? Owen Thomas : So I'll start and I will let John comment. I would say that the reason that you're not hearing me be more bullish than I was last quarters because the tenants that we're talking to last quarter are the same times we're talking to this quarter there aren't any additional ones. And so things are just sort of being drawn out. Our assumptions for the revenue pickup for that building assume a pretty prolong lease up, which is why we extended out the stabilization last quarter to sometime in 2021. Mike LaBelle : And obviously the space has to be built out, so recognize revenue on those future tenants until they build out their space. So we work is building out their space now so we will get some incremental benefit in 2020 from that space, but other space would need to be leased and built out. So Doug says we've kind of elongated the revenue projections for some of that. John Kim : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Craig Mailman : Hey, good morning guys. Maybe just going back to your commentary in the private equity partners for JVs. Could you just discuss kind of the appetite and you know of them four different stages of development, how you guys view kind of the right time to bring them in, to maximize the value creation and not give away too much of the upside? Owen Thomas : I think, it's a good question. I think, look, there is, as I mentioned in my comments, I think there is very significant capital available for commercial real estate generally some of that is interested in office. And then even among that demand not all of it will go into development, some of it's more core, core plus, some of it is more value add and some of it wants development. So you have to kind of parse it but there's clearly interest in development. Our view is on a project like Dock 72 excuse me on Platform 16 that we're bringing in the joint venture partner, in that case we recently bought the site and we bought it entitled so we paid for entitled site. So that risk is not there. So the risk is in the leasing. So I think what you'll see in those kinds of deals is the joint venture partners are introduced more or less at our basis because they're taking the same risks along with us. If we had a development site that that we had owned for a long time and we had guided and entitled and we had done some of the pre-leasing and we decided to introduce a partner, we would expect to bring that partner at a higher basis, because a lot of the risks had been mitigated and we had created the value and we would expect to be paid for that upfront. I would say most of the JV partners that we're talking to in development they probably don't want to come in at the, I would call the venture capital stage, which is when both the project needs, both entitlement and tenants. I think they are more interested in coming in later stages of these projects. Doug Linde : And Craig, the other thing I would say about joint ventures, particularly with development is that we are creating significant value and we are not doing this on a Perry pass through pro rata basis. We are putting ourselves in a position where, to the extent that we're successful we're being paid for that success in one form or another. So the old -- old story or the old challenge is would you rather have 10% of an asset that's yielding 25% return or drive a 100% of an asset that's yielding 10%. Right. And if you could do the same amount of the 25% obviously rather do that, but you can't. And so we think long and hard about JVs and the ability to put ourselves in a position where we can enhance our return on equity for the shareholder. But if, in fact, we're going to use 3rd-party capital and we're going to be a great fiduciary for institutional investors. Craig Mailman : Great, thanks for that. And then just second, Doug, you kind of touched on some expirations in Waltham, could we have some more opportunities for conversions. Could you give us just a sense of dollar amounts, and timing of when that could come your way? Doug Linde : Sure, so we're 200 West Street is likely to start in the 3rd -- 3rd or 4th quarter. And that is going to be about a 12 month project to complete the base building work and as well as the TI work and so that's a 2019-2020 project. We're also getting back on 195 West Street in August or September of this year. And that's another asset that is being looked at hard for lab usages and depending upon how quickly and how committed we are with the order West we will probably start that one as well and then we also have some space up at Bay Colony that is available and it potentially has the opportunity to be lab converted as well. Interestingly, we had a lab conversion that was done a number of years ago and that tenant was called Juno Therapeutics and they chose to sublet the space we actually recaptured it and released it and got a $20 premium from the existing tenant that was rolling over. So we clearly have a demand opportunity in the Waltham suburbs for these kinds of assets that will work very effectively and efficiently for both the lab and offices. Craig Mailman : So it will total like $100, $120 million in total for those 3? Doug Linde : If we did all three of them, it would be somewhere in that area, yeah. Craig Mailman : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Blaine Heck : Thanks, good morning. Doug, you sounded much more positive on Manhattan, can you or John just more generally speak to the market rent growth you're expecting in Manhattan, over the next 12 months and whether that expectation has gotten higher recently with the activity you're seeing on the demand side or is the supply is still at a level that it's going to keep kind of that rent growth muted. Doug Linde : So my view is and I'll let John express his and it may be slightly different is that there is the demand growth is what is going to result in as a I quicker opportunity for there to be growth in the market, but there is not growth in the market today. So we are not asking or receiving any more or less than we were receiving six months ago at 399 Park Avenue, or the General Motors Building, it's still a competitive market and as the move-outs occur there will be more availability. But there is no question that the reduction of the new supply or the highly well -- well regarded renovated supply has diminished and so rent for new construction and for those types of assets are going up. John. John Powers : Yeah, leasing activity is very good in the market, but we still have excess supply coming on and as Doug said there is a preference in the market clearly for new product or a renovated product. So we have, we're having a little bit of a skewed situation in the market with the availability rate pretty constant, but different supply characteristics in different types of products. Net right now net, we haven't seen prices move up with that we are holding and there are limited opportunities in the market when tenants look for space. If a large law firm is looking for space now in Midtown let's say 400,000 square feet or so that maybe have one alternative or two alternatives. So still limited supply in certain areas and strong leasing velocity. Blaine Heck : All right. That's very helpful. And then I wanted to touch real quick on acquisitions in LA in particular it seems like we've seen more deals coming to the market recently. Can you talk about your comfort with your current footprint, whether you guys have pursued or are pursuing anything out there at this point and whether there are any submarkets outside Santa Monica you guys would target in particular? Owen Thomas : Yeah, no, we want to grow in LA. We're happy with the footprint that we have, but we definitely want to grow it and make LA more in line with our other regions in terms of size and market presence. So but it was as we've been saying, we're going to do it in a disciplined fashion where each deal has to make money for shareholders. We're not going to just grow for growth sake. John Lang and his team in LA are actively looking at most of the deals that are in the marketplace that fit our portfolio and fit our criteria, but to my point earlier about lower interest rates and flows of capital, it's hotly competitive and it's very difficult to find things that we think makes sense. We have expanded our footprint outside of Santa Monica. We are looking at things in Beverly Hills, in Culver City, and El Segundo in other West LA markets of that nature. We continue to hope to be able to, we kind of been describing it as we want to try to do a deal a year and you know it's a very informal goal, but it's a goal and we continue to hope to do that in 2019 and but whether we're able to accomplish that yet right now is a little bit undetermined. Blaine Heck : All right, thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Alexander Goldfarb : So good morning. Good morning out there. Two questions, first, Doug, maybe just in San Francisco. If you could just give your comments on the Mission Rock and Pier 70 projects or potential could be projects on the Portland how that affects your thoughts on 4th in Harrison and if the amount of demand out there in the amount of RFPs is still so much that even with these 2 projects there still sort of a shortage of space for the tenants, you want to take new construction, maybe you can just talk about that. Doug Linde : Sure. I'll make a brief comment and then I'll let Bob Pester give you his view as well. So my view from the cheap seats in Boston is that there is a significant amount of demand from the technology tenants in San Francisco and manifested itself in 2 transactions. And I think we're a little bit surprising where it when Pinterest in salesforce.com both took space in significant blocks on buildings that weren't yet entitled and so there are, there are a number of requirements out in the market today and there are no blocks of space. And Mission Rock and Pier 70 are both good locations there, a little bit further SKU from the central core, but there also phase projects not big projects I sort of on a one-off basis. And I think many of these tenants are looking for larger blocks of space in bigger tickets, at one time. So we feel really comfortable with the relative de minimis amount of new construction that potentially could be put into play and with the sites in Central some of it has been approved. 4th, in Harrison, when it gets approved. And then the sites that the port control. Bob. Owen Thomas : I would just add that there is several million square feet of tenants looking in downtown San Francisco and in the Mission Bay Area. And I would bet that both of those projects will be gone within the next 18 months or so from a leasing standpoint. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then switching costs maybe if Ray is on the line. Just want to get a DC update we just had the budget passage which takes a debt ceiling off for 2 years and sort of both houses of Congress got their spending I guess spending needs fulfilled. So do you think there is a pick up in the demand from government leasing or has the sequester of almost a decade ago, really permanently changed that government demand in such that this 2-year sort of budget reprieve really well manifest in any more demand for leasing in the district? Ray Ritchey : Hey, Alex. But we are seeing is not so much incremental demand in the district. The district is still pretty much of a policy focused type of environment where we're really seeing the increased demand is from both the government space, consumer, but more importantly, the general contractors in that market that as Doug alluded to in our 25 years addressed. And we have never seen the level of both existing tenant expansion and new leasing in the Dallas Corridor and very limited supply the Tysons is a little more restricted in terms of access and in terms of the parking costs and -- County to the west is being totally absorbed with data centers, and as a result those of us, we have great assets in the Dallas Corridor between those two markets are really experiencing a revival in demand from our core tenants which is the corporate user and the defense contractor. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. So basically\u2026 Ray Ritchey : Not too much downtown, but much more in the suburbs. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. So basically, Ray. It's still private and contractor. The government is really not driving the leasing anymore and even wells budget reprieve? Ray Ritchey : Well, we are seeing -- we are seeing some incremental GSA leasing that we just renewed that large tenant, we're seeing continued growth, with new deals downtown, but that's really the private sector, driving the demand in Washington, DC, right now. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you. Operator : We have time for one final question and that question comes from John Guinee with Stifel. John Guinee : Great. Ray, you did such a good job on that one. Let me just ask a couple more our defense contractors taking space anywhere else except the Dallas Corridor and are they still as price-sensitive as they have been and then second, I guess maybe Doug, 3 Hudson Yards, what do you think that new build will cost and did that influence your ability -- willingness to sell 540 Madison from $1100 of square foot? Ray Ritchey : So let me -- let me answer first about the demand in the Dallas Corridor. That's the primary focus because that's number one where the tech employees live and number 2, that's where major defense and cyber commands are located. And we're seeing a move John to a flight to quality, because all these defense contractors and cyber guys have to recruit the best possible talent. And going to a greenfield suburban office park is not going to be it. So the demand for monitise space like in Reston Town Center, again, as I said is probably the strongest I've seen in 25 years. John Guinee : Great. Doug Linde : And John, so I'm not -- I'm not going to give you a specific number on our cost at 3 Hudson Boulevard, suffice to say that it's significantly more than $1100 of square foot, which is what the 540 Madison Avenue building sold for and I don't so, I don't really -- I don't think there's any correlation between the cost of one and this sell the other. I do think that the market demand for 3 Hudson Boulevard, on a relative basis is more than the market demand for what I would refer to as moderately price but well positioned Plaza District properties. So we think that the high-end is where the demand is going to be more fertile for us from a growth perspective. And so as we thought about what the by 540 profile would be from a growth perspective is own alluded to, we decided was muted relative to the other things that we have opportunities to continue to invest our capital in both existing assets and new product and greater Manhattan. John Guinee : Just a follow-up question, five years ago, would you ever thought that statement possible that 3 Hudson Yards would have stronger demand than 540 Madison submarket? Doug Linde : I would say that anything is possible. I would say that we were, we were late to the game, which is something that we've admitted to in the past, we had the opportunity to be in one of the sites that for various reasons we chose not to do and retrospectively, it was the wrong decision. John Guinee : All right, thank you. Operator : And you do have an additional question from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jamie Feldman : Great, thank you. I'll be brief here. So I guess Mike, just can you talk about what your latest guidance it means in terms of AFFO and dividend covered for the year? Mike LaBelle : So, sure, absolutely. So obviously our AFFO improved this quarter and last quarter it was obviously the coverage was less because we had so much absorption of space. Last quarter, it was just a huge quarter. And it showed up in the leasing costs because of the pure kind of square footage of space that we had. Last year our AFFO was $443 a share. That was an increase over 2017. And we still expected to increase this year. We've got the cash same-store growth coming in, we've got incremental cash revenue from our developments. I think that the FAD should be somewhere in the 80% plus or minus kind of range. And if you think about kind of where the pieces are if you look at our leasing costs year-to-date it's $160 million that is probably more than half of what we will experience for the year, we can, because the first quarter was so high. I think that the rest of the year will be a little bit lower and maybe we're somewhere in the $250 to $270 million range for the year on leasing costs. We gave the non-cash rents in our guidance, which is $105 to $120 million and we think recurring capex is somewhere in the $90 to $100 million range. And then if you kind of look at the rest of the adjustments which are stock comp and then other non-cash items you get adjustments of to our AFFO of somewhere in the high 300 so you're talking about an AFFO of somewhere in the $460 to $480 type of range which is again higher than last year, which is $443. Jamie Feldman : Okay, great. Thank you. And then just one follow-up on the markets, I think you had talked about a pickup in large space users in Silicon Valley. Can you just talk more about that. And just kind of what that might look like for you guys over the next couple of years? Mike LaBelle : So look, we've -- we've made a debt on the Silicon Valley from a development perspective. We have the site at Platform 16, we have the site at in --which is another $1.5 million, we have a site in Peterson way, which is 650,000 square feet and we have our site at the station at a station in North first which is somewhere between $1 million and $3 million. And so we're very optimistic about the continued growth of these larger technology companies and when Verizon sells the Yahoo campus and leases and 650,000 square feet and the buyer is Google, which is more growth, I think it's just indicative of what is going on down there. And as I said, we saw the folks from Uber take 300,000 square feet and we are -- we are very aware of other active CBD headquartered companies looking in the valley for big blocks of space and then there are a number of large Valley headquartered companies that are continuing to grow. Apple is continuing to grow. Facebook is continuing to grow. There are a number of others. And so we're just, we're optimistic about the ability for the sites that we have which are relatively speaking very close to public transit and the on station site and the Caltrain has being the attractive places for those tenants to be looking for large cool campus environments. And so -- that we describe, when we talk about what we have coming forward. On the $3.2 billion plus the $400 million. They don't describe that that's going to be put in service at 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue. So where we have a lot of growth in front of us and a significant portion of it is in downtown in San Jose. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And with those deals pencil at today's rents or do you need the movement? Mike LaBelle : Yeah, no, I mean, looked at, we think that there -- that the pro formas that we bought the land at penciled and the rents are higher than the pro forma. So it's -- for us the question is how much pre-leasing do we want, do we want to build some of it on a speculative basis, what's the absorption is going to be? Those are the questions we're asking ourselves. Jamie Feldman : Okay, all right, thank you. Operator : And I want to know -- Owen Thomas : I think -- sorry, Operator, go ahead. Operator : Go ahead. I was turning the call back over to you. Owen Thomas : Okay. I think that concludes our remarks and concludes all the questions. Thank you very much for your attention and interest in Boston Properties, have a good day. Operator : This concludes today's Boston Properties' conference call. Thank you again for attending and have a good day.",

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks. Owen Thomas : Thank you, Sara, and good morning everyone. Q3 marked another strong quarter results for Boston Properties. Macro market trends of job growth, urbanization, and office usage remain favorable. Demand in our major markets continues to be strong and we continue to execute successfully on our revenue and earnings growth strategy. In terms of our key financial highlights for the quarter, we continue to outperform our sector with strong FFO growth in 2019. For the third quarter, our FFO per share was $0.04 above our guidance at the mid-term when adjusting for the refinancing transaction completed in the quarter and was $0.02 above market consensus. We also raised our full year 2019 FFO per share guidance by $0.10 at the midpoint net of the refinancing transaction. We are now projecting 11% FFO growth year-over-year in 2019 even after accounting for the refinancing which is one of our strongest FFO growth years in recent history. Looking ahead to 2020, we are demonstrating the sustainability of our positive growth momentum with initial guidance of 8% FFO per share growth at the midpoint again likely well above the peer average. In terms of operational highlights, we had a busy and productive third quarter. We completed 2 million feet of leasing which is well above our long-term quarterly average for the period bringing our total leasing to 5.9 million square feet year-to-date. We once again recognized for sustainability performance and leadership by earning an 8th consecutive Green Star recognition from the GRESB assessment and ranking among the top 4% of almost 1000 worldwide participants. We acquired 880 and 890 Winter Street two office buildings in suburban Waltham. We entered into a joint venture agreement with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board for 45% interest in our Platform 16 development in San Jose. And we completed 700 million and 10-year unsecured refinancing on attractive terms. Now moving to business conditions, our leasing activity remains healthy and evidenced by the well above average leasing volumes we have been reporting throughout 2019. that being said, most of the reported economic data we followed such as U.S. GDP growth, job creation and unemployment indicate healthy but moderating condition. Economic growth outside the U.S. looks less favorable with China reporting its weakest numbers in three decades and Germany possibly already in recession. While geopolitical issues such as the U.S.-China trade war do not directly impact our business these risks are clearly not constructive for the broader economy. As a result the U.S. Federal Reserve and most central banks in the developed world have an accommodative posture. The significant drop in yield on long-term rates has held in the U.S. this past quarter and long-term rates actually remain negative and many developed economies such as Japan and Germany. In terms of impacts on Boston Properties, we do not anticipate a recession near term. The recession risks continue to rise despite slower economic growth, lower interest rates provide a tailwind for financing costs and real estate valuations. We maintain a hedged capital allocation posture in that we continue to invest in new projects driven by tech and life science demand. But at the same time, we are protecting the downside by keeping leverage low pre-leasing most of our developments and keeping our buildings full with credit worthy tenants and increasingly long-term leases. The private real estate capital market for assets in our core markets remains healthy. Those significant office transaction volume in the U.S. ended the third quarter down 18% from last quarter and down 7% from a year ago. We are still seeing reasonably strong investment demand in most of our markets. The private capital market for office product is becoming more discerning with a preference for tech oriented market locations and minimal lease exposure for assets located in other markets. Yet again, there were numerous significant asset transactions in our markets this past quarter. Starting in Boston, 100 Summer Street in the Financial District sold for $806 million, $722 a foot and a 4.2% cap rate. This 1.1 million square foot office property is 87% leased and sold to a real estate advisory firm. In West LA 5900, Wilshire Boulevard is under agreement to sell for $315 million nearly $700 a square foot and a 4.3% cap rate. This 450,000 square foot office building is 86% leased and will be sold to a real estate advisory firm. In San Francisco, a 50% interest in 525 Market Street in the Financial District is under agreement to sell at a gross valuation of $1.2 billion or nearly $1200 a square foot and a 3.5% cap rate. This 1 million square foot office building is 97% leased and will be sold to a real estate investment manager. And finally, in Washington DC, 625 High Street in the Northwest Quarter sold for $259, $640 a square foot and a 3.5% cap rate. This 405,000 square foot building is 65% leased and sold to a real estate advisory firm. So to summarize, our completed and expected capital activities for 2019, we sold in whole or part five assets for $398 million in gross proceeds versus our goal of $300 million in sales. Several small transactions remained under agreement and could close by year end. We completed three acquisitions so far for $336 million. We launched three new developments comprising a million square feet that are 65% pre-leased with an expected cost of $822 million and projected initial cash yields upon delivery of approximately 7.7%. And we have delivered or expect to deliver into service by year end two projects comprising 675,000 feet costing $508 million at forecast deals. Development continues to be our primary strategy for creating value for shareholders and our pipeline of current and future developments remains robust. This quarter we commenced our 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue development property in Washington DC. This office building located near our 2200 Pennsylvania Avenue asset will comprise 480,000 square feet, 61% pre-leased to Wilmer Hale and has an expected total investment of $356 million. We also commenced our 200 West Street redevelopment in Waltham, Mass. We are converting 126,000 square feet of this suburban office property to life science laboratory space and anticipate investing 48 million into the redevelopment project at double-digit incremental cash yield. With these additions, our current development pipeline stands at 14 office and residential developments and redevelopment comprising 6.3 million aggregate square feet and $3.6 billion of total investment for our share. The commercial component of this portfolio is 78% pre-leased and aggregate projected cash yields are approximately 7%. Most of the development pipeline is well underway and we have 1.6 billion of equity capital remaining to fund. Given selective asset sales, the scheduled delivery of our current development pipeline and forecast NOI growth from our in-service portfolio, we anticipate being able to fund the current development pipeline without either accessing the public equity markets or exceeding our leverage targets. As we pursue and add additional new investment opportunities to the pipeline, we will be increasingly accessing private equity partners to extend the use of our equity capital and enhance our returns. To that end, this quarter we entered into a joint venture agreement with CPPIB to sell a 45% interest in our Platform 16 future development project. This anticipated 1.1 million square foot Class A urban office campus in downtown San Jose is adjacent to Google's planned 8 million square foot transit village and the Diridon station transit hub. With this joint venture we were able to extend the use of our equity capital diversify our risk and enhance our return to shareholders through property level fees and a carried interest arrangement. We are very pleased and honored to enter into this second significant joint venture with CPPIB a leading global institutional investor. Lastly, this quarter, Boston Properties acquired 880 and 890 Winter Street in Waltham for $106 million or $270 a square foot. This two building 392,000 square foot office campus which is currently 82% leased is located adjacent to our 1 million square foot Bay Colony property. With this acquisition, we increased our presence in Waltham to around 4 million square feet further increasing our position as the largest owner and manager of Class A office space in this vibrant market. We plan to invest approximately 20 million of capital to refresh the building and upon lease up and rolling existing rents to market expect to receive in excess of a 7% unleveraged cash return within five years. This is a good example of our acquisition strategy where we use our market presence and knowledge and real estate skills to create value. Before I conclude as a major office market participant, I wanted to provide Boston Properties perspective on WeWork and Co-Working given the intense media attention on the situation. We believe the shared workspace business which provides flexible term turnkey space at a premium price is an innovation that has aggregated user demand has been a positive for the office market and will remain an important procurement option for certain occupier requirements. To put all this in perspective, shared workspace represents only 1.6% of office space in the U.S. and as high as 3.6% in New York and San Francisco. Its share of gross leasing activity and net absorption has been materially higher. Though we believe the shared workspace market has growth potential, we anticipate a pause given recent capital raising challenges in the industry. WeWork has built an important market position in the industry and has the potential for further growth assuming it executes well with the proceeds from its recent recapitalization. Regarding the potential impact Boston Properties, the revenue we received from WeWork from five leases in Boston Properties whole and partially owned assets is about 1% of our total revenue. And all WeWork facilities in our portfolio that have been open for more than a year are substantially full. And lastly, we also have relationships with other shared workspace operators and our own offering called FLEX by BXP. So, to summarize BXPs performance in the third quarter, a year ago we told you, we were at the inflection point of strong and sustainable growth. We've delivered on that commitment and are on track to exceed the growth targets we outlined for 2019 a year ago. We're also delighted with our forecast trajectory for 2020 with estimated FFO per share growth of 8% at the midpoint. Once again we are delivering that growth through a balance of solid same property growth pre-lease development coming into service and smart allocation of capital and expense control. We continue to outperform our sector along most key metrics greatest scale, strongest credit rating, strongest FFO per share growth, greater geographic diversity across both West Coast and East Coast markets, a newer and higher quality portfolio of assets that we've either recently developed or modernized and an unwavering focus on customer satisfaction making BXP the developer and landlord of choice. Let me turn the call over to Doug for more details. Doug Linde : Thanks Owen. Good morning everybody. So, this is the time of the year that we introduced our perspective annual guidance which you all saw in our press release last night. My market commentary this morning is going to focus on the opportunities in our portfolio as they relate to that guidance. Mike's going to provide you with a range for our same-store growth in 2020 and you should think about my remarks as the backdrop for the upper and lower edges of that band. We have completed a significant amount of forward leasing over the past few years which has had the effect of creating an extremely durable revenue stream and provided good clarity on the range of expected outcome going forward especially for 2020. So, I'll start in the Bay Area. San Francisco has a vacancy rate in the low single digits and an availability rate in the mid single digits, 2019 leasing activity has slowed simply to the lack of available space. It's anyone's guess when the first and mission projects, the only speculative building under construction will actually deliver. But it's surely not before 2023. CBRE put out a report a few days ago that indicated that large available blocks over 30,000 square feet even if they're at the base of buildings have asking rents on average over $100 gross. In October, the Prop M received its annual allocation 875,000 square feet bringing the total available availability of Prop M to about 900,000 square feet. We're scheduled to go before the Planning Commission in December to receive our LPA and a Prop M allocation for 505,000 square feet a partial allocation for 4th and Harrison. Our current plan allows for a phased development of the 505,000 square foot building and a 255,000 square foot building. We believe we could start the project as early as the fourth quarter of 2020 and deliver occupied space at the end of 2022. So still a pretty long way out. Our San Francisco CBD portfolio ended the quarter at 96.8% occupied and 98.7% committed. To-date in 2019, we've completed 490,000 square feet of space leasing with an average gross rent increase of about 34%. In 2020, we have 5 full floor expirations in our entire 5.6 million square foot CBD portfolio. We have a lease out on one floor. We are taking one floor for our own office growth and we are dedicating one floor to small enterprise users. This leaves a single build out floor at 535 Mission where the asking rent is over $80 triple net compared to an expiring end of about $60 triple net. And a single floor at easy 3. We have one multi-floor expiration prior to the end of 2021 in the entire portfolio in the CBD. And that tenant has requested our renewal proposal. Last year at this time, we had seven available full floors. In the Silicon Valley, we have a large portfolio of development opportunities. This market continues to experience strong growth led by Google, who recently purchased the former Yahoo campus from Verizon almost 1 million square feet. Verizon in turn has leased 650,000 square feet in close proximity to the Caltrans station in Santa Clara. Uber this quarter has taken another 300,000 square feet in Sunnyvale in close proximity to a Caltrans and we are aware of other San Francisco headquartered companies that are looking in the valley for large blocks of space as well as valley companies that continue to grow. At Platform 16 in San Jose, we are enabling the site and making presentations to tenants that are looking for large blocks of space. It's next to Caltrans. In our existing Mountain View portfolio, we continue to release or renew space that rents in excess of 55 triple net that's single storey product. In 2020, our most significant opportunity in the Bay Area is in this Mountain View portfolio where we will soon have 150,000 square feet of availability. Turning to the East Coast. These are our views on Manhattan now the market conditions have changed. Demand in Manhattan remains robust. Uber announced their deal, Google completed their transaction and at this moment there are technology tenants in active discussions on 300,000 square feet to 1.5 million square feet requirements that represents significant growth. There are a dozen other tenants law firm, banks, media companies, insurance companies and more technology companies with requirements in excess of 300,000 that are seriously considering a relocation to either new construction or renovated project. There will still be significant existing supply from known relocations much of it in older assets that will need substantial capital. So while we are optimistic about the shrinking availability of newly constructed space, we continue to have a cautious view on transaction economics over the next few years. This quarter, we completed a 20-year renewal at 599 Lex with our Anchor law firm starting in 2022 for a minimum of 338,000 square feet. Let's pause here for a minute. We have now extended every major lease expiration in our portfolio above 140,000 feet that was due to expire through 2024. We started that back in 2014. And we relet the City space at 399 Park Avenue and 601 Lex in its entirety. As a note, the transaction costs disclosed in our supplemental are elevated this quarter due to the 340,000 square foot early renewal we completed in 2014 with [indiscernible] at the General Motors building that commenced this quarter. Excluding that lease transaction costs would drop the $43 in total or $5.33 a year. There was no free rent in that transaction but in lieu we provided a higher TI concession. Our portfolio focused in New York remains the four floors 97,000 square foot block at 399 Park Avenue in the General Motors building. We are in lease negotiations today for three of the four floors at 399 Park Avenue and are in discussions with an existing tenant that is interested in expanding into the final floor. We expect this currently vacant space will provide revenue during the fourth quarter of 2020. At the General Motors building since the completion of the plaza work and the opening of the Apple Cube last month, we have commenced lease negotiations for a full floor vacancy at the top, reached agreement to extend two additional four floors that are expiring in 2020 and have activity on a number of the smaller spaces in the building. Activity is meaningfully up though revenue on shelf spaces won't commence until the end of 2020. We still have some work to do with three full floors that will be available during the second quarter of 2020. But we have great progress. I also want to note that at 159 East 53rd Street, we will begin collecting cash rent in two days on the entire 195,000 square feet. However, our incoming tenant has yet to begin their improvement construction which means this will push out our GAAP recognition of revenue into late 2020. Dock 72 opened in September for WeWork and we expect to open the amended space later this quarter. Along with the [Rudin] [ph] organization, we are doing everything we can to market the project to the real estate and tenant community. Two weeks ago, we hosted a two day CRE tech conference and had over 1700 real estate tech participants experience the project. Wegmans opened last week adding another amended to the Navy Yard. We continue to have tenant discussions but there is no imminent lease signing in our sites and hence no expectation for additional revenue contribution in 2020. Moving on to DC, Northern Virginia where almost 10% of the company NOI originates has the largest opportunity for improved occupancy in 2020. The tech tenants that have identified the DC Metro employment base as a fertile area for workforce expansion are continuing to grow and that growth is going to be in Northern Virginia. In addition, the contractors that serviced the defense and Homeland Security businesses are also expanding. Last week, the Pentagon awarded the $10 billion JEDI cloud computing contract a pretty big deal. We expect this initiative will create significant office demand in Northern Virginia. There is still vacancy in Northern Virginia. But the Urban Core of Reston continues to outperform the market with a vacancy rate under 9% and starting rents in the high 40s to low 50s. This quarter we completed a 15-year renewal with the GSA for 492,000 square feet and our Dominion project in 90,000 square feet of renewals in the Reston Urban Core. And two weeks ago, we executed the 75,000 square foot lease with Facebook on three available floors and the Reston Urban Core. We are in active lease negotiations with two large tenants totaling 450,000 square feet. We still will have 500,000 square feet of known availability in 2020, but there are a number of active requirements a few in excess of 100,000 square feet and we expect to make some of these deals, Ray probably expects to make all of them. As we sit here in late 2019, this space is expected to be vacant during portions of 2020. Finally, let's touch on the Boston market where current conditions are as good as we have seen them in our company's history. While similar to San Francisco to the extent there is very little available space in large blocks in the Boston CBD, there are some buildings under construction which will deliver in late 2022 and 2023 with current availability. And there are active plans for new construction which will create supply in 2023 and beyond. Currently, however, there are more than 20 active requirements in the market between 50,000 and 250,000 square feet. Our CBD portfolio is 99% occupied today and we continue to complete forward leasing transactions. During the quarter, we completed almost 200,000 square feet of early renewals and expansions with an average increase in rents of about 30% in the CBD. Much of that expansion is leased to other tenants so we won't realize that revenue until the existing leases expire. In 2020, we have one full floor expiring in the entire Boston CBD portfolio and we have a lease out on that space for delivery upon expiration of the existing lease. We leased an additional 112,000 square feet at our 100 Causeway Street Tower bringing that building under development to 87% leased. In Cambridge, we have no availability but our new development 145 Broadway, 485,000 square feet building leased entirely to Akamai is opening this week on Friday. There continues to be significant demand in the Waltham Lexington submarket which is where we have our greatest availability in the region approximately 5000,000 square feet including 75,000 square feet at the recently acquired 880, 890 assets. Owen described our plans for 200 West Street. So, we have expanded our potential tenant universe in Waltham to now include lab requirements, 195 West Street is an adjacent 63,000 square foot building that became vacant during the third quarter. It may also be converted to life sciences, but we're holding off until we have better leasing visibility at 200 West Street. The 880, 809 buildings were added to the Waltham inventory at the end of August. Our ownership along with the knowledge that we intend to invest in the buildings as we have at Bay Colony has already paid off with signed leases or active negotiations on half of the vacant space at rents in the low to mid 40s. New construction offers rent in this market are in the mid 50s for office and lab rents are pushing $60 triple net. To conclude tenant demand for high quality workspace remains strong and the fight for talent continues to be a primary focus for our customers. We are seeing very strong mark-to-markets in San Francisco and the Boston CBD assets and have opportunities for incremental occupancy related revenue pickup in our Mountain View and Waltham suburban submarkets. Our activity at 399 Park Avenue should deliver some late 2020 revenue improvements and we are having good success with our high-end product at the General Motors building. Finally in Reston, we have good lease negotiations on some near-term expirations and we still need to bring in some new requirements to absorb the 2020 vacancy, but Jake Stroman and Ray Ritchie in the team in Washington is going to deliver that. Michael now translate this operating activity into our 2020 earnings guidance. Mike LaBelle : Great. Thanks Doug. Hello everybody. So last night we released our 2019 and 2020 FFO guidance. We expect 2019 FFO growth of 11% and our initial guidance for 2020 FFO growth is 8% at the midpoint of our range. Our growth is being driven by a combination of strong fundamental operating performance in our portfolio and delivering accretive new developments. Before I jump into the details, I want to touch on our recent financing activities because we were quite busy this quarter. First, we closed a $400 million construction loan to fund the remaining costs to complete our 100 Causeway Office Tower at the Hub on Causeway development in Boston. The financing is attractively priced at LIBOR plus a 150 basis points pointing to the strength of the project that is now 87% pre-leased and will start to be delivered in the second quarter of 2021. Second we issued $700 million of new 10-year unsecured bonds at a 2.9% coupon. We use the proceeds to early redeem a $700 million existing bond that had a 5.6%, which was due to expire in November of 2020. As a result of this, we incurred a charge on debt extinguishment of $28 million which is the redemption premium to prepay the old bonds. The charge totaling $0.16 per share is reflected in our FFO results for the third quarter and our guidance for the full year 2019. Although we don't expect interest rates to increase in the near-term credit spreads are potentially more volatile and are also near all time lows. We view this as an opportunistic trade and it significantly reduced our borrowing costs on $700 million by 270 basis points. The impact on our interest expense going forward is a reduction of approximately $18 million per year or $0.11 per share. Turning to our earnings results, we had a strong third quarter with our revenues up 8% and our FFO up 10% over last year after adjusting for the debt extinguishment charge. We had strong same property performance as well with our share of same property NOI up 7.1% and our share of same property NOI on a cash basis up 5.2% over last year. As we've described on prior calls, our same property NOI growth is moderating in the back half of 2019 as we track against higher comps. We expect our cash same property performance will be flat to slightly negative in the fourth quarter of 2019. This is due to the recently executed 20-year lease extension with a large tenant in New York City that included free rent at the end of 2019. We expect our cash same property performance to turn back to positive in the first quarter of 2020 and for all of 2020. For the third quarter, we reported funds from operations of $1.64 per share that was $0.04 per share or approximately $7 million higher than the midpoint of our updated guidance. The increases from $0.02 per share up higher than projected portfolio NOI and $0.02 per share better than projected management and service fee income. The outperformance in the portfolio came primarily from earlier than projected leasing at higher rents and lower operating expenses that we expect will hit in the fourth quarter. For fee income we earned leasing commissions on the new leasing this quarter at our Hub on Causeway developments and higher service fee income. For the full year 2019, we're updating our FFO guidance range to $6.98 to $7 per share. This equates to an increase of $0.10 per share at the midpoint versus our recent guidance. The increases from growth in our same property in NOI that exceeded our assumptions by 25 basis points adding $0.02 per share; improvement and the contribution of our non-same properties including the acquisition of 880 and 890 Winter Street in Waltham of $0.02 per share; higher fee income of $0.02 per share. We also project lower net interest expense of $0.04 per share primarily from the benefit of our lower borrowing rates. We provided detailed initial guidance for 2020 FFO last night in our supplemental report that's on our Web site. As we look ahead to 2020, we expect to continue our strong FFO growth trend. Our growth will be driven by higher NOI from our same property portfolio for both occupancy gains and higher rents as well as the delivery of new developments. In the in-service portfolio, we anticipate ending this year at an occupancy rate of 92.5%. For 2020, we expect to increase occupancy 100 basis points ending the year around 93.5%. In the Boston market, our urban portfolio in Boston and Cambridge is highly occupied so our focus is on early renewals where we expect a role in place rents up to significantly higher market rents. In the suburban Boston portfolio, we lost 170,000 square feet of occupancy from expiring leases this quarter. As Doug described the activity in Waltham is robust and we anticipate gaining occupancy back in 2020. In New York City, we have approximately 570,000 square feet of vacant space at the GM Building 399 Park Avenue in Times Square Tower, 360,000 square feet of this or more than 60% has signed leases that will commence by mid-2020. We have good leasing activity on the remaining space and expect that a portion will be leased with revenue recognition by the end of 2020. Overall, we expect occupancy to be higher next year in the New York City portfolio. In Los Angeles, we're currently 97% leased with below market rents. We have the opportunity to increase our revenue through completing renewals at higher rents on most of the approximately 750,000 square feet of leases that expire at the end of 2020 through 2021. As Doug detailed, we're also highly occupied in San Francisco though we continue to have the opportunity to gain revenue on our rollover that has a strong positive mark-to-market in both the City and in Mountain View. Next year's earnings will also benefit from the full year of stabilized income at Salesforce Tower that reached 99% occupancy this quarter. Doug also described in detail the rollover exposure that we have in Reston where we will have temporary downtime impacting both our occupancy and our revenues in 2020. In the district, the majority of our rollover exposure is behind us having occurred in 2019 and our 2020 exposure is limited. Our guidance assumes strong growth in same property NOI and cash same property NOI of 3% to 4.75% in 2020 led by revenue growth in Boston and San Francisco. We are assuming non-cash rents to be $100 million to $130 million with the vast majority being free rent that will convert to cash rent. Fair value rent now contribute only $9 million of non-cash rent that's a decrease from approximately $10 million from 2019. So our 2020 same property NOI growth would have been 50 basis points higher, if you exclude the negative impact of the burn-off of this non-cash fair value rent. We will also see growth in 2020 from the delivery of several key development properties and the acquisition this quarter of 880, 890 Winter Street. Our assumption of incremental growth in NOI from development and acquisitions is $60 million to $70 million in 2020. The most significant of these is our 475,000 square foot 145 Broadway development in Cambridge and other key development deliveries contributing to our growth includes 1750 President Street in Reston, 20 City Point in Waltham and the Podium Office and retail phases as well as the 440 unit residential phase of the Hon Causeway in Boston. Our 2019 and early 2020 deliveries totaled 2.3 million square feet and $1.1 billion of new investment. We expect termination income in 2020 to decline by approximately $10 million or $0.06 per share from 2019. This primarily relates to several lease terminations in 2019 instigated by us to accommodate new or relocating clients that we assume will not recur. We also expect our management and services fee income to decline in 2020. We're completing several large fee development projects. These include Dock 72, the first two phases of the Hub on Causeway and the development of the TSA Headquarters project in Springfield, Virginia that we are managing for a third-party. Our assumption for 2020 fee income is $25 million to $32 million and represents a decline of $10 million or $0.06 per share at the midpoint from 2019. Our assumption for net interest expenses in 2020 is $410 million to $430 million. In addition, we expect $9 million of incremental interest expense associated with our unconsolidated joint ventures that is contained in the income from joint ventures line of our income statement. In aggregate, this equates to a modest $3 million increase in interest expense for 2020 at the midpoint. The interest expense savings we've created by reducing our borrowing costs with our recent debt refinancing is offset by incremental interest expense from our $850 million June 2019 notes offering, higher expected line of credit usage from funding development costs and the cessation of capitalized interest from delivering developments. So to summarize, we are initiating our 2020 FFO guidance with a range of $7.45 to $7.65 per share. At the midpoint, this represents an increase of $0.56 per share over the midpoint of our 2019 guidance. The increase is comprised of $0.38 per share of NOI growth in our same property portfolio and $0.37 per share from development deliveries and acquisitions. That is partially offset by a $0.12 per share decline in termination and management service fee income, $0.02 per share of higher net interest expense, a $0.03 per share increase in G&A expense and $0.02 per share of lost income from asset sales. So in 2019, we're anticipating a sector leading 11% FFO growth and we're following it up with guidance for 8% FFO growth in 2020 using the midpoint of our range another strong growth year. We continue to demonstrate terrific growth both internally through increased pricing and occupancy in our same property portfolio and externally by delivering substantial new development investments that are primarily pre-leased and generating very attractive investment returns. And looking further ahead, we have another $2.4 billion of development scheduled to come online between late 2020 and 2022. The commercial space in these projects is 83% pre-leased to a roster of high quality companies. They include the new Marriott headquarters in Bethesda, a new building in Cambridge leased to Google, 100 Causeway in Boston leased to Verizon, 159 East 53rd Street in New York City leased to NYU, Reston Gateway leased to Fannie Mae and 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue anchored by Wilmer Hale. These developments and others that we are working to add to the pipeline will contribute meaningfully to our continuing growth over the next several years. That completes our formal remarks. Operator, can you open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Nick Yulico : Thanks. I guess first off, Mike, in terms of the guidance for next year, can you quantify what is the negative impact to same-store NOI growth next year from GM Reston any other kind of known move outs? And then, what are some of the other major move ins that are benefiting next year? Mike LaBelle : So, we talked on our last call about the rest and move outs, which I think was $17 million approximately and GM was about the same. We were recovering a little bit of the GM because we've actually been successful in renewing a couple of tenants. So, as Doug pointed out so eloquently we've had good activity in GM and we've done better there than we expected. Other than that, we're seeing strong activity in Boston, we have a lot of early renewals that we're doing at 200 Clarendon Street and at the Prudential Center; at 100 Fed, we'll get a full year of the renewal that we did with the Bank of America; and Cambridge continues to be an opportunity although there's no vacancy. The little bit of rollover we have is going to have a big roll up and we'll continue to work on some early renewal activity. Embarcadero Center is significant. We've been building that for a couple of years. We had a big four floor tenant expiring in the middle of 2020, all of that lease, all of that space is basically leased. And we'll commence with big roll ups when it comes available to us. And in New York City, we're also growing year-over-year. So, our NOI from that portfolio will grow and the GM building is growing all of the retail we expect to be leased and generating revenue in 2020 and as Doug described we've had some success in the office network. Doug Linde : I just sort of say the following which is that so the low end of our range assumes everything that we've got going that and all the things we've already done in the high-end of our range assumes that we have a little bit more success with some of the opportunities in front of us in the portfolio vacancy that I described. Nick Yulico : Okay. That's helpful thanks. And then, just second question is on Platform 16. Can you give us a feel for when that project may start and how should we think about the cost expected yield. And I'm assuming you're not going to go spec, but there's not that much spec construction in that market right now feel that there's a lot of demand. And we heard from brokers in the market, you're targeting something like $65, $70 dollar net rent. So, I mean how should we just think about the opportunity here and when it's going to begin? Thanks. Owen Thomas : So, it's Owen. Just to talk a little bit about the marketplace, I think you're right, we are ahead of the other projects that are seeking entitlement and finalizing development plans. Google just made some progress on their entitlement for the project that they're building next to the Diridon Station which is a positive. Much of the development that goes on in this area is not pre-leased. We are actively speaking with potential customers now and hope to acquire an anchor tenant for this project. We are incrementally investing in it today. We are clearing the site, preparing drawings, I would anticipate that this project would commence next year and we will leg into it based on the physical requirements of the site and market conditions. The forecast yields for the project based on our expected costs and the expected rents are in excess of 7%. Doug Linde : This is Doug. You should think about this is a phase project right. So, there are three buildings to be built here. This is just under 500,000 square feet. And so, if we were to do something, we do something with one of the buildings not all three of the buildings at the same time. Nick Yulico : All right. Thanks everyone. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citi. Emmanuel Korchman : Hey. Good morning everyone. You talked about bringing in additional private equity sources especially in your JV developments. Can you just share with us your thoughts on developing within the JV is rather than selling stabilized assets especially in one -- in more stabilized rather than growth markets, instead of giving up maybe some of the development upside. Owen Thomas : So, Manny, its Owen. It's a balance, as I mentioned, we are bringing in joint venture partners because of the robust pipeline of opportunities that we have in front of us. We are not intending to issue equity at our current share price. And we certainly don't want to exceed our leverage target. So that's the governor. We look perspectively what our leverage levels are, and the capital needs from our development pipeline, then we make a decision as to whether we want to, or need to bring in a JV partner on a specific deal. I would say also in the case of Platform 16, it's also a REIT mitigation decision as well because it's a site and it's not pre-leased. And there are -- definitely rewards from the investment, but there are also risks and so we are diversifying our risks as well. In terms of asset sales, we continue to sell assets, I described nearly 400 million of sales that we conducted this year that is material. We will keep doing that. But, as I described before selling major assets for us is inefficient way of raising capital for the developments because most of our major assets have a significant embedded gain. And with the sale comes a requirement to make a special dividend, so we can't retain that capital to invest in that development and it brings down our forecast FFO growth. So that's how we think it. Mike or Doug, anything you guys want to add? Emmanuel Korchman : Doug, you had talked about the wildcard show lease that sort of [throws off stats] [ph]. Is there anyway that you guys could or have mapped for us sort of any of those big chunky leases that have happened in the past or starting to roll into numbers now that are either impacting earnings or other stats? Doug Linde : We can certainly try and think of a way to provide -- give some information. I think that, our hesitation is that unappropriate for us to describe the economics of a particular tenant and because they're so lumpy in terms of when they occur giving you explicit information would be -- would I think not be appropriate. I mean, I can tell you that there was a significant roll up in the gross rent with that tenant and we provided them with TI allowance. That was -- that includes the value of free rent in the form of capital, which skewed the capital numbers, but they didn't get any free rent. So those are the kinds of things that are happening in these transactions, which by the way make it a little bit more challenging to describe the \"capital intensity\" of leases across an office portfolio because so much of this stuff is a part of a negotiation. And it is true that we are in capital intensive businesses from a transaction cost perspective. But we -- sometimes we trade free rent and increase revenue in the short-term for additional capital. So I'm not sure we can think about it and come back to you and if you ask specific questions, we're more than happy to try and give you as much clarity as we can. Emmanuel Korchman : Great. And I don't want Mike to feel left out, so I've got one for him too. You talked about the same store declined in 4Q '19. Can you quantify how much of a lift that then provides in 2020, if you were just to isolate that event? Mike LaBelle : Well, I think what I can tell you is that I think the first quarter of 2020 should be a strong quarter of same store growth. And then, in the second and third quarter of 2020, we're going to experience a rollout in Reston. So, the second and third quarter we'll be dampened because of those rollouts and then -- towards the end of the year it should increase again. I think that's the best way to respond to your question. Emmanuel Korchman : Thanks everyone. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Thank you. I just wanted to follow-up Mike on that fourth quarter swing into negative territory. You mentioned that was partially driven by free rent on a major lease in New York. When does that free rent period burn off next year? Mike LaBelle : It will be burned off before next year. December of 2019 was the free rent period. John Kim : Got it. Okay. Doug, a couple of questions on New York, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned strong demand for new build product. How would you characterize the leasing market for older assets like the GM building? And also you mentioned that you're cautious on transaction economics in New York. And I was wondering if that was commentary on cap rates. Doug Linde : So, I'll answer the first two questions and I'll let Owen answer the third question. So, the leasing activity in New York City on buildings that have recapitalized or repositioned themselves is very strong. And there is significant amounts of demand for buildings both on Sixth Avenue or on Park Avenue or in the Plaza District that are not \"new construction\" that have taken the thought and energy of how to recapitalize and reposition those assets. And for us that's both 399 Park Avenue, 601 Lexington Avenue, and the General Motors Building. With specifically with regards to the GM building, I think I was pretty explicit that we've got a lot of activity going on. That's six months ago did not exist. So the activity in that building, which while you may describe it as an older building in terms of when it was built has had a dramatic amount of new capital put into it. And so, and if you go there, it's a pretty spectacular entry experience now after a really tough sell for the last two or three years because of the construction. And we have a full floor lease out on the top of the building and we have two tenants that are going to renew -- two other floors that are renewing in 2020. And we have other good activity in the building. So, we feel on a relative basis a lot better today than we did six months ago. Owen Thomas : And then to answer your question on the capital market for New York, I think it's bifurcated. I think the market has softened up a little bit in New York for specific classes of assets. So, let me explain. So, we just sold 540 Madison in Midtown last quarter and had great execution on that in terms of cap rate. That as I mentioned last quarter was a smaller asset. It was just over $300 million. So I think for what I'd call bite size single assets in New York, I think there's still a very strong market as we demonstrated last quarter. I think the market is also a very robust for buildings that are in tech-oriented areas of New York and for newer buildings. And I think the market has softened up a bit for more commodity like buildings and certainly buildings -- including buildings that have some significant near term rollover. John Kim : And last question, if I may. On South San Francisco, it's a very tight market. There's increased spillover over of tech tenants moving into that submarket. Is there anything that you can do with 601 and 611 gateway to capture some of this demand? Owen Thomas : The answer is yes. We think there are things that we can do. We are thinking real hard about how in fact those buildings might be repositioned, so that they can accommodate some of that non-traditional office based a.k.a. lab use. And, I think we'll have -- we're in the process of thinking about that and we'll have more to discuss in coming quarters. John Kim : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Craig Mailman : Hey guys. Doug, you mentioned that things are getting a lot better at GM and I appreciate your previous commentary. Is there anything you can isolate that was an inflection that all of a sudden there are more showings or you get [indiscernible] renew that you thought maybe at flight risk? Anything specifically? Doug Linde : So, John Power, why don't you try to answer that question because you're closer to it than I am. John Powers : Well, certainly opening the fabulous new Apple stores, the number one, as Doug mentioned, we've been three plus years without a front door, and having our tenants and the showings go around to the Lexington app side or to the Apple store or all kinds of configurations. So, I would say that is one huge difference. And if you haven't been there, you should go because it's pretty spectacular. Secondly, I think some of this is just timing in the market where tenants are now active and looking and we have space that matches up with needs in the marketplace. We had a number of showings before, but there was somewhat of mismatch between the sizes people were looking for and what we had available. Craig Mailman : That's helpful. Then, Owen, going back to your earlier comments on WeWork and the Co-Working space. I know you guys now have the FLEX offering, but I'm just curious, the one thing that seems like we were proved out was that enterprise tenants were willing to pay up for flexibility. So, I'm just curious what you guys see may over the next, one to three years of maybe changing mindset from landlords and how kind of office space could be or should be leased to potentially capture the premium recipe with the pay for flexibility? Owen Thomas : Yes. That' a good question. Look, I think that what we are seeing in the market is that major corporate users continue to want to have their own headquarters and controlled spaces that are unique and it provides them ability to express their brand and compete for talent. And these facilities are going to be secured on a very long-term basis because that's how they want them. And if you look at our development pipeline, we're building a number of these corporate, -- either a corporate headquarters or regional headquarters for these companies. That all being said, the needs of a company for its square footage, the personnel needs of a company often are more volatile than the timeframe required to procure space on a long-term basis. So, we do think that there are many companies out there that large users that if they could procure some of their space on the margin. And again, it's hard to say exactly what that percentage is, is it 5% is it 10%, who knows? But there's clearly a value to those corporate customers to be able to procure some space on the margin, on a flexible basis. And we work the other operators and now ourselves with FLEX by BXP are tapping into that. I think one thing that is being figured out in the marketplace today is how should that space be priced? Because you are leasing it on a short-term basis and how as the owner of the building, should you be rewarded for that? And what should the rental premium be? Obviously, on a short-term basis, you're taking more vacancy risk. And if you own the space, like we do with FLEX, our TI costs are higher. So that's how the market is evolving. And I would just talk to the following, which is for the most part and I've used this word, in previous conversations about this topic this is shock absorber space. Meaning typically companies are trying to do something either internally with their particular \"platform,\" a.k.a. I'll give you an example. We have a tenant that's agreed to take a piece of the space that we're building in Boston for nine months because they're going to do a major renovation of their own place and they need some place to send their people while the space is being renovated because they don't have swing space in the building. So that's -- I consider that shock absorber space or tenants that are growing in a significant way and the building that they may have -- under construction for themselves may not be done yet, but they still need to hire people or they are thinking about a new business opportunity and they're not sure if it's going to be permanent or not. I mean there are lots of those types of situations that we have seen across the portfolio where we see these types of tenants trying to take that kind of space. And then, \"FLEX\" by BXP space is primarily driven towards small enterprise users. So we're building out floors, not hundreds of floors but a floor or two here and there. And we are looking to try and subdivide it into what we think are appropriate segments of space, meaning 3000, 5,000, 7,000, 10,000 square feet and putting it in a particular place in the building in a type of configuration where it can be easily change for the particular needs of a tenant without much in the way of additional costs. And for that we are charging a significant premium. Bryan Koop : This is Bryan Koop. What we're finding evidenced out as Doug said, is that it's a perfect compliment for our existing client base and especially on these larger projects like the Prudential Center of the hub. We're finding that predominantly the FLEX user is our existing customers for their short-term needs. And it continues to be something that they have strong interest in and we're having daily dialogue with our primary customers on. So it's not as much they'll call it the freelance market. Although we do have those customers in FLEX, it's been predominantly our existing enterprise users. Craig Mailman : That's helpful. And one quick one for Mike, do you have anything in guidance related to maybe going forward the 2021 unsecured given kind of the cost account, just got the 700 million? Mike LaBelle : We don't -- so in 2021 mid year, we have, I think its $800 million at 4.5% roughly that is coming due. I mean, we're obviously looking and thinking about it, but there's nothing in guidance for pulling those forward and paying them up early. Craig Mailman : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jamie Feldman : Great. Thank you. I was hoping Ray or team can talk more about the comments on the JEDI project and what you think that might mean for office demand in Northern Virginia. And actually office end data center and maybe if you could talk about land availability and given how that's been gobbled up by the data center sector? Ray Ritchey : Hey Jamie, it's Ray. Obviously, JEDI is a great news for the entire DC region, most specifically toward Virginia. The vast majority of cloud talent is in the Dulles corridor. And with the exposure of both data centers and the headquarters for major cyber focus government agencies invest in Herndon's, all the three letter agencies and 80% of the internet traffic going through Loudon County. Clearly JEDI will be focusing on Northern Virginia. And as the dominant landlord in that corridor, we expect to get a lot of demand and owning the best office product. We expect to be the recipient of a lot of that demand. But, we're not in a position to make any comments on specific deals or requests for space at this point in time. I can just say the general demand from the tech community in the Dulles corridor and specifically Reston town center has never been stronger. And we talk about the vacancy in Reston. It's important to note that the large sector that vacancy is a relocation of Leidos out of one building, doubling in size to the new building in 1750. So, the biggest issue there is not bad news is great news that we're meeting the demand of our existing tenants. But, I guess the JEDI to DC is almost important as the match natural wind tonight. So, we'll be equally hopeful in both. Jamie Feldman : Is there any thought on how long it takes to actually translate into real demand? Ray Ritchey : I think the demand is going to be almost immediate. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then, switching gears to Silicon Valley, I mean, we saw the Stripe announcement, they're moving from CBD San Francisco to South San Francisco. Can you just talk generally about some of the headquarters or not even headquarters, but some of the moves either from the city down the peninsula or to Silicon Valley. And just kind of how people should be thinking about or how you're thinking about the submarkets that are going to matter most and the types of product that are going to matter most, will we see a shift? Doug Linde : So, this is Doug. So, couple of things. First of all, there is no available big block space in San Francisco. So anybody who is looking to grow significantly in the city is going to have a really hard time between now and 2020 something when a new building gets built and you saw Pinterest and Salesforce commit to -- at the time on unentitled sites and one of them is still unentitled. The workforce is also important. And so, to the extent that it becomes more and more challenging to move around the Silicon Valley. Some of the large Silicon Valley headquartered CBD -- headquartered CBD companies are looking at the Silicon Valley as a fertile place for them to put a location so that it can absorb some additional talent that is not necessarily in the city. And so I assume that is why Uber, for example, went down there and there are two or three others that we're aware of they're looking for additional space right now in the Silicon Valley. Being close to public transit is critical. And so the closer you get to the Caltran and more importantly to the bullets stops on the Caltran, the better off you are going to be. With regards to South San Francisco the move from Stripe, there are a number of companies that are in the payments business Square moved to Oakland. Visa has -- I think made it clear that they're not going to grow in the city of San Francisco. There's a gross receipts tax that is not hospitable to companies that are in the payment transaction business. And so my assumption is that those types of companies will be less likely to grow in the city and more likely to grow outside of the city. But again, the fact of the matter is, is that there are so few opportunities in the district -- in the city itself to make a large splash and grow. It's naturally causing tenants to look elsewhere. And they are most importantly looking for places that are in close proximity to public transportation. Jamie Feldman : Okay, thanks. And then last, are there any developments starts or funding development starts included in the '20 guidance? Mike LaBelle : Nothing new, I mean, again, we're continuing to do some work to prepare Platform 16 to start, but we're not including the cost of starting that development nor is 4th and Harrison assumed in there. And anything that we start those costs obviously will be capitalized. So, the interest cost associated with funding those costs, which would come off of our line of credit or otherwise would be capitalized. Jamie Feldman : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Good morning. I guess I wonder, Doug, could you maybe just talk about the sort of divergence we're seeing kind of in financial services, the announcements of JPMorgan recently potentially moving kind of jobs out versus kind of big tech coming into the city and how you sort of think that dynamic kind of plays out over the next couple of years and its impact on overall net absorption. Doug Linde : So, I'll make a general comment and I'll let Owen describe what's going on in the city from the phase respective. So in general, Steve there has not been a lot of what you would refer to as job growth in the financial services sector for quite some time. There has been job growth in the financial services technology business. So, the Marcus that the new bank's that Goldman Sachs is operating is being created. Presumably there are a lot of tech jobs because it's an online bank. I mean we've seen JPMorgan and others taking what we would refer to as tech kind of space for their technology oriented businesses. But by and large, there has not been a lot of \"growth\" in the general online or in-person consumer oriented or investment banking oriented personnel associated with the financial services businesses. And there has been relatively little in the way of new hedge fund growth. There's been a lot of private equity growth and there's been a lot of alternative asset management growth on -- numerically those are not a lot of bodies. And you've seen tremendous amounts of technology businesses growing in these cities because the labor forces are there. And we've said this all repeatedly further glass four or five years, is that we clearly are in the business of trying to put ourselves in a position to take advantage of the growing customers that are in our marketplaces. And those happen to be technology and in the case of Boston and a place like South San Francisco life science companies. And so it's very natural for us to see a continuation of that. And we're seeing, the same group of kinds of customers that are -- they're growing in San Francisco and now in LA and now in Boston and now in New York, having similar name associated with them, which is, those are the -- I guess the effectively the largest tech titans in the country these days. And they have significant plans for expansion. Owen Thomas : Steve, my own view of it is that we read what you read. We're not experts on JPMorgan strategy with respect to its personnel. However, I would say the following, JPMorgan as well as all the major banks in New York always are outsourcing some of their workforce to other cities around the country. And so, I don't think there's any 'new news' in that. I would just say it's probably the 2019, 2020 version of that trend that's been going on for years. So, I still think that the banks are concluding that New York is the place they need to be headquartered for a variety of talent and client reasons. In terms of the broader picture, what we believe is going on is that many traditional businesses like banking are using technologies and are able to grow their businesses with fewer people. And most of the job growth that we're seeing in the U.S. today is being -- is in the whole technology areas because these companies are creating all of the innovations that are making some of the traditional industries more efficient. And so, if you look at the job growth figures for the United States, this cycle, tech and life science has been very large and a lot of the legacy industries like financial services has been pretty flat. And therefore, if you take that into office demand though, no one prints these figures. I've said before on this call and certainly publicly that I think most of, if not all of net absorption, this cycle in the office business has come from technology, life science and shared workspace operators. Steve Sakwa : Okay. Thanks. And I guess just kind of going back to some of the questions on guidance and maybe for Mike or for Doug, just in terms of what's sort of peeling that onion back on the same store. I'm just trying to get a better sense for, I guess it sounded like Doug, there was a little bit of speculative maybe leasing or things to come at the high end of the range. And I'm just trying to sort of figure out roughly how much or what the wiggle room is, to either get to the low end or the high end. I realized you gave a lot of detail on different markets and different tenants, but how much sort of speculative stuff needs to occur to get to the high end. Doug Linde : So I don't know how you define speculative, Steve, so if it's not signed, I guess it's speculative, right? So we have a high degree of comfort with the rains that we provided. And the low-end of the range is the stuff that we have much more clarity on and the high end of the range has stuff that we don't have quite as much clarity on. And there's a little bit of expectation on -- as Ray and his team in Washington DC moved towards completing the transaction they're working on. But more importantly, getting some of the available space absorbed. And similarly we have other transactions like that as I described in Mountain View and in Waltham, which are clearly more speculative. And I think I did a pretty good job of describing where those square footage is on a relative basis are grounded. And you can put a rent number to those square footages and come up with a percentage of what you think is going to get done in the year and you can sort of get to the top end of our range, which is how we got there ourselves. Mike LaBelle : And Steve, there's always speculative components of our guidance. I mean we always have to make these assumptions every year and every quarter when we give guidance about what might get done, what could get done and how we build that. So, I wouldn't say that the process or the analytics that we've done through this time is any different from what we do. Obviously, the set of opportunities we have is different every quarter and every year. But the process we go through to come up with that is similar. Steve Sakwa : Yes. I wasn't trying to imply that there was something sort of inaccurate or guesswork on the guidance. Just trying to get a sense for how much is already kind of baked in. And then, how much is sort of on the comm., but we can circle back. I guess just lastly, is the rates to kind of 3 Hudson Boulevard and maybe for Ray, just 2100 Pennsylvania, I know 2100 Pennsylvania is well leased, but the prospects for the balance of that space and then just sort of the discussions on 3 Hudson Boulevard. Ray Ritchey : At 2100 Penn, we don't deliver it for another two and a half years and we have more requests for proposals for the space than we have space. And we haven't even taken to the market yet. The demand for first-class brand new space in the best locations in the city is as strong as I've ever seen it, is the kind of device the overall image -- version of the market. But at 2100 Penn, we just wished we had three or four more of them. Owen Thomas : John Powers, why don't I turn it to you for 3 Hudson Boulevard? John Powers : Yes. 3 Hudson Boulevard, we're still underway with their foundations. We had a couple of delays with that, but we expect to have that done sometime probably early in the second quarter. We're about 95% CDs now. We have lobby finishes and whatever, they're not finally selected, but the actual building is pretty much designed. I don't know, a dozen, probably presentations, to uses all over 300,000 feet. Buildings have been very, very well received. We're very, very proud of it, very excited about it, later than some of the developments that's there now. We're probably a year and a half to two years behind other developments. If we went forward, which we have not committed to do. But, we're optimistic enough at this point that we're probably putting a steel order in for the first nine floors to give us a little quicker time to market. When we do go. Owen Thomas : Let me just add a little bit. So, the amount of speculative new construction that was in the New York City sort of vocabulary a year ago is dramatically reduced. So, their first deal was hit at the next building at Brookfield's project. There is strong view that much of 50 Hudson Boulevard is going to be committed. There are additional deals in lease negotiation at the Spire building. So, the opportunity set is much more constricted today than it was a year ago, which I think gives us a lot more comfort that there is going to be somebody who is going to be legitimately serious about taking a slug of space from three Hudson Boulevard. Whether that's in 2020 or 2021, I don't know, in terms of when they make their commitment, but we feel a lot better about the opportunity set in front of us to get the next large requirement that is out there. Now there are some other buildings that we're going to be competing with. We think that we have a unique kind of product that, John has described before. But, we're clearly waiting for that anchor tenant before we make any kind of commitment to move forward. Ray Ritchey : Yes. And I would just add to that, in addition to the supply side, which Doug talked about. John mentioned all the pitches that we've already made. We also see a strong pipeline of perspective new customers that are going to be coming into the market over the next couple of years. So timing is uncertain, but we're certainly confident in the project. Steve Sakwa : Got it. Thanks. That's it for me. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC. Rich Anderson : Hey, thanks. Good morning. If we could just, I know you touched on Docks 72 and everything that's going on there with Wegmans and all that. But, it's been sitting at the, WeWork 33% pre-leased forever. And I'm wondering your level of concern there in terms of attracting new tenancy in the face of WeWork problems. Is there an indirect issue to be concerned about? Is there a direct issue about WeWork sort of backing away to some degree. Would you be willing to bring in FLEX by Boston Properties to supplement some of that? Just any kind of moving part type of commentary would be interesting. Thanks. Doug Linde : So, on a Dock 72 clearly the lease up of this property has been slower than we expected. That being said is an incredibly high quality offering and building. And we haven't fully completed it yet. The buildings open, WeWork is taking occupancy, but all the amenities in the project are not even completed yet. So it's a great show. It had great views. It's got every amenity you can imagine. It's got a fairy at the end of the dock. And I think it's an emerging office location. So Doug talked about the Wegmans opening, the Navy Yard people have done a wonderful job on all of their place making. And we're confident in this project for the longer term. In terms of WeWork they have opened their facility and they started to sell desks and they're off to a good start. And then I talk to them more specifically about WeWork in my comments. Rich Anderson : Yes, okay. Mike, [indiscernible] debt to EBITDA number that's -- I know it's your comfort zone, but it is a turn or two higher than the REIT average. Is that sort of designed to go lower as developments go operational and the denominator goes up or are you comfortable in that six-ish kind of range for the long-term? Mike LaBelle : I think we are comfortable for the long-term with the range we're in right now. I also think that and we've talked about this before, if we were to not do any new investment and we just let everything get built and leased and stabilized our debt to EBITDA would be below six. So we look at prospective, we look at an existing net debt to EBITDA and prospective net debt to EBITDA, when we kind of think about our balance sheet capacity. And we believe that because of the quality of our asset, the length of our cash flows that the company can support a leverage ratio between 6x and 7x. We're very, very comfortable with our credit ratings with our leverage in those ranges. So I would not anticipate us longer term necessarily operating in a different zone. Doug Linde : And Rick, just to be clear about what Owen said before, that the reason we're doing these joint ventures on some of our new developments and some of our new asset acquisitions is explicitly because we're thoughtful and we want to be prudent about what our overall leverage ratio is on a long-term going forward basis. And so we just -- we feel like it's the prudent thing for us to be doing is to be managing those levels. Rich Anderson : Fair enough. And then, last for me, if we're looking at 8% FFO growth next year what would that translate to at the AFFO line? Would it be -- and maybe you could just answer higher or lower than 8%? Mike LaBelle : I mean, I think I can get into it a little bit more than that. We're three quarters of the way through 2019 and so we've got pretty good visibility, where 2019 is as, we look at the fourth quarter and we think about what the leasing costs are going to be and what the capital is. So I would suggest at the end, for 2019 we're going to be somewhere in the 450 to 460 a share range for AFFO. And then, if you think about what we told you about -- in 2019 just to digress, we gained about 130 basis points of occupancy during the year, which is a pretty significant occupancy game. So, the leasing transaction costs that we incurred to both keep the portfolio at its same place, deal with the rollover and increased that occupancy was more significant than it might normally be because of that occupancy game. In 2020 I've told you that our occupancy gain is expected to be 100 basis points, so slightly less. So I would anticipate that the leasing costs in 2020 could be less than 2019, moderately less. As we think about CapEx, our CapEx this year compared to our CapEx next year, I think they will be similar honestly, it's somewhere around a $100 million, maybe $110 million for CapEx. And then, if you think about non-cash rents, I've given you guidance for that. So, year-to-year non-cash rents are basically flat. They're pretty similar. So, if you kind of think about those three things and then you think about our FFO growth, basically all dropped to AFFO. So, our FFO growth at $0.56, I think it was at the midpoint -- is almost a $100 million. And so my anticipation is that, we would get most of that to drop into our AFFO line. And so if you compute that, we could be at $5 maybe a little bit higher than $5 next year on an FFO basis. Rich Anderson : Great. Great color. Thanks very much. Mike LaBelle : No problem. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel. John Guinee : Great. Hey Doug, you mentioned something interesting about TI dollars and free rent dollars. So, if you look at big picture and you say what it costs to move a Class A tenant into a building. You add TI, [FF&E] [ph], architectural engineering fees, technology costs. And I don't know if that's a $200 a foot, $300 a foot, but you can tell us. And then how much of that cost is covered by either the TI allowance or the free rent. And what I'm curious about is whether the tenants coming out of pocket for when it's all said and done, 0% of the costs or 50% of the overall cost to get them relocated. Doug Linde : So John, you ask a complicated question, it will be hard for me to answer it in a queer blurb. So, let me just give you the following thoughts. So, number one is that, every one of these markets is different and the markets that are stronger have a very different tenant improvement allowance and free rent construct in the markets that are less strong. So, as an example, in Boston CBD today for an existing building with vacancy we might only be giving $5 to $7 a square foot of TI for a 10-year term. And we're giving no free rent. And depending upon when the lease expires, we may be giving some amount of build out time for that period of time. So, if it's costing 200 plus dollars a square foot and we're giving 70 bucks and we're simply giving you the time to build out your space, the tenant is paying for a significant portion of that, okay? Juxtaposing that to the weakest market from a transaction cost perspective, which is Washington DC, where in the CBD for a tenant going into a piece of space, they're getting an allowance of $120 to $140 a square foot, and they're also getting free rent of 12 to 15 months on top of their build out time. So, in that marketplace, a significant portion. So if the rent on a new building is call it, $70 on a gross basis and we're giving them a 140, then it's 210 bucks a square foot and they're probably covering a significant portion for a 15-year term in a building in Washington DC, which is just sort of the norm. So, I think it varies significantly, but by and large in San Francisco and in New York City and in Boston, both CBD and suburban free rent is not really part of the equation for those transactions in terms of \"covering the costs,\" in Washington DC it's more of a market phenomenon. John Guinee : Great answer. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. Good morning. Just a quick -- a few quick questions here. One, I think you touched on it earlier, some of your general thoughts on continuing the LA investments, but to the extent that you would look at developments out there, do you think that you would have projects that would be sort of the typical Boston size, call it over 500,000 square feet, or the stuff that you're seeing would be more of a boutique nature, smaller building sizes, you'd look to expand your presence in that market. Owen Thomas : Hey Alex. It's Owen. We'd certainly like to do the larger projects as possible is not easy. We would look at something smaller if we felt like it would lead us into a broader program, whether associated with the property or the groups that we're working with. So, we would consider both. Ray Ritchey : And we've taken a hard run at both larger scale projects and one off boutique type projects as well. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then Ray, while I have you there, your comments on DC or obviously, you guys always do well there on leasing, for new building and certainly at Reston town center, but just thinking about the overall market, it always seems like musical chairs. Are you seeing in DC similar to like New York where TIs and the landlord concessions that they're offering to retain tenants are increasing? Or is it just that as tenants come up, leave Reston town center aside, they just want new construction and therefore no matter what an existing landlord is going to offer those tenants will seek to go to new construction? Ray Ritchey : I think, it's a very bifurcated market. And even our own portfolio, I think it's important to note that, we have six buildings that we own 100% of that is 98% leased and these are newer or recently renovated first-class buildings. And those buildings are doing exceedingly well. We also have in our portfolio three buildings that we own in joint ventures with others that are struggling. So, even with our own portfolio, we have the best in class leases at the highest rents and maintain the highest level of occupancy and the more commodity plays we're struggling. And I think it's clearly a tale of two cities on both the new construction and the existing there is a need and demand for higher tenant improvements. But, we tend to get the rates for them when we give those higher concessions on the base rent. So again, two markets, the commodity space little more challenged. The top tier space is doing exceedingly well. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Mizuho. Tayo Okusanya : Hi. Good morning everyone. I just wanted to talk about kind of the outlook beyond 2020. I mean great details in regards to guidance for 2020, but specifically on the development side, when I look at deliveries in '21, '22, I think the development disclosure is pretty good than a lot of those assets are filled up. But how do we kind of start thinking about potential new developments spend in 2020 that's the result in additional deliveries in kind of like 2022 just kind of given the strong demand you've seen in most of your markets. Doug Linde : So, Tayo, this is Doug. So, Owen described the new assets that I think went into our supplemental disclosure this quarter and we provide dates for those. We have a pretty healthy pipeline of other opportunities that we are looking at across all of our portfolios. And we have a number of \"land positions\" that we hope to translate into development. I think most of that stuff, if we started it in 2020 would have a 2022 to 2023 delivery, but I'll give you some examples. So the 4th and Harrison site, which would be 500,000 square feet in San Francisco, the Platform 16 site in San Jose, which would be somewhere just under 500,000 square feet. The Back Bay station site that we currently -- we're working on permitting in Boston is a almost 700,000 square foot piece of space. The next phase of development in Reston would probably be residential, but there's a 500,000 square foot potential building to build, 3 Hudson Boulevard is a 2 million square foot piece of space. So, that would be a 2024, kind of a delivery. So, there is a lot of stuff and that's in land that we currently control. You would not be surprised to hear me say that there are other things that the organization is working on in all of our submarkets to get additional pieces of development potential that we could get going, either, sooner or later. And they are -- there are millions of square feet of space that are currently being discussed internally in Northern Virginia, in greater Waltham, in the San Francisco submarket, in New York City, that are all important components to even more growth. Clearly, none of it would come online before 2022 or 2023 at the earliest. Tayo Okusanya : Great. Thank you. Owen Thomas : Okay. I think that concludes all the questions and certainly concludes management's remarks. Thank you all for your attention and your interest in Boston Properties. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect and thank you for attending.",

Thank you, Sara, and good morning, everyone. We completed another strong quarter of performance which capped off a very successful year at Boston Properties. Specifically, in the fourth quarter of 2019, we generated FFO per share of $1.87, which is a quarterly record for Boston Properties, and $0.02 above our prior guidance and market consensus. We leased 1.7 million square feet, including significant leases at the GM Building, 399 Park, Reston Town Center, and Colorado Center. We delivered and placed in service 866,000 square feet of new developments that were 98% pre-leased with an initial cash yield of 7.5%. We increased in-service portfolio occupancy to 93%, which is a 40-basis-point increase over the last quarter and 160 basis point increase over where we were a year ago. We increased our average net rental rates on our second generation leases by 48% for the quarter and 28% for all of 2019. We increased our regular quarterly dividend 3% to $0.98 per share. Boston Properties has now increased its quarterly dividend by 42% over the past three years, and we increased our growth outlook for 2020 by raising the midpoint of our FFO per share guidance by $0.01. We continue to forecast 8% growth in 2020 following 11% growth in 2019 leading our office peers over the last two years. In terms of full-year 2019 operational highlights, we completed 7.6 million square feet of in-service asset and development leasing, exceeding 2018 leasing numbers and our second highest level of annual leasing ever. We commenced 908,000 square feet of new developments, including 325 Main Street in Cambridge and 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington. We completed new acquisitions for a total of $336 million, including 880 and 890 Winter Street in Waltham, the remaining 5% interest in our Salesforce Tower development in San Francisco, and land parcels at Carnegie Center in Princeton. We completed approximately $406 million of assets sales versus our goal of $200 million, including the sale of 540 Madison Avenue in New York, Tower Center in East Brunswick, New Jersey; and land parcels in suburban Maryland and Massachusetts. We also formed a joint venture with CPPIB, which now holds a 45% interest in our Platform 16 development site in San Jose. We raised $2.2 billion in debt financing, including $850 million in green bonds at very attractive interest rates. And once again, we are recognized throughout the year for sustainability, performance, and leadership, earning an eighth consecutive Green Star recognition, ranking among the top 4% of almost 1,000 worldwide participants in the GRESB Assessment and earning ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year from the EPA. Overall, 2019 was an excellent year from a management, development, leasing, and capital markets perspective. A differentiator for Boston Properties is the depth and strength of our Regional and Corporate Management teams. I am very proud of our entire team at Boston Properties and what we accomplished in 2019 through experience, relationships, teamwork, and commitment to success. Now, turning to the economic environment. Conditions remain very favorable for our business, and leasing activity is robust in our core markets with few exceptions. Economic growth in the U.S. at around 2.1% projected for 2020 remains high enough to power job creation, space demand, and rent growth, but not high enough to spark inflation and higher interest rates. The 10-year U.S. treasury remains around 1.6%, 1.7%, and the Fed appears to be on indefinite hold for further rate action. Job creation and inexpensive capital is very constructive for what we do. And in addition, concerns over the geopolitical risks of 2019, particularly trade disputes are currently more tempered creating confidence for business leaders to make investments like new space requirements and for investors to move financial markets positively as we have recently witnessed. The private capital market for real estate and office assets in our core markets remain healthy. U.S. real estate assets remain an attractive destination for domestic and foreign institutional capital with stable and growing economy, relatively higher yields, and decreasing hedging costs. Significant office transaction volume in the U.S. ended the fourth quarter up to 24.3% [ph] from the prior quarter and up 3% for all of 2019. Yet again, there were numerous significant asset transactions this past quarter, and I'll cover the largest of which, which were One Marina Park in the Seaport District of Boston sold for a little over $480 million or $918 a square foot and about a 4.6% stabilized cap rate. This little over 0.5 million square foot building is 100% leased and was sold to a domestic real estate investment manager. And secondly, in New York, 330 Madison Avenue in Midtown East is under agreement to sell for $900 million or $1,060 a square foot and a 4.8% cap rate. This 850,000 square foot property is 95% leased and will be sold to a non-U.S. Insurance Company. Now moving to Boston Properties capital activities. Development continues to be our primary strategy for creating value for shareholders, and we remain active in our pursuit of new projects and value-added redevelopment. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we delivered two successful and accretive projects into service. We completed 145 Broadway, the new 485,000 square foot headquarters for Akamai in Cambridge. The building is 98% leased to Akamai and was delivered on time and budget at an attractive yield. We also completed the podium phase of our Hub on Causeway development in Boston. This 381,000 square foot project is 97% leased and was also delivered at an attractive yield. The Hub on Causeway podium is the new entrance to the TD Garden and North Station and includes multilevel retail amenities, restaurants, theaters, and other exciting entertainment venues. Further phases of this development, all of which will be built on top of the podium, include Hub50House, a 440 unit residential tower to be delivered this quarter; 100 Causeway, a 632,000 square foot office tower that is 87% leased and expected to open in 2021; and land under long-term lease to CitizenM, a 269-room, 8-story luxury hotel which was delivered last year. With these deliveries removed, our current development pipeline stands at 12 office and residential developments and redevelopments comprising 5.5 million square feet and 3.1 billion of total investment for our share. The commercial component of this portfolio is currently 76% pre-leased and aggregate projected cash yields on cost are just shy of 7%. Most of the development pipeline is well underway and we have $1.4 billion of equity capital remaining to fund. In 2020, we anticipate our development pipeline will continue to be dynamic. We plan to deliver 6 projects, representing 2 million square feet and $1.1 billion of investment, including 1750 President Street, 159 East 53rd Street, Dock 72, 20 CityPoint, Hub50House and Skyline. We are already recognizing a portion of the income expected from most of these projects. As replacement for these deliveries, we expect to begin the first phases of 4th and Harrison in San Francisco and Platform 16 in San Jose. 4th and Harrison received 505,000 square feet of Prop M allocation in the fourth quarter of 2019 that will allow us to begin construction in 2020. And site enablement work is underway at Platform 16. The first phases of these future developments totaled $935,000, approximately $1 billion in new investment. With our current pipeline of deliveries and these new potential starts, our development pipeline at year-end 2020 could be approximately 8 projects comprising 4.4 million square feet and $3 billion of investment. And for beyond 2020, we have a 13 million square foot land bank under control which should lead to additional development opportunities. Near-term prospects in this portfolio include 3 Hudson Boulevard in New York, 25% owned by us, 171 Dartmouth Street adjacent to the Back Bay Station in Boston and CityPoint in Waltham, for all of which we are pursuing anchor tenants before commencing vertical development. In addition, we have another phase of significant residential development at Reston Town Center. Moving to acquisitions and dispositions. We are under contract subject to due diligence for the sale of New Dominion Technology Park for in excess of $250 million that we believe will close this quarter. The property comprises 493,000 square feet lease to the Federal Government in two buildings located in Northern Virginia. We recently extended the current government tenancy for 15 years at flat rent making the property a strong disposition candidate. We anticipate completing a like-kind exchange for this asset and retaining all proceeds for other investments. We also just completed a joint venture with Alexandria Real Estate Equities for our Gateway Commons portfolio in South San Francisco. This joint venture where both parties will have approximately a 50% ownership when fully funded will be formed with Boston Properties contributing three existing office buildings totaling 768,000 square feet and Alexandria contributing three adjacent buildings including a newly constructed amenity center totaling 313,000 square feet. The critical value creation for Boston Properties and Alexandria with the joint venture is that both parties will contribute land, including a parcel owned by us and encumbered with surface parking by Alexandria, and excess structured parking associated with the existing buildings, creating three sites totaling a minimum of 640,000 square feet of potential development for lab and office use. Upon completion of the development plan, the joint venture will comprise a significant critical mass of 1.7 million square feet of office and life science space in a premier location in one of the strongest life science markets in the U.S. So in summary, 2019 was a very successful year for Boston Properties. We executed well on our growth plan, driven by the lease up of in-service properties and external growth driven by development. Given our leading property market positioning, constructive market conditions, growing new investment pipeline and a team eager to produce, we are very excited for 2020 and beyond. Let me turn it over to Doug. Douglas Linde : Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. Happy New Year. We're not going to say that anymore. It should be pretty clear from Owen's macro commentary that we are feeling really good, very positive about the state of the business economy. And the overall daily transactional leasing activity that we're experiencing across our portfolio really is in lockstep and as you heard during the last 12 months we increased our in-service occupancy by more than 160 basis points, so strong leasing volumes everywhere. You shouldn't interpret this though to mean that every market is strong. We have our strong markets, which are characterized by tight supply and very modest short-term new deliveries, Boston, Cambridge, Waltham, Lexington, San Francisco CBD and West LA, and there we have rental economics that continue to grow and grow significantly, strongly. We operate in the second group of markets, which have higher availability, consistent new construction deliveries, i.e. less supply constraints, but that are coupled with very significant technology demand, so the Silicon Valley, the Reston Town Center area, the new construction on the far West side of Manhattan. These markets are improving. So it's more of a function of the premium of new product being added to the market as opposed to a simple market conditions. The third segment is the Plaza District in Manhattan. It behaves differently since it lacks the technology demand growth. We continue to have strong activity from non-tech users. Obviously they have more modest growth, although we had two deals this quarter, which were expansions from non-tech users. And we'll talk about those in a few minutes. But there does remain significant supply and there really hasn't been much in the way of changes in the economics over the last year or two. And then the fourth category really is limited and in our portfolio to DC CBD, which both has supply and demand headwinds, the best buildings continue to have leasing activity, but the market concessions are at an elevated level. Our primary customer, large real estate users with a private or public startup or established, continue to make decisions to upgrade and consolidate their space and in many cases expand as they use their space in the competition for talent, which is the key to our business. Even in our most expensive markets, we see very few tenants taking actions that reflect looming concerns about their business prospects. A case in point, we're in discussions with a service firm in San Francisco that is currently located in the base of one of our AC buildings. The tenant is negotiating to move to the top of the building where the rent will be 25% higher that's on a renewal in one site versus the other and they will have to come out of pocket over a $100 a square foot to build their new improvements and their square footage isn't changing a bit. Let's talk about the markets now. Our expectations and what's going on in our portfolio. Let me begin with New York City. The significant technology, tenant leasing in Manhattan that was completed over the last few months was very much in line with market rumors and expectations. There really weren't any surprises. It's great since it represents lots of growth and absorption and practically speaking, we think it may accelerate the timing of 3 Hudson Boulevard, since there are fewer new construction options with large space block opportunities. The two law firm leases in the new developments that were announced will lead to availability and existing products. So we are optimistic. While we're optimistic about the shrinking availability of the newly constructed space, we will continue to have a cautious view of transaction economics over the next two years. That being said, leasing volume is very strong. Last quarter, we completed a 20-year lease renewal at 599 Lexington Avenue with Shearman & Sterling, our anchor tenant starting in 2022 for a minimum of 338,000 square feet. We've now extended every major lease expiration in our portfolio above 140,000 square feet. That was due to expire through 2024 and the reason I use a 140,000 square feet is we have a tenant that looks to be moving into one of the new developments in our 601 Lexington Avenue development in 2022. We have signed leases on three of the four available floors at 399 Park Avenue and are negotiating a lease on the remaining floor. As a barometer of market conditions, these leases on these four floors have average starting rent of about a $100 a square foot and market level rent bumps, TIs and free rent. The expiry win on the floors was about $107 a square foot. We would have done a similar deal in 2018 or 2019. In addition, we signed a renewal and expansion as a base for 80,000 square feet and we are negotiating an expansion for one of the tower floors that we're going to get back in 2021, so again, very strong leasing activity. At the General Motors Building, since the completion of the Plaza work in the opening of the Apple cube in September, we've completed 140,000 square feet of office leasing, including a new tenant on a vacant floor full floor and the upper portion of the building, a long-term expansion and to short-term renewal. CBRE reports that the City saw more than 2.1 million square feet of relocation deals with starting rents over $120 a square foot and 1.2 million a relocation deals with starting rents between a $100 and $119. So that's 3.3 million square feet and that versus 2.5 million square feet in 2018. So we are encouraged by the level of activity at the high-end in the market and at our building. We also completed the lease on the available 6,600 square feet of Fifth Avenue retail space for a retailer that is planning to remodel an existing Madison Avenue store. And we did a 7,500 square foot renewal with our for our 2021 expiration on Madison Avenue retail. Switching to Washington D.C., the CBD continues to have, as I said, the most challenging market conditions amongst our reasons that would only represent 6% of our NOI. This quarter, we completed a 76,000 square foot, 10-year renewal at 2200 Pen for lease it was expected to expire in 2021. The current rent, which has been escalating for 2.5% for a decade is going to roll down about 18%. Give you a sense of the conditions in DC. Northern Virginia, we're 9% of our company NOI originates and where we are developing continues to have significant tenant demand growth. The same technology companies that are growing in San Francisco and in Boston and in New York City are also expanding in Northern Virginia as they both service the U.S. Government and search for the highest quality labor markets. We believe that the $10 billion JEDI cloud-computing contract will create significant office demand in Northern Virginia. There is still significant vacancy in the market, but the urban core in Reston continues to outperform with starting rents in the high-40s to low-50s. This quarter, we completed 438,000 square feet of leasing in Reston Town Center including 75,000 square feet for Facebook, a 312,000 square foot renewal with Bechtel and 11 smaller deals. We are in lease renewal and relocation negotiations with another 135,000 square foot tenant. The 270,000 square feet of Leidos relocation and expansion, the 1750 is expected to occur by the end of April. So they're going to vacate one, two freedom square, so we'll still have some work to do, filling our 500,000 square feet of availability in Reston, but we are in active discussions with tenants that could fill significant portions of that space and most recently we entered into a dialogue, aka a lease negotiation with a tenant with a 2023 to 2024 occupancy requirement that is interested in a significant portion of the availability at RTC Next. That's the building that's under construction for Fannie Mae, so really strong activity in Reston. Switching to the West Coast. The story in San Francisco CBD is a lack of availability in 2020 through 2022 and the meaningful increase in asking and taking rents that has occurred. The vacancy rate is at an all time, lowest level since the last cycle began after the great financial crisis. There's about 3.5 million square feet of either under construction or announced and permitted projects with delivery beginning no earlier than late 2022 and more than 1.6 million square feet is either in lease negotiation or leased With our Prop M allocation in hand, we are moving towards the purchase of the land to develop Fourth and Harrison, and we could start construction in late 2020 for an early 2023 delivery tenant conversations have begun. There are additional permitted potential development in 2024 and beyond. New construction rents are approaching over a $100 a square foot, triple net, on all this new development. New to the market or about 700,000 of sublet opportunities stemming from Uber's anticipated move to Mission Bay, so perhaps there'll be a little bit early for tenants. Our San Francisco CBD portfolio ended the quarter at 97.2% occupied and 98% committed. With little availability, we had one of the quietest quarters I can remember with only 24,000 square feet of CBD leasing. In 2020, we have very limited availability, so our focus today is 2021 and 2022 expirations. Based on current market fundamentals, we continue to believe that we will realize double-digit rental increases as we relet space. As an example, we just recaptured a floor at 680 Folsom Street that was leased in 2015. The terminated lease which had 3% annual bumps, had a mark-to-market in 2020, even after five years of escalations of almost 20%, so the market rents continue to grow. In the Silicon Valley, we have our Mountain View assets and a portfolio of great development opportunities. This market continues to experience strong growth led by Google, which leased another 475,000 square feet during the quarter and the market had record setting absorption in 2019. In our existing Mountain View portfolio, we continue to release and renew space at rents in excess of $55 triple net. This quarter we completed two leases totaling 52,000 square feet with an average rental increase of 65%. In 2020, our most significant opportunity in the Bay Area is in the Mountain View portfolio, where we will have about 150,000 square feet of availability. Owen mentioned Platform 16 and our opportunity in San Jose. It's been quite clear that as the technology companies continue to grow, their employees commit to work is becoming a critical factor in their recruitment and retention. We've seen companies like Facebook and Google expand in San Francisco as they provide an alternative location for employees that may spend three plus hours a day on a private bus. And likewise, Uber and Splunk and Twitter and Airbnb have all expanded down into the Silicon Valley for similar reasons. We have seen a distinct premium for those Valley and peninsula office assets that are in close proximity to the Caltrain stops and particularly the bullet locations. Platform 16 and the Plaza at Almaden our other development are less than one mile from the Diridon Caltrain bullet stop as well as future BART connections. I think the last owner-occupied new construction in downtown San Jose was in 2009, 11 years ago and it was based on a set of plans that was drawn in 1987. We believe downtown San Jose, [indiscernible] significant growth and as you read in the Wall Street Journal this morning, it's clearly coming. But last but not least, we're going to get to Boston. The CBD, Cambridge and Waltham-Lexington continue to be the beneficiaries of ongoing growth in the technology and life science sectors and significant immigration from the outer suburban market and corporate relocation. As the Boston region comprises more than one-third of our NOI, we are benefiting from this growth in a big way. Similar to San Francisco, there is very little available space in large blocks in the Boston CBD. There are multiple buildings under construction in Boston, which will deliver in late 2022 and 2023 with some current availability and there are active plans for new construction, including has Owen suggested our permitted project at 171 Dartmouth Street. That's the Back Bay station site, which will create additional supply in 2023 and beyond to meet demand. And an interesting twist, many of the new buildings are being designed for life science users as the availability in Cambridge has all been disappeared. Our CBD portfolio is 99% leased today and we continue to complete forward leasing transactions. During the quarter, we did about 200,000 square feet, including 72,000 square feet at The Hub on Causeway, as Owen talked about. In addition, at 200 Clarendon, we continued to get early renewals and expansions. We completed over 114,000 square feet of leases with an average increase of rents of 30%. In Cambridge, 145 Broadway, 485,000 square foot building leased to Akamai is open. And to put the strength of the Cambridge office market in perspective, if the Akamai lease, which was negotiated in 2016, were to roll to market today, the mark-to-market would be over 50%, four years. There continues to be significant demand in the Waltham-Lexington suburban market, which is where we have our largest availability in the region in 2020. Our 200 West Street project, which is actively being converted to lab use, will be ready for tenant build out in the third quarter. We will continue to expand our potential tenant universe in Waltham to include lab requirements. New construction office rents in this market are in the mid-40s triple net and lab rents are pushing through $60 triple net. Our 180 CityPoint project is permitted and in a position to start with either a lab or an office installation. I'll conclude with a comment about the Prudential Center observatory. Later this year, we expect to commence on major repositioning of the 50 to 52nd floors of the Prudential Tower. We anticipate spending in excess of $125 million, creating an extraordinary experience for local area residents and visitors to Boston, expect an initial return on this capital investment including forgone income from this space, which is part of our 2020 guidance in line with our recent development project, and we hope to open this public facility in mid-2022. With that, Mike has some comments about the fourth quarter results and 2020 FFO. Michael LaBelle : Great. Thank you, Doug. Good morning. As Owen described, we had a really strong year in 2019. In addition to our 11% FFO growth, we demonstrated substantial revenue growth of 9% and the growth came organically from higher occupancy and higher rents in the same-property portfolio as well as externally from the delivery of developments. Our share of 2019 same-property NOI growth ended the year higher by 5.4% over full-year 2018, and it was even higher on a cash basis at 6.7% growth. We also had an incremental $78 million in NOI from our developments, contributing 6.5% to our growth. And we still have an active pipeline of $3.1 billion in developments under construction that are projected to provide incremental earnings growth every year for the next several years. Turning to our fourth quarter 2019 results. We reported funds from operation of $1.87 per share and that was $0.02 per share above the midpoint of our guidance. The increase was primarily from improved portfolio revenues due to a combination of leases commencing earlier than projected as well as better than projected service income from our tenants in the quarter. Our results would have been $0.01 stronger, had we not incurred a $1.5 million charge from extinguishment of debt. We elected to prepay a $26.5 million mortgage, encumbering our New Dominion property. The loan carried a high interest rate of 7.69% and the repayment is reflected in our lower interest expense assumptions for 2020. Looking ahead to 2020, we have updated our FFO guidance with changes primarily coming from our pending asset sale and changes in our interest expense assumptions. Our portfolio NOI assumptions remain in line with last quarter's guidance. Doug detailed the solid leasing activity we're seeing in the majority of our markets, which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver ongoing same-property growth. Our assumptions for 2020 includes same-property NOI growth of between 3% and 4.75%, and incremental growth from our non-same properties primarily our development deliveries of $60 million to $70 million. As Owen described, we have New Dominion under contract per sale and we expect diligence to be completed and the sale to close in the first quarter. The sale results in a significant gain. We plan to complete a lifetime exchange with 880, 890 Winter Street that we acquired in 2019 and the acquisition of the land under our 4th and Harrison development in San Francisco that is currently under option. These exchanges allow us to retain the sale proceeds for reinvestment in higher growth developments. The projected earnings impact of the sale, net of interest earned on the proceeds is $0.04 per share of FFO dilution compared to our prior guidance. The other change in our assumptions relates to reduced interest expense. We now anticipate that we will commence construction this year on the first phases of both our Platform 16 development in San Jose and our 4th and Harrison development in San Francisco. The associated capitalized interest for these developments reduces our interest expense assumptions. Also contributing to the reduced interest expense are the repayment of the New Dominion mortgage and lower interest rates overall. The combination of these items lowers our assumption for net interest expense by approximately $15 million at the midpoint, and our new range is $395 million to $415 million for 2020. So we are increasing our guidance for 2020 funds from operation by $0.01 per share at the midpoint, despite the projected dilution of $0.04 per share from asset sales. Our revised guidance range is $7.47 to $7.65 per share. So excluding the asset sale, we would have increased our guidance by $0.05 per share. All of this points to continuing our strong earnings growth rate with 11% FFO growth in 2019 followed up by projected 8% FFO growth in 2020 at the midpoint. Our 2020 growth will be driven by strong topline revenue growth from increasing rental rates in our existing portfolio and the delivery of profitable developments from our pipeline.  We have a robust $3.1 billion development pipeline under construction with the commercial space currently 76% pre-leased. This plus the expected additions of Platform 16 and 4th and Harrison later this year position us well to deliver continued multi-year growth. That's all we have for our formal remarks. I think the operator will now open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Nicholas Yulico : Okay. Good morning, everyone. I guess, starting out with the new joint venture in South San Francisco, clearly, a very strong market. Can you just give us a feel for how this is going to work in terms of redeveloping existing buildings versus doing new development? And if there's any \u2013 I know you're going through the plans still, but is there any early indications of how we should think about cost per square foot incrementally to build this out along with rents, you think, you can get in the market today? Owen Thomas : Nick, let me start off. I'm sure Doug will have a few comments as well. So just to back up for a second and talk a little bit about our rationale for doing this joint venture. Gateway is a very well located office park near Transit in South San Francisco, which is a very strong lab market and frankly a less strong office market. The keys that drove the joint venture is there is a land parcel that is located between our assets and Alexandria's assets that are part of this joint venture. And that land is owned by us, but it's encumbered by a surface parking easement by one of the Alexandria buildings. So by doing this joint venture, both we and Alexandria are contributing our rights to that site, and we can develop on it. So this JV opens up that parcel to new development, and we and Alexandria also contributed additional sites. And also on the Boston Properties side, we have some excess parking that we can contribute to as well. So the way we look at this is from our standpoint, and I do think Alexandria, this is one plus one equals three. We're creating value just by putting the two sides together. Also from our standpoint, we get to reorient our investment in Gateway, which is primarily an office project to date, to the lab market locally, which is much stronger. We free up 3 new development opportunities. We have no loss of income. So again, I think this is a win-win for both Boston Properties and Alexandria. As it relates to some of your questions about the development, the total development rights as I mentioned and it\u2019s mentioned in the release and in my remarks is over 600,000 feet. It's on three separate sites. We and Alexandria are \u2013 will -- have been and will be working on development plans for those sites. So we're not prepared at this point to answer some of your questions as it relates to cost. There is a possibility that we could launch one of these buildings in this year. So not all of them, but one of them. Douglas Linde : Yes. I would just add a couple of more \u2013 just clarifying comments. So the current portfolio is our three office buildings, an office building that Alexandria owns, a lab building that Alexandria owned, and an amenity building. So think of it this way, right now, we're 100% office, and as of the formation of transaction, we\u2019re \u2013 have about 13% lab, so we've reduced our office exposure. And assuming we build all the lab buildings, and we do some conversion of some of the existing assets, we're probably going to be somewhere closer to 50% or 60% lab in this marketplace at the end of the day. Right now, I think we contemplate that the buildings that will be developed will be lab buildings. They're all sort of in a couple hundred thousand square feet range. And we are actually \u2013 there's a plan that we've agreed to for the first building and we're hopeful that we're going to be in a position to have gotten our permits pulled and start construction on that building by the latter part of 2020. And with regards to market rents, I think our view of market rents is that the lab rents are in the mid-50s plus or minus. And so we try to achieve a 7% return on cost, and I think Alexandria has the same perspective, and so that can sort of give you a sense of where we think new construction will be. Nicholas Yulico : Okay, that's helpful. And then just in terms of the 50-50 nature of the venture, are we to assume that the contributions are roughly equal? So any future spend would be split 50-50? Owen Thomas : The value of what we're contributing is slightly more than the value of what Alexandria is contributing. So the venture is starting off with us owning a little bit more than 50%. And as we proceed with new development, Alexandria will be funding all of it until it's trued up to 50-50. Nicholas Yulico : Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. Just one last question on GM Building. I was just hoping to get an update. I know you've got some leasing done in the quarter. But in terms of the leasing prospects for the remaining vacancy there as well as the upcoming lease expirations and \u2013 as well there was \u2013 there's been some reports about Perella Weinberg, which has a lease for, I think, 130,000 square feet in the building expiring in early 2022. There've been some reports about them being courted for some other redevelopments in the city. How are the renewal prospects looking for that along with the rest of the leasing you're trying to do right now? Thanks. Owen Thomas : John Powers, do you want to take that one. John Powers : Yes. We think Perella will leave. We tried to keep them. We worked on that very hard, but for a number of reasons and restacking in place is always difficult. And I think that they will leave the building. We are talking right now to a couple of tenants for that space. I don't know if we'll make that deal \u2013 those deals, and we have space rolling up. But as Doug said, we had a pretty good quarter at the end of the year, and I'm pretty optimistic. I think we will be moving forward with some amenity space in the building, which will also be a plus. Nicholas Yulico : Thanks everyone. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Craig Mailman : Hey guys. The $12 million increase in NOI loss from dispositions. Is that all Dominion? Or is there \u2013 there's no leakage from the JV contribution? Owen Thomas : No, not at all, it's a 100% New Dominion. Obviously that's not a net number, right. That's just a gross number. Craig Mailman : Right. So what \u2013 depending on what timing you guys have in there, what was the cap rate on New Dominion? Owen Thomas : We're not going to talk about that. It's not a closed deal. Craig Mailman : Okay. And then just you guys have talked about 3 Hudson maybe kicking off sooner than expected. I mean, what kind of interest are you guys getting now that a lot of other new supply is being absorbed? And what timing do you think realistically could be accelerated, too? Owen Thomas : John, do you want to answer that one? John Powers : Thanks, Owen. Yes, we're pretty optimistic based on the tenant response first of all to the building that we\u2019ve received, very positive response. The building, of course, it's on a full acre and it has avenues on three sides. So it's a great site. And we've designed a building that's pretty designed. We're in 100% CDs now. So we've shown it to a lot of brokers, but we've made probably a dozen tenant presentations and it's been very, very well received. So based on that we're still rolling with the foundation, the foundation is not quite complete yet. Obviously, we will not go forward without an anchor tenant. We have a stream of tenants that are interested. Some have \u2013 we can make a 24 lease expiration date. That would be the earliest that we could make. Some of the deals that have been done that have been announced, those tenants met with us. I think everyone of them like the building, but we could not make the earlier dates that they really want it. So we have also some tenants with later dates. We're talking to some 25s, 26s, even 27s. So I think what we've decided now is we have the building that we want to build. We have the foundations. And so this is going to be a win not if and we have to just see how it goes over the next quarter or two quarters to see whether we just continue and go forward or we slow down the construction process. Craig Mailman : Great. And just one last one, I know we had talked previously about land site in Dallas. Is that still kicking around? Where are you guys on that? Owen Thomas : We are not looking at different sites all the time. And so we continue to think about Northern Virginia as a really important focus for our growth. And so we don't have anything that we can comment on specifically, but we continue to look at different assets. Craig Mailman : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi. Michael Bilerman : It\u2019s Michael Billerman here with Manny. Doug, in your opening comments, you talked about the three other pre-development project, 3 Hudson yards, which John just talked about Waltham and Back Bay. I guess if you had to think about the probability of one or more of those projects starting this year, I guess how would you rank them? And how much of it is tenant demand driven versus the rent and the returns that you require in getting those projects off the ground? Right because I assume it's part of both, right? You need the tenants to show up, but then you need them to pay the rents that you want for your shareholders to earn the returns that they thought? Douglas Linde : Yes. So I would answer the question in the following way Michael. So we are actively engaged in conversations with tenants, as John said, at 3 Hudson Boulevard, and we are also actively engaged with tenants on conversations on both 171 Dartmouth Street and on 180 CityPoint. We don't have a signed letter of intent with anyone yet. So I don't think we're in a position where we're close to announcing something. The rents that we are asking are, I would say commensurate with where the market is today and they are more than satisfactory to provide us with an acceptable return to start those buildings. So if you force me to push from a timing perspective, I think that the 171 Dartmouth Street building is probably the one where we have the most significant conversation with tenants who we know are going to want to make a move from where they currently are or expand in the City. And so I said that's probably the one of the three that's most likely. Michael Bilerman : Okay. Bryan Koop : This is Bryan Koop. Some additional color would be as we ended last year with the completion of leasing, let's say for the Hub, which was our major exposure on the urban side. We're thrilled with our position on our development pipeline from the standpoint of our basis as well, because when you look at the recent sales of land at record numbers, we couldn't be more thrilled with our position in this late cycle with both the Back Bay Station and also Waltham with some of the new sites that have been delivered up for sale at exceeding $500 of buildable foot. And then you compound that with them 6% increases in construction costs over the last five years. We couldn't be happy about our position with these development sites that Doug mentioned. Michael Bilerman : Okay. Well, thank you for that Koop. And then the second question, I mean Owen or Doug. Can you take us a little bit behind the curtain on the joint venture with Alexandria, sort of when your discussion started? And also you have a lot of overlap in some of your other core markets. You think about holdings in Cambridge or in San Francisco. Have your conversations expanded to see other ways that you can have a one plus one equal greater than two, between your two organizations that do have very similar philosophies to capital allocation to development, to management and all of those sorts of things? Owen Thomas : Yes. So Michael, its Owen. We initiated these conversations with Alexandria last year and the reason we initiated it was for the rationale that I went through earlier, the one plus one equals three, reorienting our investment in gateway from office to lab. No loss of income, and also I think not only win for us, but also a win for Alexandria. So we initiated it. We just got to close as you know. We have and hope to continue to have a strong relationship with Alexandria, but there's no additional dialogue with them at this time about other joint ventures or other cooperation. Michael Bilerman : Did you discuss at all just selling outright your holdings to them or them selling their holdings to you? Owen Thomas : Our preference was to do the deal that we've currently constructed. We think that's a better outcome for Boston Properties shareholders in selling the Park. Because it's all, as I mentioned earlier, it's all office. It's in a strong lab market. We think will create more value for our shareholders by doing the joint venture as currently constructed than we would if we sold it for cash. Michael Bilerman : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Feldman with Bank of America Securities. James Feldman : Great. Thank you. Just a quick follow-up on the JV. Can you talk about who's going to be managing construction and then managing the assets? Owen Thomas : So the joint venture will be jointly controlled from a governance standpoint. Alexandria will be the property manager, although we will receive a portion of the fees. We and Alexandria will be co-developers, though Alexandria will be in the lead and we will also receive a portion of those fees and we think this structure makes sense, given the larger presence that Alexandria has in the South San Francisco market. James Feldman : Okay. And it sounds like there's an amenity building that's now going to be included in your joint portfolio in the gateway. I mean, what kind of value do you think that adds to your holdings in that submarket? Douglas Linde : So this is Doug, Jamie. We think it holds a lot of value, which is why we did the transaction. So we have three buildings of almost 700,000 square feet that are currently office buildings and are pretty de minimis amount of amenities. And we saw that Alexandria is building, was building 17,000 square foot, high quality first-class amenities building with a significant advantage from a leasing perspective with regards to both office and the lab tenants that are in that marketplace. So we really \u2013 this was truly an opportunity where the two organizations looked at their assets in this particular submarket and said, we're much better off operating. This is one collective as opposed to us sort of doing our own separate things and not being able to untie this piece of land where we owned it and they had an easement on it and where we had extra parking and other assets, and where they had an amenity building. So you throw all this stuff together and it's a win-win for all the customers in both locations today and in the future. James Feldman : All right, thanks. And then Owen I want to go back to some of your comments at the beginning of the call. I guess starting out, maybe just your thoughts on capital flows. You had talked about hedging costs, maybe a potential increase in foreign capital. Just as you look at the office business or office assets that have been kind of slow to trade in the last few years. Do you see a meaningful pickup? And if so, kind of what markets and what types of assets, whether it's core value, add opportunistic, just anything you think may change here. Owen Thomas : Yes. So I just look at the numbers, the transaction volume for our space, those being larger office buildings was a little bit up in 2019 versus 2018. But I think the market is very solid, there's good liquidity. I look at things like interest rates are going down, and cap rates are at least so far have not, so that spread between where the cap rates are and the risk free rate is very healthy, from a liquidity standpoint. I think there is a lot of liquidity in the world is looking for real estate. And I think the U.S. is a very strong destination, given that even though our \u2013 we look at our rates as being low, they're lower in most of the other developed countries and cap rates are even lower. So there's yield available here, there's stability available here, and I'm optimistic for capital flows going into 2020. In terms of the markets, I do think there is a higher level of liquidity for the tech and life science sectors of the private capital market. So I think competitions for buildings that are in Boston or in San Francisco or in West LA are stronger I think in general than they are in New York for example. James Feldman : Okay. We've heard about the pushback on just people getting their heads around CapEx costs. When it comes to office, do you think that that tone has changed at all or that's going to be persistent? Owen Thomas : I don't know if it's changed. That's certainly a focus on the private market as well. But again, every quarter, and I did a couple more this quarter, the cap rates haven't changed much. I mean I've been giving, on these calls, a pretty robust report on the private capital market for Class A office buildings in our core markets, and the cap rates have been sticking more or less in the force. So I think CapEx is always something that's discussed for office and frankly for all types of real estate. But I don't think it's had a material impact on the cap rates. James Feldman : Okay. And then just finally, you would also commented that business conditions and business confidence seem better today than heading into 2019, given some of the global risks at the time you? We saw a lot of tech leasing last year. Do you think this is going to spread to other sectors where you could see, major large expansions from other sectors into some of these markets? Or do you think it will still be mostly tech that's taking down most of the space? Owen Thomas : Yes. I think that tech and life science and other creative industries will continue to be the drivers of net absorption. I think the more traditional industries, financial customers, legal customers, their businesses are fine. They're doing well. I don't see as much growth in those areas. So I think you'll see them, there will be lease expiration driven leasing. And I think many of these employers will also be seeking to upgrade their space, but I'm not sure they're going to necessarily grow substantially. James Feldman : Okay. Thank you. Owen Thomas : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Derek Johnston : Hi, everyone. Doug, do you believe the technology company demands, you mentioned in New York City, actually has some runway and could it potentially continue at this pace or potentially even accelerate? Douglas Linde : So, Derek, I would answer the question in the following way. I believe that that New York City as a physical location for the kind of workers that the technology companies are looking for will continue to be very attractive. It has relatively speaking the best transportation system in all of the major metropolitan markets and it has got affordable and reasonable housing prices within great easy proximity to where companies are locating. And those two things, in my opinion, are very important determinants for where the technology companies are looking to expand their workforce. Plus, they obviously have a lot of college educated workers. So I do believe that New York City has a lot of leg under it, and on a long-term basis, will be a market where the technology companies will continue to grow and prosper. Derek Johnston : Okay. Great guys. That's it for me. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Green with Evercore ISI. Jason Green : Good morning. Split role in California has been a topic that's gained a lot of traction to start the year. Just curious if you're able to share your thoughts on the probability of passage and also the impact it would have on your portfolio? Owen Thomas : So I'll talk about what the impact on the portfolio will be. And I'm going to let Bob Pester talk about the \"probability of passage.\" So the way we look at this is that we have triple net leases and we have gross leases. In a strong market, you can very easily make the argument that well, but triple net lease escalation of taxes will get pushed along to the tenants, and with the gross leases, the escalation to the tenants, that's not rolling, we'll get passed along. But to the extent that you're resetting base years on gross leases. The question will be, how will that impact your net? And if it's a really strong market, you probably could choose to move those gross leases to net leases and sort of continue that \"path\u201d along with your other portfolio. The thing about this split tax is that it's very unclear as how the reassessments will occur? How long it will take? How they're going to do it? How much \"annual escalation\" there will be in the assessments will be every three years that they get to you? Will it be on an annual basis? How many years will take for them to actually start the reassessment process? So all that stuff is very, very much in FLEX. If you said to us, okay, well assuming everything had to get reassessed and assuming you were able to continue to pass along all of your triple net escalation to the tenants, but on your gross leases, you had to demonstrate what the impact was. We would tell you it's probably somewhere between $0.02 and $0.03 a share on our portfolio. And it would take our average lease length is a year or so, it would take eight years for that to roll through. Bob, do you want to talk about the probability of the split role taxing? Robert Pester : Sure. I think the jury is still out on how this is going to turn out, although I believe current polling showing that it doesn't pass. And then there's the issue is this just the first step of them trying to raise property taxes, not just on commercial properties, but then having a second phase that hits residential, which I think is a nonstarter for anyone that owns a house in California, but this will play out over the next six to nine months, and we'll have a better feel during that time. But at present time, I don't think it's going to pass. Jason Green : Got it. And then I guess just a follow-up, just given the votes getting closer, have you seen any change in asset pricing or transaction activity in California just relative to this acts being on the ballot? Robert Pester : I have not. Owen Thomas : And remember that when a new building is sold, it gets assessed to market. So unless there were some odd structure about the way the sale was going to occur, everyone would assume that the assessment would change. And I don't think people are viewing the building escalations after the assessment to have a material impact on the value on a going forward basis. Robert Pester : And that's not a change. So I guess \u2013 it's always been that way. They always get reassessed on purchase, so that's always been kind of baked into the \u2013 in those assets. Jason Green : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey, good morning up there. So two questions from us. So first one, just on the Shearman & Sterling renewal, can you just talk about what played into that? Maybe every partner there commutes in and out of Grand Central. But can you talk about the things that you were able to do to keep them in that building versus some of the other major law firms that chose and other major tenants that chose to go to new construction? So I don't know if they're restocking in place, but maybe, I don't know if there are particular things or if it was just general, they just \u2013 they like where they office, they weren't interested in relocating to a different submarket. Just curious. Douglas Linde : So I'll just make one quick comment and then I'll let John describe the negotiation. We were really good at what we do, Alex. And so tenants like it to be in our buildings. I just make that as sort of a visceral reaction to that. But John, do you want to talk about\u2026? Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you, Doug. I appreciate it. I would expect nothing less from you. Douglas Linde : John? John Powers : Maybe I'll be a little more specific. Yes. I think they were intending to leave. I think they were going to leave. And I have lunch. We've kept in touch with them, but I have lunch with the Chief Operating Officer there and he gave me a list of all the things that were forcing them to leave. And then we took that list one by one and we responded to it and we found swing space for them in the building. We made a deal with Citibank across the street to move \u2013 to get their conference center. So that would be available. It's very hard to rebuild a conference center, pay for that, and then move back into a conference center. So Citibank has downsized as everyone knows here in the corner. And they were ready to do something different with that conference center. So we made a deal with a firm in London to sublease it from Citibank. And then we made a deal with the firm that sublease did to allow Shearman to use it for a year. So they go across the street to rebuild their conference center. So the swing space, the conference center, they had some operational issues in the building because it was a \u2013 these weren't really built based building problems, but they were problems that stem from the way they did. They build a way, way back in the late 1980s, and we were able to get them to understand how that all happened from an MEP standpoint and they were very comfortable that we\u2019re going to fix it all. So given you a high point of a number of things on a much longer list, but when we had all that done, they decided when they looked at their alternatives that they could live here happily for another 20 years, which will by the way make it 50 years at the end of that 20 that they'll be in this asset. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. Thank you. And then second question is, I was talking to a broker recently in one of the life science markets. And the point came up about the political rhetoric that it was on the campaign trail and healthcare and all that fun stuff. And the question is, if it's having any impact on life science leasing. So are you seeing any life science tenants maybe starting to dial back their thoughts on taking space based on what may happen in the election or in healthcare legislation? Or is all that rhetoric not having any impact in life science continues to go full bore? Douglas Linde : So our venue on life science is primarily in the greater Boston market because that's where our life science assets are. And I would tell you that, our view is that interestingly enough, there are more life science tenants looking for space today than there ever have been. And many of those same life science centers are actually, if you will, warehousing space because they're concerned about finding space as they grow. So we have not seen any of the rhetoric translate into a visceral reaction that we should slow down or stop what we're doing because our business models are going to somehow be stressed by what goes on from a political perspective. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you. Douglas Linde : We haven't also seen any slow down in the investment portion of the life sciences. We had a record number of VC investment last year. I think it was one out of every $4 in VC came to the Boston market. We continue to see that. And then we also continue to see several of our clients have a pipeline of, call it, new drugs that are up for approval, which have a tremendous amount of opportunity. So we haven't seen any of the rhetoric translate into demand. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks for taking the question. So just two quick ones. One, can you all sort of rework and maybe just a bit of a slowing down in base here in New York and maybe some other markets. Just give us some updated thoughts on how you see BXP, FLEX evolving? And just maybe broader thoughts or specific thoughts around on plans for the makeready suites that you've referenced in the past? Owen Thomas : Yes. Okay. So maybe I'll make a general comment on the whole shared workspace business. I'll turn it over to Bryan to talk about FLEX by BXP. Clearly there's been a slow down in new leasing from the Coworking operators, given all of the tumult with WeWork last year. And I think that's not only been true of WeWork, but also some of the smaller operators. I mean, I think the markets continue to be healthy \u2013 ending that demand driver has gone away at least for the beginning of 2020. Bryan Koop : Yes. This is Bryan Koop. If you look at our strategy with FLEX in Boston, it's really been almost complimentary to our existing products. So as an example with The Hub on Causeway, we have one full floor that we had always planned on putting into podium and that's 100% pre-leased and opened last week. And we're just thrilled with the product and how it came out. By year-end we hope to have four locations, but it's really complimentary to our existing assets and has nothing to do with what's taking place in the greater market. And then in a greater market on Coworking, I think our FLEX product has been immune from, call it, a lot of the noise because the FLEX product is really for the small-to-medium enterprise, and it's not a Coworking product per se. It's a Space as a Service for small-to-medium enterprises. Owen Thomas : Yes. So we look at it as, we're not trying to grow FLEX for the sake of growth. But if we have \u2013 we do think the product is interesting to a segment of our customer base and if we have the right space in the right place, we'll consider future stores. Douglas Linde : The only other places that we're currently in processes in San Francisco or that we actually got back in November and it's under way to be a floor of a similar ilk in San Francisco. Vikram Malhotra : Great. And then just the JV with Alexandria that\u2019s definitely interesting. Thanks for all the color. This seems like a very specific deal on a specific opportunity, but just curious as you step back and look at sort of your holdings on the East Coast as well, do you think there are opportunities kind of to partner with whether it's private capital or other firms sort of more in a joint venture basis given sort of maybe where we are in the cycle? Owen Thomas : Yes. So to answer you, let me \u2013 I think you asked kind of two questions there. Absolutely this joint venture at Gateway, we're very excited about it. We think it's going to create a lot of value for shareholders versus what we own right now. But it's very specific, it was very specific to the fact that Alexandria owned the assets next door, and had these sites where the development potential was unlocked. So that's why we did it. As it relates to joint ventures overall, we're increasingly using joint ventures in our portfolio for different reasons than the Gateway project. We recently brought in CPP to own a 45% interest in the Platform 16 project. They are our partner on the Santa Monica Business Park acquisition that we, I guess, increasingly less recently made. So we are continuing and will continue to inject private equity into our investment portfolio to extend our capital. The rationale for that is very different from the rationale of the Gateway joint venture. Vikram Malhotra : Great. And then just one last quick one. So The Street retail deals you referenced earlier in \u2013 the two deals I think you recently did. Maybe just give us \u2013 there's obviously been a lot of churn in Fifth Avenue, Madison sort of submarkets, and I'm just curious your thought \u2013 you don't have a \u2013 there's not a massive exposure there, but just your thoughts on where we are in the sort of evolution in terms of rent resets, and do you have a sense of where rents at grade might be there and the two specifics of markets where you have exposure? Owen Thomas : So the answer is, obviously we know what the rents are for the deals that we just did. But we're not going to disclose the specifics of what those tenants are paying. I\u2019d just make two comments and then John Powers, if you want to make some more, you are welcome. The first is that we have now had our second, what I refer to as a successful tenant look at the Fifth Avenue store that we have as a great place to conduct their business while they are doing an ongoing remodel, and they've paid what we would believe are fair market rents for that space, but they have not invested in it on a long-term basis. And then on Madison Avenue, we recognize that the rents are not where they were five years ago and so there's a reset and we're \u2013 that's just the reality. John, do you have any other comments? John Powers : We don't have any retail exposures in that area, obviously the overall rents have dropped in the retail market, but for specific store, for a specific need, there were still people in the market looking at different alternatives. What we've done in some of our other retail is concentrate on food and beverage because that's an amenity to the office towers, which is very important. Vikram Malhotra : Great. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel. John Guinee : Great. Thank you. Wonderful quarter. Wonderful guidance. Life is good. One question, Mike you're bouncing up around us. 6.3, 6.4 net debt to EBITDA and I think you're on a path to deliver about 800 million to 1 billion of development every year, maybe sell 200 million to 400 million of assets. What is your self-imposed maximum on your net debt to EBITDA? And when do you anticipate needing to go to the equity markets, if at all? Michael LaBelle : So we've been pretty consistent over the last many years of targeting net debt to EBITDA between 6.5x and 7.5x. So we've been able to do a lot of development and deliver a lot of properties without raising equity. We have a number of opportunities in front of us, including two, we talked about today. And things that are in the future pipeline and as we determine, if those and when those will come in. We will look at all of the sources of capital that are available to us. So we've mentioned private equity, and bringing that in and we did that with CPP. We can bring in additional debt, which is very attractive and very inexpensive. And we would also consider public equity in the future, to make sure that we maintain our leverage in a place where we think we should be. John Guinee : Great. Then just a couple of a cleanup questions up. I don't think 30 Hudson in your development page on the sup, any reason for that? Or maybe I just missed it. And then second, is everything going smoothly on a Dock 72 and we work taking it on time, taking the space on time. Owen Thomas : I'll respond just to the 3 Hudson. So, right now that's in our land position and the work that we're doing there is improving the land and since we have not made a commitment or decision to move forward with that full development. We are not putting it on our development page until such time as we would do that. And that's very similar to the way that we handle these other projects. And we for example, Platform 16 that we talked about, we're doing enabling work, we're doing prep work, so we're improving the land that we have. But until we decide that we're going forward, we aren't going to put those projects on the development pipeline. John Guinee : Great. Thank you. Owen Thomas : John, do you want to make a comment about on Dock 72? John Powers : Yes. Everything is fine on the WeWork side there. They built out about two-thirds of this space and they're paying rent on all this space. They have a good number of members signed up. We are slow unfortunately on the amenities and we need to get that done. That will be done in the first quarter, and after that's complete, we should \u2013 we expect that more WeWork members were moved in. The amenities of 35,000 feet and they're a key part of what we're creating there. On the leasing side, it's been very slow. As you know, we do have a proposal and we're trading paper on a 50,000-foot full floor, which we're optimistic about, but we'll have to see how it comes out. John Guinee : Great. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Ismail with Green Street Advisors. Daniel Ismail : Thank you, and good morning. For the observation deck at Prudential Tower, is this something you're going to seek to manage internally or look for an operator? And then are there any opportunities to add this and other developments like 3 Hudson? Owen Thomas : So Danny, we haven't made any decisions, firm decisions, yet about how the observation deck on the Prudential Tower will get operated. Interestingly that it exists and therefore doing a major renovation of it obviously made a lot of sense. We thought about having an observation deck when we were developing Salesforce Tower, but we just couldn't make the vertical transportation work in that building given where the design had already been. And I would say that, at the moment, none of our other assets are candidates for those types of uses. Daniel Ismail : All right. Thank you. And then on Proposition E is on the ballots in San Francisco in March. Assuming it passes, does this cause you guys to change your thinking on development timing or acquisitions outside of the city? And are you hearing anything from tenants regarding this ballot initiative? Owen Thomas : So Bob, do you want to explain what the ballot initiative E is so everyone understands it? Robert Pester : Yes. Proposition E is a ballot measure put forth by Todco, John Elberling. And basically, it would tie affordable housing deliveries to the amount of office space that could be delivered in San Francisco, thereby reducing the amount of Prop M allocation if the affordable housing goals aren't met. It's pulling fairly well right now. In our case, the Central SoMa projects all would get their existing allocation that's still outstanding. So in our case, we'd get another 250,000 feet because they want to get the fees from the developers up front. We're not hearing anything from any tenants as far as it's impacting their desire to be in San Francisco or they're looking elsewhere. And San Francisco has always been a difficult market develop in. So I don't think it really changes anything. Daniel Ismail : Do you think this would impact an accelerated phasing of projects in San Francisco or elsewhere? Robert Pester : Only on the Central SoMa projects that have already been approved where it would accelerate the second phase of their Prop M allotment. What the impact will be is existing product, the rent should continue to rise substantially because it's going to restrict supply. Owen Thomas : So Danny, the way this works is that, that the projects that are currently in the pipeline in South and Central SoMa will get their additional allocation. The reason why there would be a theory in acceleration is because if you don't use your Prop M allocation within a certain period of time, Bob, I think it's two years. Robert Pester : Two years. Owen Thomas : It goes back into the bank, and so to the extent that you get the allocation, you'd want to figure out a way to use it. Daniel Ismail : All right. Makes sense. Thanks, everyone. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back over to the speakers for closing remarks. Owen Thomas : Okay. Well, I think that concludes all the questions. That concludes all of management's remarks. Thank you all for your attention and interest in Boston Properties. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's Boston Properties conference call. Thank you again for attending, and have a good day.",

Our speakers will address your questions at the end of the presentation during the question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Sara Buda, VP of Investor Relations, for Boston Properties. Please go ahead. Sara Buda : Hi. Thank you. Welcome everybody to the Boston Properties first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. The press release and supplemental package were distributed last night and furnished on Form 8-K.

These statements involve known and non-known risks and uncertainties and although Boston Properties believes the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions. We can not assurance you that the expectations will be attained. Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements were detailed in yesterday's press release and from time-to-time in the company's filing with the SEC. In particular there are significant risks and uncertainties related to the scope, severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic will mitigate its impact and then direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures on Boston Properties and on our tenants. Boston Properties does not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements. I'd like to welcome Owen Thomas, Chief Executive Officer; Doug Linde, President; and Mike LaBelle, Chief Financial Officer. During the Q&A portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, Senior Executive Vice President and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions. I'd like to turn the call now over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks. Owen Thomas : Thank you, Sara, and good morning everyone. I'm dialed in from Westchester County in New York. I would normally point out at the start of our earnings call, that we once again beat our estimates and explain to you how well we performed in the first quarter as well as our growth expectations for 2020. However, we recognized all our world changed in March, and our focus this morning will be on the state of the COVID-19 pandemic, impact on markets and Boston Properties business, what we're doing in response and how we see the future unfolding. Despite the near-term challenges of the crisis, which I'm about to describe, I'm optimistic about the future and remain confident of Boston Properties ability to both weather current and coming market uncertainty, as well as to pursue over time new opportunity that will undoubtedly present themselves as a result of the crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic took the world, the U.S., the business community and the real estate industry by surprise. It's a good lesson on the difficulty in predicting downturns and the importance of always being prepared for them. The COVID-19 recession is different from past downturns and that it was sparked and is driven by science, not economics, making its future course more difficult to predict. The precipitous drop in economic activity globally has had significant negative impact on many industries such as energy, retail and travel and 26 million U.S. jobs have been lost at least in the short-term. So how does this economic downturn progress from here? The answer is science-based and entirely driven by the fight against the virus. Our economy cannot fully return to normal until individuals feel safe, which can only come with the development of a vaccine, therapies, testing and/or a better understanding of the danger of the virus. With these solutions is likely months down the road, our elected officials at the federal and state levels are faced with very difficult decisions as they analyze imperfect data and balance the need to either extend the lockdown for health safety or reopen the economy risking further outbreaks. So the strategy to shut the economy through remote work has been successful so far in reducing infection rate. The process is slow and economically challenging for many industry. If proper balance is achieved, the economy will likely be opened up slowly over the next few months. But new normalcy cannot be achieved until a medical resolution is discovered and distributed probably in 2021. A downside case would be the economy has opened to swiftly and we have another spike in infection causing further shutdown later in 2020. Its upside case is the more rapid achievement of a medical solution sometime this year. And lastly, the new normal economy will likely be reset below pre-pandemic level given elevated unemployment and restructuring in many factors. These science driven scenarios, which are difficult to predict, create a wide range of macroeconomic outcome and resultant operating environment for Boston Properties in 2020. And lastly on the economy, rapid intervention by the Fed and Treasury with aggressive monetary and fiscal stimulus have been impressive, important and very helpful in mitigating the impact of the crisis as has as the relative health of the U.S. banking system. The Fed quickly reduced the federal fund rate to zero and has provided significant liquidity through a number of measures to ensure functioning markets across the capital market spectrum. Fiscal stimulus, including the Treasury lead CARES Act has brought so far over $2 trillion of needed financial support to small businesses, individual and industries most affected by the crisis. So now moving to the impact on the markets, let me start at the property level lease. As in past recessions and economic slowdown created uncertainty, which reduces some users need for space, business leaders can become more cautious and reluctant to invest capital in new offices. Incremental growth slows putting pressure on market rents, the renewal probabilities for expiring tenants will likely ripe. It is currently very difficult to determine where market rents are today or where they will settle as a result of the crisis as leasing volumes have slowed and very few new leases those price after the onset of the pandemic have been completed. The good news is that the majority of our core markets were healthy entering the pandemic. Further, not all markets will be impacted equally and regions with industries less affected by the crisis such as life science, government and technology should outperform. In terms of private capital markets for real estate, there were a number of sales of Class A office buildings completed in the first quarter in our core markets and pricing consistent with 2019 level. But these transactions are not particularly relevant for thinking about current valuation. As of late March, building sales have essentially stopped offerings have been withdrawn and most buyers for deal agreed before late March have either walked on contract deposit, sort price reductions are delayed closings to seek financing. With the prospect of lower rent expectations of future property cash flows will be reduced and coupled with decreased access to secured financing and nervous buyers, private market values for assets with leasing risks have likely fallen. We are still very early in the correction sellers are probably still in the denial phase and there are limited post-pandemic transaction to provide new pricing guide. Low interest rate and historically wide cap rates spreads were undoubtedly push in the glove. Public office retrading values could provide a marker though the magnitude of the price reduction due to the pandemic being severe relevance to potential reforecast cash flows. Now turning to impact on Boston Properties business, let me start with operations. The most notable change for the majority of us working remotely for the last six and a half weeks, though the arrangement is clearly less efficient and all of us are anxious to return to the camaraderie of our offices. We have been able to effectively operate our business and accomplish important goal. Our buildings have remained fast and open throughout the crisis for customers who need access. I want to thank Boston Properties essential workforce and our heroes of the COVID-19 crisis, our property management organization, for their can do attitude and vigilance under stressful conditions. Our most important activity at this time is planning for the safety and health security of our customers and employees as they return to work in our building likely in the next few months. We have formed an internal cross Regional Health Security task force that is ensuring best practices, which Doug will cover. On the leasing, as of late March new requirements and tour activity largely disappeared. But we continue to close many of the deals we had negotiated before the crisis. There are significant pending leases underway, particularly for our Reston portfolio. The other significant leasing activity has been restructuring short-term cash payment requirements for our customers experiencing financial difficulties largely in our retail portfolio. These deals generally entail deferring several months of 2020 rent into 2021 and later or abating rent in return for lease extension. Non-essential construction activity has been halted by government order in all our markets except Washington DC. Assuming the orders are lifted in the next couple of months, this delay will offset some of the achieved construction schedule cushion on our base building projects out side of the Washington DC region. But we still have sufficient contingency in our project schedule to meet customer delivery day. The greater impact from the construction halt is on tenant work for customers planning to occupy or vacate our portfolio in the coming month. This will cause delays and revenue recognition for several new tenants and hold over rent opportunities for tenants who have delayed leaving. Moving to financial impact, Boston Properties has the scale, market diversity, revenue stability, credit and access to liquidity to navigate the turbulence of the current market storm. First, we have a very high quality portfolio of buildings in the most vibrant cities in the U.S. filled with industry leading tenant. This is demonstrated by the fact that we have collected 95% of April rent due in our office portfolio as of yesterday. And office tenants represent 86% of our total revenue. Further, only 5% of our portfolio roll between now and year-end. The balance of our revenue comes from retail and residential tenant, parking, service fees and a hotel which are more economically sensitive. Doug and Mike will be providing more detailed building blocks for our revenue stream. Our access to liquidity is also very strong at over $2 billion with $661 million of cash on our balance sheet $151 million in a 1031 escrow account, and a billion and a quarter dollar of funding available in our credit facility. In terms of need, we have $1.2 billion remaining to fund on our development pipeline over the next three years and our next unsecured debt maturity of $850 million is not until May of 2021. The unsecured debt market is also available to issue insights at low coupon rates. In terms of Boston Properties investment activity, we raised $254 million from the sale of new Dominion Technology Park in February. We intend to complete a lifetime exchange with this asset for 880 and 890 Winter Street which we purchased last year and the site underlying the 4th and Harrison Development in San Francisco suffering a substantial tax gains. We are also negotiating the sale of a small number of additional assets, which, if completed, would raise over $250 million in net sale proceeds, further disposition activities essentially suspended given market conditions. In terms of new investments, our focus at this time is preserving resources and managing our buildings to ensure health security. We have limited new investments under consideration. So I would expect that will change later in 2020, as the crisis will likely create interesting acquisition opportunities that reset pricing level. We continue to formalize relationships with private equity partners to help capitalize new investments down the road. Our existing development pipeline, which currently stands at 11 projects, 5.2 million square feet, $2.9 billion in total investments and 73% pre-leased will continue to be a strong growth driver for Boston Properties. We just delivered into service last quarter 1750 President, a 276,000 square foot office building located in Reston and 100% leased to Leidos at more than a 7% initial cash yield. Due to the pandemic, we are suspending investment in new vertical development for projects with material [indiscernible]. As you know, we have two significant projects we are planning to launch in 2020, subject to market conditions. The first is our 835,000 square foot 4th and Harrison project in Central Sonoma, where we have completed entitlement and plan for the first phase and expect to purchase the site later this year. We have responded to RFPs from potential anchor tenants, but will not commence vertical development without a significant pre-leased commitment. With second at Platform 16, a 1.1 million square foot three phase office development San Jose, where we have entitlements, plans and own a 55% interest in the site. So we have completed site preparation work in consultation with our partner, we have paused construction activities and we'll revisit our plans once we get through the current phase of the crisis. As a final point, much is being written and speculated about the future use and need for office space as a result of the pandemic. Several business leaders have commented on their success and operating remotely and claimed to be reevaluating their future office space needs. Further urbanization as well as office densification have been questioned, given the imperative of spacing during a viral pandemic. Though no one including myself knows the answers to these longer term questions, it is instructive to focus on what we know today. The biggest impact to the office market near-term is recession, which as I discussed previously will adjust rent and capital value. Low interest rates definitely help. Second, our customers with dense layout including Boston Properties are removing workstation and will return to work in a less dense environment. Some of these users will have a portion of their workforce continue to work remotely and some will require more space. Third, modern healthy and well-managed building with state-of-the-art health security will be at a premium like never before. Lastly, and anecdotally, so this practice has improved our skill at using remote work tools and procedures. It has also made apparent that collaboration, productivity and cultural benefits of working with others in an office environment. So in summary, the widely speculated market correction has arrived, though in a form few predicted. As we've communicated to you over the years predicting downturns is difficult and you must always be prepared. As a result Boston Properties is ready for the COVID-19 recession given our high quality tenancy, long-term leases, modest leverage, access to liquidity and pre-leased development pipeline. Let me turn it over to Doug in Western Mass. Doug Linde : Thanks Owen. Good morning, everybody. I'm in suburban Boston. If you hear noise behind me, it's the Robin that keeps smacking against the window in my study. I want to make a few comments on what we're doing to enhance our health security activities as our buildings begin to refill as well as our current leasing activity, but I'm going to focus my remarks this morning on the context behind our decision to withdraw our guidance for 2020. The health and safety of our employees, tenants, service providers and visitors is first and foremost on our minds. Over a month ago, we formed an Internal Health Safety Task Force comprised of Boston Properties employees from around the company, as well as outside experts in industrial hygiene, cleaning and security. We designed standard operating procedures that will include but are not limited to air filtration, water quality, janitorial products and procedures, social separation during building access and use of vertical transportation, the use of PPE, signage and management of construction activities in our in service building. All of these activities are currently being validated by outside experts. It's possible that some of our procedures may get relaxed over time. As we are being guided by the health and medical experts and acting with an abundance of caution. We will be releasing our plan over the next week to our entire community. Leasing activity for the first quarter was anticipated to be like pre-COVID-19. We ended the year just under 93% occupancy and from a seasonal perspective, the first quarter is typically our quietest period. Recognizing our occupancy levels, leasing in Boston was concentrated on renewal at our Walton asset. In San Francisco, we also had a number of renewals and one modest recapture and release where the rent increased by 50% on a net basis, this was negotiated in late 2019. In New York, we completed our forward lease at 399 Park Avenue on October 2021 expiration, with an 8% increase on a gross basis, again, negotiated in late 2019. In Washington DC, more than 50% of our leases were from GSA renewals. I think a little bit more interesting perspective is really what's going on right now. As Owen cleared, what we know is that the economy is in a recession and many organizations have either laid-off or furloughed their staff. There are no in person tours of space and the implications of social distancing on space planning and utilization are uncertain. In spite of this, during the month of April, we signed another floor lease at 399 Park Avenue with a hedge fund. The office space at 399 is now 100% leased. We also signed a full floor new tenant lease at Time Square Tower with a law firm. We completed the 20,000 square foot extension and expansion with an investment banking firm at Embarcadero Center. We completed 135,000 square foot relocation and 11-year extension in the Reston Town Center with a defense contractor. And we have captured 120,000 square feet of space in suburban Boston with a late 2022 expiration and did a new 12-year lease with a technology company starting in June of 2020. We are actively working to find the leases that are in progress. So the paper is moving back and forth, on 50,000 square feet of leases in New York City, 40,000 square feet in San Francisco, 235,000 square feet in Boston, 200,000 square feet in Los Angeles and almost 900,000 square feet in Northern Virginia, including backfills for significant portions of our Leidos expiration in Reston Town Center and an additional occupant at our Reston mix development. Separately about 300,000 square feet of signed LOIs are currently on what we refer to as COVID-19 pause across our regions. So let's discuss our 2020 revenue. We have a very strong base of revenue, but the economic uncertainty that Owen described, coupled with the variability that has created in certain areas of our revenues is simply too unknown for us to provide tight forecast at this time. And as you know, quarterly and annual guidance is all on the margin. I believe that if we provide you with the data for '19, you will be able to make individual judgments about the COVID-19 impacts on 2020, and more importantly, have visibility on 2021. If you start with our supplemental disclosure, we break out revenues into four categories, lease, parking, hotel, development and management services. I'm going to comment on those first three. In 2019, the lease category made up the majority of our revenues at 93% of the total. And if you break down that a little bit further 92% of that 93% is office and represented retail, and 1% is our apartments. So in bottom-line, office revenues make up 83% of our total revenue base including our unconsolidated asset JVs. So let's focus for a few minutes on that office portfolio. The composition of that office portfolio our share, I'm going to use data from our April 2020 cash billings to give you a perspective of the segmentation again, this is a cast perspective based upon this last month of collections and billings. So financial services make up about 25%, technology and life science companies make up about 24%, the legal profession makes up 22.5%, other professional services which are accounting firms and major consulting firms and other engineering kind of firms make up about 8.5%, manufacturing and retail companies that make things make up about 4.6%, real estate and insurance 4.2%, media and telecommunications or flexible office space providers 2.5%, government 2.5% and education [0.3%] [ph]. So that's a good sense of the where our money is coming from a revenue perspective. 2019 revenues from office leases, including our share of unconsolidated JVs totaled more than $2.657 billion. Office portfolio ended the first quarter 2020 at 92.9% occupied essentially flat to the end of 2019. Owen gave you our baseline April collections for the company. We collected rent in 95% to 100% of all of those office buildings that I just described those categories with the exceptions of our flexible space operators and manufacturing/retail. The manufacturing/retail category includes retail and consumer product tenants with office leases. So those are companies like Aramis and Taylor, Macy's.com, Saucony Clark Jewel and JAKKS Pacific, which is a toy company, those are sort of the larger ones to that category, as well as industries as diverse as the defense sector and electric battery manufacturing. So it's a pretty broad base. Our share of the accrued red balance of those manufacturing/retail tenants that did not take a grant and they're all in the retail oriented businesses stood at $7.6 million at the end of the quarter. In our share of unpaid flexible space operator, accrued rents stood at 4.5 million. 29 days into the quarter, it's not clear those tenants are simply not paying, but we'll catch up, have a short-term liquidity issue for more significant business challenge. We've reviewed our accrued rent balances and our accounts receivable, but the full impact of the COVID-19 shutdown on many businesses is still not yet happening. And while we've increased our reserve this quarter and written up some AR, we have additional reserves we expect will take over the next quarter that we really can't identify today. And those decisions impact our net income and our funds from operations. But bottom line is, we have a really strong set of tenants where we collected the vast majority of our cash rent in 2020 April. I want to repeat that the foundation of Boston Properties ongoing revenues and cash flow is our contractual office lease book with an average lease length of approximately 8 years. One challenge with forecasting short-term revenue of our office leases is knowing the revenue recognition base on many of the newly signed leases. At the moment, we have over 500,000 square feet of sciences with annualized revenues of $37 million on spaces that we have delivered in sell condition and are being constructed by 10th. We are receiving cash rent for some of this phase, but not booking any GAAP revenue. So it's not \"occupied\" yet. As Owen mentioned, construction has been shut down in New York and Boston and San Francisco and we don't have clarity on when local authorities will allow a restart. How long it might be before contractors can fully mobilize on in-service asset and equipment job and most importantly, when those tenants will complete their work and we could commence revenue recognition. So again, on an annualized basis, about $37 million of uncertainty there. Our current baseline office revenue for 2020 assumes virtually no additional leasing other than the volumes I described earlier, the deals we're working on and no contribution from this 500,000 square feet of space that have been delivered in sell condition. Occupancy at year-end is assumed to be modestly lower than our current level. The revenue fixtures including annualized contribution from properties that were brought into service in '19, as well 8 months of contribution from 1750 in Reston, the baseline consolidated office rental revenue contribution including our share and consolidated JVs is approximately $2.683 billion. So 2020 is about 1% higher than 2019 that's sort of our baseline building block for the company's revenues. Okay, so that's the office side. After breaking out financial institutions, telecom and technology tenants with the retail operations, our remaining retail exposure is about $144 million annually and $108 million for the remainder of 2020. This is made up of 275 tenants with more than 40% of the revenue in the fast casual and sit down restaurants sectors. Logically, we have a lot of urban buildings with street level retail and the majority of that is in food services. In April, we collected 23% of rent from its [men's ] [ph] retail group, again, this is after having broken out all the banks and the telecom and the technology companies aka the Apples and the Microsofts, the Verizons and AT&Ts. So with that group of tenants where we collected the 23% of rent, we have an accrued rent current balance of about $30 million for those retail spaces. Now if you add back all the other retail categories, our collections jumps to somewhere between 35% and 40% depending upon the day we collected some more money yesterday. We are working proactively with many of these tenants on lease modifications to ensure their continued operation when we get back to the new normal. We also earned percentage rent in some of the clock leases that we have with high performing tenants. We don't expect to receive any percentage rent in 2020. Okay, so I talked about office revenue, then I talked about retail revenue, next is parking. Total parking revenue in 2019 was $113.5 million. We have two primary components of parking monthly passes and transient or hourly, daily parking revenue. Consolidated transient parking in 2019 totaled $40 million. In April and May with stay at home orders and business closures, we expect our transient income to be non-existent. Some of our monthly parking revenues are contractual agreements, investment leases, and some are at will individual agreements. In the short-term, we have seen some monthly agreements cancelled as well. We don't know if the gradual build up of office occupants will coincide with a slow ramp up in transient parking and monthly parking or potentially a much more rapid increase as our customers choose to drive to work as opposed to take public transportation. Our apartments, our apartment portfolio only contributed 35 million in consolidated revenue in '19. Again 1% of total lease revenue. Virtual leasing is occurring across the portfolio, but not at the pace of in-person leasing that we experienced in early 2020 or '19 and we are in the initial lease up of hub house and had hoped to commence leasing at Skyline in Oakland in May. Construction stoppage of those new developments will impact leasing and delay it and the additional contribution from this portfolio that we had expected in 2020. Finally, we have one fully-owned hotel that contributed $14 million of net operating income in 2019. The hotel closed in early March and it's running at a monthly deficit. It's unclear when it will reopen. And what's the ramp up in business travel, leisure travel and tourism will be in 2020. Mike will discuss our liquidity and capital commitments in a few minutes. But suffice it to say our development capital spend has slowed in New York, Boston and San Francisco. Construction activities have continued as Owen said in Greater Washington DC, albeit with significant health, safety precautions and intermittent work stoppages necessary to clean sites due to COVID-19 impacted workers. So again, I think I've given you the building blocks, where you can pretty quickly come up with your own views on what you think the economic impacts will be of COVID-19 and provide yourselves with estimates for our earnings in 2020 should you choose to do so as well as give you a sense of the baseline for 2021. I'm going to stop here and hand the call over to Mike who is in Medfield, Massachusetts, home of that famous Disney movie, The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes, put in 1969 starring Kurt Russell as a student at Medfield College. Mike take it away. Mike LaBelle : Thanks. Thanks, Doug. I really thought you'd go with the Shaggy Dog. But I'm just happy to see that you're spending your time while at home, catching up on your Disney Classics. Good morning, everybody. First we truly hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy as we experienced this really tough time. This morning I'm going to go through three topics. Our first quarter performance, more details on changes from our prior guidance and our balance sheet and access to liquidity. We had a strong first quarter reporting FFO of $1.83 per share, which is $0.02 greater than the midpoint of our guidance are about $3 million. The office portfolio exceeded our assumptions by approximately $6 million or $0.03 per share. About $0.02 of this was from lower expenses, primarily utility due to the milder winter and lower R&M expense, and a $0.01 per share was from higher rental revenues. This was offset by $3 million of lost income related to the shelter in place orders from COVID-19 which impacted parking income by $2 million and caused us to close our Cambridge Hotel, costing us a $1 million compared to our budget for the quarter. Doug did a great job describing our revenue profile. Our current exposure areas during this crisis are primarily retail parking, and our hotel, which as of the first quarter comprised 11% of our consolidated revenue for the first quarter. To assist you with your model, I want to summarize what we expect the impact on our quarterly run rate will be from these exposure areas so you can get a sense of the change from our guidance last quarter. What is not clear is how long the shutdown of businesses will last. But this information will help you calculate the impact on us based on your own views. Retail is about 7% of revenue. As Doug described there are segments of our retail portfolio with tenants that have justifiable financial needs were actively working on lease amendments. There are a number of alternative structures, but in most cases there will be a pause cash rent followed by a feature increase in rent, term or both. The result will be the loss of near-term cash income. But a more modest impact on GAAP income as we straight line the rent for those tenants we believe will resume operations. We estimate the impact on our quarterly GAAP revenue related to our retail exposure will be $3 million to $5 million per quarter. Parking is typically about 4% of our revenue or $28 million per quarter approximately $17 million of this is a mix of longer term corporate tenant leases and month-to-month leases, where today we've seen only modest impact. The remaining parking revenue is daily transients, which is more heavily impacted and totaled about $10 million per quarter. Our hotel is currently closed, the negative quarterly impact to our FFOs is approximately $7 million versus our prior assumption. With regard to office leasing, Doug also described the impact of the current environment on tour activity that is affecting the pace of new leases for vacant and expiring space. In addition, he described the construction delays are likely to impact our revenue recognition related to tenants who are currently building out space. We expect a reduction of $25 million to $35 million of revenue for the full year 2020. From a slowdown in the pace of new leasing, and TI construction delays combined. This is compared to our prior assumptions for 2020. On the positive side, lower interest rates should result in reduced interest expense on our floating rate debt. The vast majority of our debt is fixed rate, but we have $750 million of floating rate corporate debt, and approximately $200 million in our share, the floating rate joint venture debt where interest is not being capitalized. The drop in one month LIBOR to approximately 50 basis points is expected to reduce our interest expense assumption, but $7 million to $10 million from our prior assumptions for the year. These numbers do not include the risk of reserves we may take associated with the accrued rent for tenants where we may see a dramatic change in their business prospects or actual defaults we may encounter due to the economic impact of the environment our tenants face. Hopefully, the information we provided on tenant collection, leasing and development provides perspective on the current impact of COVID-19 on our business. Overall, I would say we are fortunate. BXP was built to withstand such situations. We've always maintained a conservative balance sheet, a base of strong creditworthy tenant and an appropriate level of pre-leasing to mitigate development risk. Given the uncertainty associated with the timing and pace of returning to work and the unknown depth of the economic recession we believe there are too many variables to provide prudent guidance for 2020 at this time. As a result, we are withdrawing our 2020 guidance and we will revisit this decision in future quarters as we develop more clarity on the economic trajectory of the pandemic. I also want to remind you of the trend in our same property performance. In the first quarter, our same property NOI growth was up 4.8% over 2019, which was slightly better than our expectation. As we described last quarter, we have known move outs in the second quarter, including 250,000 square feet in Reston Town Center, and 85,000 square feet at the GM building. This combined with losses related to COVID-19 is expected to turn our same property NOI growth negative in the second quarter. The last thing I want to cover is the strength of our balance sheet and our liquidity. As a core philosophy, we prepare our balance sheet to fund new investment in good times, but also to be ready from economic disruption so that we are not in a position to be forced to raise capital in a bad market. As evidenced, we raised $2.2 billion of debt capital in 2019 to refinance our 2020 unsecured debt maturities and put cash on our balance sheet to fund our future development investments. We currently have $661 million of cash and $1.25 billion available under our line of credit. We also have $151 million from the sale of our [indiscernible] properties sitting in 1031 escrow account. So in aggregate, our current liquidity exceeds $2 billion. We're also working on the disposition that Owen described it can raise another $250 million. And our external funding needs for the rest of 2020 include approximately $500 million for development that we currently have in our pipeline and $130 million for the land acquisition in 4th and Harrison in San Francisco that we expect to fund with the 1031 escrow account. Our 2020 debt maturities are modest, with only $200 million representing our share of five joint venture mortgages that we expect to have extend or refinance. Our next sizable debt maturity is not until May of 2021. When we have $850 million of unsecured bonds expiring that have a GAAP interest rate of 4.3%. The investment grade unsecured bond market has been one of the most resilient capital markets during this crisis. The market has remained open throughout providing liquidity to corporates. And while 10-year credit spreads for us widened from the low 100s pre-crisis to a wide point about 400 basis points. They have now settled down into the high 200s. Based upon where treasuries are today, we could price the 10-year bond at under 3.5% still near historic lows and lower than the yield on a 10-year bond we issued in mid-2019. We will continue to monitor the market and the potential to layer in additional liquidity in 2020. In conclusion, I want to reiterate that while we are certainly not immune to the economic impacts of COVID-19, office rents comprised 86% of our total revenues and come from an array of mature primarily credit companies with long-term leases in diverse industry groups. April collections from these clients exceeded 95%. And our balance sheet liquidity and access to capital remain a strength of the company providing us with comfort and our ability to ride out a challenging time period and to be ready for opportunistic investment when the clouds clear. Thank you. That completes our formal remarks. Operator, can you open the line for Q&A? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Jamie Feldman : Great. Thank you and we appreciate all the detail and thoughts. I guess just to start out, as you think about, you could see more reserves going forward, you could see tenant bankruptcies going forward, you pulled your guidance. Just how do you think about how long your tenants that kind of are on that list, that watchlist can make it before you really do start to see the wave of or I shouldn't say wave but maybe just to pick up in bankruptcy volumes and greater reserves on your end. Doug Linde : So Jamie, this is Doug. I think that we are not sanguine about what's likely to happen. We do expect there to be some amount of restructuring going on with some of the tenants that I described. But we also think that the office space that they have in our locations may be critical to their ongoing restructuring to the extent that they're able to do that, and so we think we're going to see some of this over the next couple of months or quarters as people understand the severity of the situation. But it's hard for us to tell you one way or another whether particular tenants restructuring is going to involve a major disruption in their use of office space at this point because they are using it although everyone is effectively done the shelter and space -- shelter in place workflows and so they're not currently using that space today, but we expect they'll go back to it. Jamie Feldman : And then what about the retail side? Doug Linde : So our retail side is, I would say in terms of where we collected or we haven't collected. Again, we have an awful lot of service and/or restaurants that are sit down or fast, casual. And we recognize that that's going to be a slow come back. And so we are really trying to work thoughtfully and constructively with those organizations to make sure that we are not the problem that that puts them into a more difficult financial situation. And I think that our locations, from a business perspective are good ones for those businesses where they were doing very well. And I think it's a question of how long it's going to be before people get comfortable going back and being in more crowded areas with regards to eating and getting takeout. And so I think it's going to be a longer road for those companies to figure out whether or not their businesses are going to be \"sustainable\" indoor, they're going to just sort of decided it's not good enough for them to move forward. But, again, we're having very constructive conversations with those operators and where we know that they -- in almost every case they want to come back. Jamie Feldman : Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess, second for me, Owen, you had commented on initially, you think tenants come back with much less dense layouts? Can you just provide more color on the conversations you're having in terms of the amount of space that they do feel like they will need per employee? And just, it seems like the pendulum has gone too far here in density, just what the initial discussions are on that and even from work from home on the longer term. Owen Thomas : Yes. So, Jamie, I think there's speculation in some of that question. And the way I tried to focus my remarks is, acknowledge the questions out there and then focus on what we know today. And I do think there's some short-term and long-term answers. So first, on the densification. Social distancing is going to continue in our core markets even after we go back to work. So employees are going to have to work plus minus six feet apart. So even in our own workspaces, we're looking at that and trying to figure out how we're going to configure space, or how we're going to have our workers come to the office such that that distancing can be accomplished. And, again, I think it will be early days, I think both landlords and customers are figuring this out right now, because the return to work is happening. But we've seen some customers literally just going to going to take out chairs, they're not going to rebuild their space, they're going to take out chairs, or in some cases, they may take more space, or figure out temporary issues. So that's what we know today. Longer term assuming that the virus goes away, we get a vaccine and we're in a real post-pandemic period. My guess is the six foot distancing won't be as important. They'll always be sensitivity to the virus into help. I think everyone's focused on health security will be greater, but I doubt that six foot social distancing requirement will remain. And but I don't think that in general, companies are going to be seeking to densify further from where they were in February of 2020. And frankly, as we've said on these calls before, we thought that trend was sort of sliding anyway. And I think your last question was on the work from home and what impact that's going to have? Again, we don't know there's lots of speculation about it. I think there's no doubt that we all are better at it. We have the tools, we understand its value. But I also don't think there's any doubt that every -- anecdotally, all of whom I speak with want to go back to their office. They miss the efficiency of it, the camaraderie of it. So I don't certainly don't think that the need for office space is going to go away. But I do think that work from home is going to accelerate a trend, maybe you won't travel to that next meeting, if you can do it on Zoom. If someone needs to work from home for a personal reason, or otherwise, one day a week, that's now going to be easier to accomplish. So I think there'll be some trends like that as opposed to wholesale changes in office demand. Jamie Feldman : Okay. But you're not really having those initial discussions yet with tenants in terms of how they're thinking about the world. It's just too early, it's my guess. Owen Thomas : Well, the short-term is one we're having that now. That's why broken into -- we absolutely know of customers that are taking out the Boston Properties and taking out [lease] [ph]. And we also are having, not a tremendous number at this point. But we are having conversations with customers that want more space to deal with distances. So we know that. And Jamie, we've had conversations with some of our technology tenants, and there is no question that the technology tenants are looking to increase the amount of space per employee. And they're clearly thinking about reducing the \"areas of collaboration\" and increasing what you would refer to as personal space. My own personal view is, there is a short-term issue and then there's a much longer term issue. I think the longer term issue is, it is less of a concern because I do believe that there -- once we get through this particular virus, people will get back, could be comfortable, not wearing masks in their offices and being able to be in close proximity to each other. But I think that the -- what this crisis has created is a realization that you have to be prepared for something like this happening in the future. And so I think that will impact densities in a more meaningful way because I think people are going to look and say, okay, I know that we don't have any problems now, but what if we get another one of these kinds of problems? We want to be positioned to be able to recover much more quickly from it. Operator : And your next question is from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks for taking the questions. And again, thanks for all the details \"coordination.\" Maybe just going back to one of the original comments, which talked about certain markets and sectors will probably do better than others. I think tech and government were mentioned. I know why it's hard to comment on kind of rent growth, how they will trend, maybe give us some relative color. Just thoughts on how you view your markets on a relative basis today from a rent growth and a value perspective? Owen Thomas : Yes. I think -- Vikram, it's Owen. That's hard to rank them up based on a future state that depending on a lot of different factors that I outlined in my remark. But I do think as you suggest that I think it is instructive to look at each region and understand what the industry drivers are for demand in those regions. And as I suggested in my remarks, I do think there are industries like life science, like technology, like government that will likely outperform because they either been enhanced or not nearly as heavily impacted by this crisis. In the converse, it's also true. There are industries like energy, like travel, like retail that I think are more heavily impacted. And I think those cities that have higher and lower percentages of those industries, I think that's going to be instructive to think about how the office markets are going to perform over time. Doug, [indiscernible] more you'd like to add? Doug Linde : Yes. I would just add that you do have to look at the current condition of those markets from a supply perspective as well. And so markets like San Francisco and Boston and Cambridge, which are obviously very tight today will have less of that -- there'll be less of an impact relative to the recession than a market like CBD Washington DC from a real estate perspective. On the other hand, people typically look at Washington DC as a better market from a demand perspective during a recession. And it'll be interesting to see whether or not the government reaction to what has been going on will be to invest in infrastructure that will be helpful to the United States and the world going forward. And that would mean office space and job growth. And the question is where might that be if it's in the Washington DC area. But I will tell you that we continue to get inquiries from both technology and life science companies and interestingly in Reston, and in Boston, and in -- to some degrees in the Silicon Valley about additional space requirements, none of them moving quickly. But there are tenants that are thinking about growth. At the same time, there are also tenants that are in the \"New Age economies\" like, in the travel industry or in the food industry that are that were \"Techno\" technology-oriented companies that are obviously going in the other direction based upon their industry sectors. Vikram Malhotra : That's really helpful. And then just maybe building on the inquiries. Can you maybe give us a bit more granular color on the kind of development pipelines, that leads up trajectory from here and given the inquiries, can you maybe give us some color on -- how you were thinking about sort of new starts just prior to this. And what we should be kind of viewing as we think about 2021 and '22 as well. Doug Linde : Let me answer the first question and then Owen, you can take the second, I'll just give the specifics. So in our existing development platforms, the only place where we have \"available space\" today of any significance is at Dock 72, which is in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. And if you've noticed our supplemental, our occupancy was down in Reston because Fannie Mae gave us back a couple of floors. Interestingly, we are in lease negotiations for a tenant who would take that space plus virtually all of the remaining portions of Reston Mex. So aside from that, the only other exposure we have is in our CityPoint property, where we have two floors or 60,000 square feet of space. So our existing development pipeline is basically full or close to committed other than Dock 72. Owen Thomas : Yes. And then, Vikram, just to add to that to think going forward, there are three projects that I would mention. And I would just say, as I mentioned in my remarks as an overlay, understandably, given the crisis, we're much more reluctant to take speculative development risk. And so when you look at our pipeline, on the last quarter call, we mentioned two projects 4th and Harrison and our Platform 16 project in San Jose, that we were considering launching, at least in the case of Platform 16 first phase without tenant. And we put that on pause, because we want to see how this marketplace unfold before advancing either one of those projects further. We are going to buy the site under 4th and Harrison, we have all the plans and the entitlement for the first phase. We own the land under Platform 16, we're ready to go, but we're going to wait for -- in this market environment significant pre-lease. The other project that I'm sure someone's going to ask about is 3 Hudson Boulevard in New York City. And that, I would say hasn't changed that as much because we've been saying on that project, we needed a significant pre-lease to go forward. And that continues to be the case. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Good morning. I guess first as it relates to co-working, I realize it's not a big -- it's not necessarily a big part of the portfolio. But could you just maybe speak to co-working in general and how you guys are sort of thinking about that in the marketplace, the space that could come back into the market, the impact that could have on some of your key gateway markets. Doug Linde : Owen, you want to go first? Owen Thomas : Yes. Sure. I think Steve, sorry, we're in a different location. So I didn't know whether Doug or I going to address this. So look, I think there's no doubt that this environment is challenging for co-working. And because, there was always a debate before the crisis about how well co-working would withstand an economic recession. But what none of us really thought about was how would co-working performed not only in economic recession, but a recession that required social distancing, which is certainly counter to the approach of co-working. So I don't think there's any doubt that it's a going to be a challenged industry during the term of this recession. That being said, I do think long-term there is a role and a place for shared workspace in the real estate market. There are individual small company that like the flexibility and the speed to market of that product. I don't think that's going to go away. And I think there are cuts, there are enterprise customers, larger companies that will continue to want to procure a small percentage of their space on a short-term basis. So I don't think those demand drivers are going to go away. So I think that the industry over the long-term will still be around. But in the short-term, it's challenged and clearly there is limited growth, probably contraction, amongst the co-working operators. And there may be some consolidation in the sector, and it's not going to be a source of net absorption for the office markets for the foreseeable future. Doug Linde : And Steve, relative to supply, I think it's a fair question. There's no question that some of the operators are probably going to reduce the number of locations that they currently have leases to. And as you know, they have the ability to do that relative to \"leaving\" their LLCs out there and continuing to operate their \"overall mothership\". And that space, in many cases is probably not, as it's currently configured very amenable to a new installation. Now, that doesn't mean that it can't be retro fitted, with the reasonable amounts of capital put into it to make it very functional. But the landlords are going to have to make those decisions as to whether or not they want to spend the money to redo those types of spaces because obviously, they were constructed from a different kind of a utility. And so I do think that there will be some of that space in the major markets that will come back and that we will have to deal with that from a supply perspective. The good news is that I think we've talked about in the past. In markets like Boston and San Francisco, the relative amount of that stuff, compared to the total overall market wasn't that great, because the markets were so tight. I think New York City obviously is going to have more of an issue with the number of installations that are there. And then, clearly, some of the other markets where the co-working flexibility as operators have had a larger proportion of the absorption are going to have some impact. Steve Sakwa : Okay. And just maybe as a follow up on that, to the extent that you did get back into co-working space, would it be your, I guess, intention to sort of reconfigure it into sort of, the flex by BXP product, or do you think you'd have to sort of reconvert it to just traditional office space and release it in the market? Doug Linde : I think it'll depend on what it is and where it is and if in fact, we were in a position where we get some of those spaces back. I mean, we're relatively little exposure and the spaces that we do have are relatively small, there's sort of a floor here and a floor there. So we feel like we'll be able to adjust appropriately, I will tell you that today, I'm not entirely sure what the right configuration for a new floor space and we're going have to figure that out as time goes on based upon the way the customers are looking at what they want and what they need. And so we would be probably somewhat reluctant to take one of these spaces back and just and got it and put it into \"selected\" by BXP configuration in the short-term. Steve Sakwa : Okay. And then just one question for Mike, I guess on the -- thanks for laying out some of the retail that you talked about and some of the troubled operators to guard. I'm just curious to the extent that you're restructuring leases, I mean, how are you thinking about -- sort of thinking about what the right sales levels are for these restaurants or other retailers? And are you structuring these more as percentage rent deals? So the new benefit is sales improved for them? Or are you trying to just recut sales at a much lower level? And we reset pace rents? I'm just curious how you guys are sort of thinking about the impact of the retailers and what sort of flexibility they have on new lease terms going forward? Doug Linde : Yes. So Steve, this is Doug. So the only company's work that we're having those types of conversations with are the food service operations, we're not having that conversation with Sephora or with a BonoBos or any of that sort of whatever sort of soft food retailers. With regards to our restaurant retailers, we think that making sure that they are not overpaying when they start to operate makes a lot of sense. And so we are orienting our deals into percentage rent types of clauses for periods of time, with an expectation that should feel good to certain levels, we'll start to get paid back. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Craig Mailman : Hey guys. Just circling back to density. And I'm just curious kind of thoughts here as it relates to, maybe development, demand and pricing here, the ability to pack more people into less space clearly brought down occupancy cost and allowed a new supply some of these higher rents. So just curious what you think early thoughts and just the impact of that could be as you guys look to start either 4th and Harrison or Platform 16, how you go about designing and kind of coming to a potential yield. Owen Thomas : I think it's too early to address that question. I think there are -- as I mentioned, there are a handful of places where we're talking to customers and responding to RFPs. For major requirements 4th and Harrison, 3 Hudson Boulevard are two examples. But I'm not aware that we have had those kinds of impacts in those discussion. So I think it's just too early to suggest that rents are less affordable because of less density. We certainly haven't seen that impact yet. Craig Mailman : Okay. And then, I don't know if you guys have these figures handy, but I'm just curious in terms of your portfolio, specifically, kind of where average tenant densities have gone this cycle maybe knowing that you guys have more law firms in your portfolio that, just getting rid of law libraries would naturally brought down density anyway. Just curious is what you think maybe the impact could ultimately be on your portfolio knowing kind of where tenants are today? Doug Linde : So we actually did a study for our Board in the middle of last year. And it was, I think it was surprisingly interesting to see that while density has come down over time, it has not come down to nearly the extent that people thought it would come down. There are very different density levels for very different types of industries. And that the most interesting, I guess, realization that we came to, was that density is a definition that is hard to get your arms around because there are two different kinds of workers. There are people who you would refer to as traditional workers, who are people that are expected to \"come to their space every day and work in the same space\". And then there are, what you would refer to as dynamic workers, who are people who may not very frequently be in the office, or when they are in the office, they are using different kinds of spaces for different kinds of needs. And so the real issue is going to be how and Owen talked about it earlier, as well as, some of the other questions that were raised, which is how does working from home and/or working remotely impact overall density, because our expectation is, there will actually be a lot more people who are assigned to a particular space, but the way the space is built out may be much more wide open, not in terms of open office. But in terms of giving people elbow room and that space will have a higher density of people who are using it in a different manner, not necessarily on a day to day to day basis. And so it's very hard to sort of understand how those relationships are going to work in the future. But we can tell you that prior to COVID-19 we were seeing significant numbers of people that were assigned to spaces and that we're not using those spaces on a frequent basis, but that viewed themselves as having \"office at a particular location.\" Owen Thomas : I would summarize that by saying that and we were saying this before COVID-19, physical densification is was likely over before COVID-19 densification was coming from increases in occupancy. So I think that will accelerate, I think the physical densification can actually go in the other direction and get more spread out. And I do think they'll continue to be a focus on occupancy, which will be partially facilitated by all the work from home tools that we're all using. Craig Mailman : That's helpful. Then, just one quick one for Mike. As we think about bad debt, you didn't really put a number out there. Just thoughts on where that could ratchet up this cycle. Maybe look at what happened to the financial crisis, and just any significant tenants going on non-accruals that we need to worry about with your cash accounting versus GAAP? Mike LaBelle : We do it on a tenant-by-tenant basis and in Doug's remarks, he really tried to provide some guideposts for those industries that we thought would potentially see more distress. I think Doug came up with accrued rent balances of somewhere in the low 40 million for kind of those areas that we focused on. So that's kind of the number that we're thinking about. I mean, at this point, it's kind of early to determine. Overall, we feel very, very good about the creditworthiness of the overall portfolio. And Doug tried to go through that and you look at the top tenants that we have, they're all very, very strong, again, mature, long-term companies, for the most part. That doesn't mean that something is not going to happen, right? I mean, if you look at the last cycle, the last downturn, which was a different kind of downturn, certainly it was a financial downturn. And I think the financial community is in much better shape this time. But we didn't get credit losses from places that, you wouldn't have necessarily expected, like Lehman Brothers, for example. But, overall, I think we are well positioned. And there's just a few areas where we're monitoring closely. And we wanted to give you that insight that was the whole purpose of providing you some of those numbers to give you some insight. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC. Rich Anderson : Thanks. Good morning. Just on further on that one, Mike. The 40 million accrued rent balance that Doug kind of went through in the office space and then you had this $25 million to $35 million, his range for the office sector that you went through, is that incremental to the starting point, I'm just trying to reconcile those two observations. Mike LaBelle : So I mean, they are separate, because the $25 million to $35 million that I described is basically a reduction of revenue from last quarter's guidance that we gave you that we think we are likely to have because the pace of leasing is slower. So, we expected to have tenants coming in either vacant space, or expiring space where no tenants are leaving, we may have expected those spaces to be filled and starting revenue in 2020. And with what's going on and the lack of ability to kind of do tours and our expectation is a lot of stuff's going to be pushed off. I think it will still be leased, but it may not occur till 2021. And then, from a TI perspective, we have a 30 to 90-day disruption of construction on tenants that we have to wait until they complete their spaces. Until we can start revenue, we've got to push those dates out. So many of those tenants were expected to complete their work at the end of the year, and now they're getting pushed down in 2021. So that was really the $25 million to $35 million, whereas the accrued rent is basically a separate item that at this point, we are comfortable with where our accrued balance is on our balance sheet. But as I said, we're monitoring certain industry sectors that we think are a little bit more exposed. Rich Anderson : Okay, got it. Thanks. When you think about the development pipeline Dock 72 was mentioned earlier, but are there any in your in the pipeline that you look at that maybe not right now, but perhaps down the road if this thing drags out for any length of time that just fundamentally won't work and then you could be looking at like a stoppage and an exit from a project down the road, or do you feel like everything you got on the Dock right now eventually in some way, shape or form will restart depending on how long this thing lasts? Mike LaBelle : We are highly confident that that the developments that we have underway in the Northern Virginia and Maryland marketplaces and in the Greater Boston marketplaces with the credits that we have in place are going to be finished and those tenants are going to continue to pay rent. Obviously, they haven't started their built out of their tenant improvement. Construction, yes, so it may very well be that the way they approach their installation of their own spaces, it is going to change. So the use doesn't work. I'm not sure how you're referring to. From a financial perspective they're going to work. From how they're building out space, I would expect that there will be lessons learned and there will be a pause and a review of those types of improvements so that they can make sure that they're prepared for today as well as tomorrow. But we have no concerns relative to the financial feasibility of the tenants that we have entered into leases with for any other developments. Rich Anderson : Okay, great. Owen Thomas : And also, just I think part of your question was about the prospective pipeline. As I described, we're suspending significant investments in the future pipeline, unless we get a material pre-lease, such that the project would have the same characteristics that Doug described, so they would have been, quote, the risk. Now we do have a very significant land bank of over 10 million fee. And as we've described before, we control a lot of that land not through -- not in all cases, but we try to minimize our cash investment in that portfolio and try to control it more through options or covered land play. So, I don't think we can at this stage piece through every one of those projects and tell you, yes, this is viable, this is not. Bu, again, I remain optimistic about the long-term, this recession, we will work through it. And my guess is these projects will be viable in the future. Again, they're subject to entitlement planning and pre-leasing. Rich Anderson : Okay. Last question for me, the world famous NOI bridge over the past several years. And I'm wondering, do you feel like you kind of just got under the wire there in terms of completing that or will there be some lingering issues perhaps at 399 Park where that might get kicked down a little bit longer? Or do you feel like you kind of got that pretty much buttoned up the nine assets. Doug Linde : Every single space and every single one of those leases is done. And the only question we have in front of us is when the tenants on some of the spaces will actually be occupying their space or having completed their TIs. So that from a revenue recognition perspective, we will have be able to start booking the rent. Interestingly, we will -- in many cases, we will start to see -- we may actually start to see cash rent like we are now in certain cases prior to when that case is done. So, from an economic perspective, we are two years past those issues. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alexandra Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Alexandra Goldfarb : Hey, good morning. So, a few questions first, Doug, in response to your development question on you specifically said Maryland. So I assume that you're comfortable with Marriott and taking their development headquarters in Bethesda. But maybe you could talk a little bit about Under Armour. I don't know if that, if that's part of the 40 million rent accrual. But, is that lease of the GM, is that one of the leases that within discussions for restructuring or, as far as you guys are aware they are current on their expectations to start paying cash rent at the end of the year. Doug Linde : So, we have not added any additional conversations with Under Armour since their last quarterly call. And well, our expectation is that, obviously they're not -- there's no cash rent right now. So there is no \"collection issue\". And we fully expect that they will continue to be a thriving retailer and we'll be in a position to live up to all their commitments. Alexandra Goldfarb : Okay. The second question is from Mike LaBelle. Mike, you guys, you walk through guidance, and you walk through all the variables and why you guys chose to rescind it. At the same time, if we look at your development spending and the fact that you only drew a little bit on your line of credit, it seems that you have a lot more confidence in your ability to fund development and the credit market versus the variability in the income statements. So maybe you could just sort of juxtapose that because a lot of companies are seeming very cautious on their balance sheet in light of COVID, whereas you guys seem to have a lot more confidence in your balance sheet. And your funding is not needing to draw downs heavily have a line of credit, versus the variables that you outlined on rent collection. Mike LaBelle : Alex, I think, as I said, we feel like we entered this period of time in great shape from a balance sheet perspective. Because we raised a lot of capital last year, that doesn't mean that we're not going to continue to think about ways to raise capital, because in periods like this, I don't think you can have too much cash per se. So, we're going to be evaluating all the thing to make sure that we have as much liquidity as possible to go get through this event and then be ready for whatever happens on the other side. I mean, there was talk a minute ago about development starts and whether we would start developments during a recession or after a recession. And if you look at our history, our history is that we don't really start a lot of developments in a recessionary environment that we hold those land parcel we think -- till things improve, but there's other opportunities for the company to invest capital in because there's certain situations where we can be opportunistic. So I think we want to make sure that we have capital available for that. We feel really good about where we are, and feel really good about our access. So we're quite pleased with our partners that work with us on those things. Doug Linde : This is Doug. You shouldn't construe our decision not to provide guidance, with any discomfort with our income, and our receipt of cash and our ability -- our abilities to forecast. You should look at it as the following. In a traditional, non-COVID-19 environment, we would be giving guidance that has a pretty tight range. And the things that we would be thinking about on the margin are, are we going to be able to lease a little bit more space this quarter or this year, when the seven or eight projects that we have under construction going to be completed? And when can we start recognizing the revenue? How many of the renewal conversations that are currently in place are going to happen in this month versus next month, so we can start recognizing the accrued rent balance increase or things like that, right? Those are the kinds of things we sort of deal with when we're coming up with our numbers. We're not dealing with -- we had $40 million of transients -- parking revenue. And in the month of April and May it went to negligible numbers because people were told they weren't allowed to go to work. Or we had a hotel that was operating instead of that $14 million, $13 million or $12 million and suddenly we closed the hotel, right? So the economic uncertainties associated with what's going on, or what is giving us pause to provide, \"a guidance level.\" And I don't think you should consider that is any reflection on our comfort level with our income on a relative basis relative to our balance sheet. So we're -- those are sort of two discrete issues. Alexandra Goldfarb : Okay. Thank you. Owen Thomas : And I would add to Doug's point. The other thing I was trying to make the point in my remarks, the future is also science driven. There's rumors about a new therapy or drug for COVID-19 and markets rally and everyone gets excited. And then there's new news, but it didn't work. They're factors that are going to drive the economic outcome that are not economically driven, they're science driven and they're harder for us to estimate the timing and the impact. So that was certainly the driver of the decision. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Derek Johnston : Hi, everyone. Thank you. So what are some of the increased expenses, including new technology systems that you expect to incur from let's say, new practices or procedures, that you're putting in place to fully reopen? Can you share any details on these expenses and systems and any options to reduce G&A and potentially offset? Doug Linde : So, this is Doug. Let me just give you comments. So much of what we are going to be doing are going to be standard operating procedures and uses of different materials and different processes, in accessing and cleaning our buildings and moving air around our buildings. The vast majority of that will be showing up in changes to operating the expenses. And so there's not a lot of \"new technology\" associated with that. But the one area that we're considering and we haven't made final decisions on are temperature checks and effectively thermal screening. And again, those are -- that is not a high tech instrument at the moment, we're not looking at doing thermal screenings relative to having the types of screens that you're seeing in airports in China and things like that, because quite frankly, they're not available. And the technology's not at a point where we're comfortable laying it out. So I think in the short-term, the cost increases will go -- will be seen in our operating expense side of our income statement, not on the CapEx side of it. And we have to be thoughtful about making sure we're doing the right amount of health, safety work and not be so concerned about dollar cost until we're really satisfied that we're giving people the best possible environment to work in. They're also held in, as you suggested in your question, operating expense saving during a crisis because obviously the buildings are less occupied. So tower users just down, certain tenants wanted to have less janitorial so that expenses down. So there have been some savings that have occurred on the OpEx related to the lower occupancy. Derek Johnston : Okay, great. And can you comment on your pipeline how it looks today versus how it looks pre-COVID, do you believe that demand will return to previous levels maybe late in 2020 or, tended to be pushed out to 2021 or is it still may be a disconnect? Doug Linde : As I discussed in my remarks that -- when I assume when you say demand, you talk about leasing. Since the crisis started, as I mentioned, new requirements, other than a handful of developments that we're working on are few and far between very limited tour activity. We are having success completing leases that work underway before the pandemic. So, I think for leasing volumes to return, you have to decide what economic scenario is going to unfold over the next year. So I've described three in my remark, the base case being we have a slow return to work over the next couple of months, and then there's some kind of medical solution or some kind of solution where people feel safe by 2021. And I think if the safety occurred, yes, I think we can go back to a pre-pandemic level of leasing sometime next year. But, there are other outcomes that could slow that down or speed it up. Mike LaBelle : And in the financial projections that I went over what was the assumption that we made was that we were not going to be doing any additional incremental leasing in 2020. So that can sort of give you a baseline on that number relevant to '19 and then obviously, to the extent that we're increasing occupancy in 2021. And then, you can make an assumption for what that means from a revenue perspective. But look, the fact of the matter is, as Owen said, physical tour activity is non-existent today. There's a little bit of virtual leasing that's going on and that just means everything's going to get postponed, right? But there are lease explorations in the marketplace to happen every single year. And those lease expirations are going to require leasing activity be a renewals or be a moves to different locations. Again, as Owen described, that may be very possible that if we're in a recession, many companies will say, I'd rather not spend the money on the new installation. I'm not entirely sure what that new installation should look like. And I'm just going to renew for a year or two years or three years or something short-term. So it's hard to say how that leasing activity will manifest itself, but it will happen. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi. Michael Bilerman : Hey, it's Michael Bilerman here with Manny. I had a few topics that I wanted to go over the first, Owen in your comments, you talked about looking at potential acquisitions and maybe setting planting some seeds today to look at something maybe down the road. And you also commented about reset pricing referring to deal that happened pre-COVID and when sellers need to reset their expectations? So you clearly were active post the GFC, think about the GM building, Macklowe portfolio that you purchased. What do you need to see to become aggressive, right? So what are the goalposts from a pricing perspective? What do you need to see in the market to actually go out and try to transact? And how active are you doing that today? Owen Thomas : Yes. So I would say that, in general, we are going into a recession and that usually creates, as I mentioned in my remarks, reductions in rents and reductions in values for certain types of buildings. We do have a lot lower interest rate, which is very helpful. So I do think that it's likely that as a result of this crisis, we will identify an interesting acquisition opportunity as a result. So your question on timing today is too early. This just started six weeks ago. There's a period of time where that -- where the market needs to settle and new pricing needs to be established. So we are simply staying in the market, making sure we understand what's going on, trying to understand any new leases that gets done, whereas the rental rate, those types of things. But I think our desire to pursue something is months away. I think the drivers of it Michael will be first, which of those economic scenarios that I described in my opening remarks. When do we know which one of those we're on, because that's going to have a big impact on how this recovery goes. So we're going to want some more clarity on that. And then second, I think it would be helpful to have some new leasing activity and maybe some other transaction activity so we understand valuation. But we think they're going to be interesting opportunities and we want to be well prepared for that. Michael Bilerman : You talked a little bit about, the different sectors that are getting impacted by this energy and oil being one of them. Number of your partners that you have in from a joint venture perspective highly tied to the oil market in terms of their wealth and their denominator effect, obviously, is taking a pretty big hit. How do you sort of see those sovereigns acting in this, does that provide you opportunities to buy back stakes in your existing ventures at attractive pricing, if they need to liquidity? Will there be other sort of distressed sellers coming out of this, where you may not have all the answers to how everything is going to transpire. But you do have capital and history where you may want to act before you have everything in place because by the way, once everything is known, the markets already corrected. Owen Thomas : Yes. Look, I agree with your last statement is, you can't wait for it to be perfect because it's too late. Look, I think your question on different investors and what their behavior will be during this crisis is very case specific. As you said, there are certain sovereign investors that are driven by oil revenues. And my guess is that will have some bearing on their appetite to do new business or maybe even to change the composition to their portfolios. We don't know the answer to that. I think another factor is, how is the -- what is the performance? What did that sovereign invest in? What did that portfolio look like? How is it performed? And how does that affect the appetite of that investor for further investment? I think that's part of it. As I mentioned in my remarks, we are staying active in the private equity market talking to major investors and understanding their interest level and I would say it before, the most part, there is still enthusiasm for investing in U.S. real estate and an appreciation for the dynamics of the market and the opportunities that are going to result. So, obviously not a lot of deals are getting done right now. So these investors haven't been able to demonstrate from -- in terms of writing checks, their desire to do this, but there's certainly a lot of enthusiasm and interest in pursuing the opportunities as they arrive. Michael Bilerman : And the second topic is, just going back to the whole office utilization. And I appreciate the fact that you split it into both the near term, which is clearly impacted by a recessionary environment as well as the social distancing aspects and more of a longer term. And so I wanted to focus in on the longer term where I think you've talked about that there -- you don't anticipate a wholesale change in the way office demand is going to be used. And I understand that from a Boston Properties perspective, your portfolio is very high quality and on a relative basis, you should fare better given the investments that you're making, all the air quality and space and management of your buildings. But putting that part aside, really just trying to understand the dynamics from an office utilization perspective, you have 100% of corporate America that is going through this trial and experiment of having people work from home. And I would think that coming out of it that we're not going to go back to 100%, of office normalcy, that there could be some levels of more willingness to have people in remote locations. So incremental net hiring will not translate into the same level of square footage per employee. Again, post-COVID, right, where we're not having social distancing. Just a level of willingness and then maybe there's more satellite offices because you realize you can get good employees that can be productive, not have the time -- not have the cost of commute or the time to commute. Maybe we'll take care of and have more childcare and things like that. I don't see why there wouldn't be a wholesale change in the way office is being used in the future. Owen Thomas : Yes. Michael, I would address your question in the following manner in terms of thinking about the future. First question is, are we in markets where there are industries that are growing, is that the most important thing that the customers are growing their businesses and they are need -- they're going to hire new people and they need more space. So I think that the key driver number one. Number two, what's the densification of the build out? And I firmly believe that the desertification I frankly, we thought it was over before the crisis. We thought occupancies were going up but physical densification was stopped. I think there's no doubt that densification is going to go in the other direction as a result of this crisis and as a result of some frustration some of our customers were having with their debt environments, even before the crisis. So I think that's a change. And then the third is, what you're talking about, which is work from home and the ability for companies or groups within companies to work together in remote location. And look, I agree with you, I think that we've all gotten better at it, we understand the power of the tool. And I think we also understand what's not great about it in terms of being with colleague? Can you really manage and lead an organization or a group remotely over the long term? Can a company build culture by not being in person over the long-term? Is it really more efficient for everyone to be working remotely? I think these are the questions that business leaders are going to have to answer for themselves as they work through the question that you postulate. So I'm not saying things aren't going to change, things always change in real estate and in the use of office buildings. But again, I think the viability of the office is not questioned, by what we're experiencing. Michael Bilerman : Okay. And then just on a short-term basis, if you looked at the square foot per employee, for your footprint today, when you impose the social distancing in that environment, what percentage of the workforces could come back, right? So do you believe in the current construct that with a six foot social distance in use of the assets that your current tenants can only bring back let's say, 50% of the employees and amount to it, or is it 75? Or is it only 25? Where I guess in your planning, what percentage of employees could come back and still be safe? Owen Thomas : I think that is hard to answer, Michael because it is highly dependent on the physical workspace that a customer is in. I mean, we've got some customers that are primarily in individual offices and they don't have to adjust at all. And there are others that are in bench seating and packed in at 100 square feet per person or less So, I can't give you a finite number answer to that question. Michael Bilerman : Okay. Thank you. Owen Thomas : Okay. No, I can't give a final answer. I can tell you that the issues with people's installations, our customers installations are not necessarily contained just in where their physical sitting, their seat is, right? How is the space set up? And are there, how do you provide services, how do you deal with bathrooms, all the other sort of ancillary areas which are the things that we're thinking about. And so I think it's going to be a little bit of a test case. And people are going to sort of figure it out as they go. And I would expect people will have the operating with an abundance of caution. And so they will make sure that they don't put themselves in situations where lots of people are congregating in enclosed small areas. And so to the extent that there are concerns about that, that will limit the number of people who are coming back at any one particular time not necessarily during a day, but you may see people elongating the work hour and the work day and/or asking people to come in at different hours, not necessarily moving, from floor to floor, if at all possible. And there are all kinds of operating procedures that I expect people and businesses will create to allow people to come back feel comfortable, most importantly and safe, where they are and get accustomed to the situation where until, again, there's a medical treatment and/or vaccine puts people in a much better and healthy perspective. Michael Bilerman : That's helpful. If I can just sneak one quickly from LaBelle just in terms of the financing side of it from a non-guidance perspective, or you -- should we expect an unsecured -- a large unsecured debt offering to take out the 2021 bonds and also build up additional cash liquidity? And would you have a sense of timing? You talked a bit about sort of where rates are, so I didn't know if you're sort of tipping your hand a little bit to doing an unsecured debt issuance from that. Mike LaBelle : Michael, we're always as you know almost every year we're looking ahead to deal with our debt maturities before they happen. So this year is no different than that. We do think about what the volatility in the markets might be depending on different outcomes with respect to the economic environment. And the COVID-19 virus, if you get bad news, what's it going to do with the bond market? What does that mean? So, we're always thinking about those things. I can't say whether we're going to do any kind of capital raise or not. But, it's not out of character for us in the back half of a year, if we have a debt maturity in the first half of the following year, to be starting to think about that and thinking about what windows of time in the market might make sense. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Blaine Heck : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Clearly, there's a more cautious stance emerging on the development side of things, land values are typically the first to decline in these situations. Do you guys have any sort of thoughts on the magnitude of that decrease in land values? And do you think there'll be any opportunity throughout this crisis to find land sites that significant discounts that maybe you didn't want to reach for in the last few years to kind of lengthen that potential development runway as we come out of this? Or, is your focus mainly going to be on more of the existing buildings, whether they be stabilize the value-add? Owen Thomas : I think you're right. I think the land values used in a downturn get impacted more negatively than building, understandably, they don't generate cash flow. And it is a possibility, that there may be a site that we identify at an attractive price during this downturn. So I think most of the remarks I've made about chasing new opportunities that cycle were more directed at existing buildings, which is something that as you know, we've been more reluctant to do in the up market. So that could be a switch. But yes, we will be looking at sites as well. Blaine Heck : In many specific markets that you guys might be targeting? Owen Thomas : Well, we -- I think the opportunities for new investment, whether they be site or what I'd call bottom up. They're very opportunity specific. What is the building? What is the opportunity? What is the insight that we have? What is the relationship we have with the seller, those tend to drive the decisions as much as anything. But as, from our development pipeline and the deals that we've done, pre-pandemic, we have been focusing on California, we have been focusing on Boston, and less so on New York and Washington DC. And pursuant to my remarks earlier, where we think the industry that are going to perform better are primarily government and maybe more importantly, life sciences and technology. I think that when we would have more confidence in them after the cycle that would probably dictate what areas would be of more interest to us on the margin. Blaine Heck : All right, great. That's helpful. Then maybe for Doug. Can you just talk about the Fannie Mae situation? And how were they able to decrease their commitment to the rest in gateway development? Was that something you guys agreed on mutually just given some of the other activity you mentioned on that project? Or was there some sort of construction milestone maybe that wasn't met that opened up that optionality? Just any color on that situation would be helpful? Doug Linde : Sure. So the project is way ahead of schedule. And Fannie Mae when they negotiated their lease negotiated for the right to give back, 85,000 square feet of space, I think that's the right number. And so they had a contractual right. As part of their original lease discussion, interestingly, we're in conversations with another tenant who wants all of that space plus the remaining space in the building. And then, we're actually trying to figure out whether or not we'll have enough space to accommodate both Fannie Mae's growth in the future if they needed it as well as other tenants. And we're working actually, on those types of issues, as opposed to worrying about Fannie Mae not needing their space or having any outs in the lease. So there's actually a lot of positive things going on with it right now. Owen Thomas : Yes. The other thing I would just say is, when you do a deal that size that was one of the largest non-government leases ever in the state of Virginia, but if you do a deal that size, it's not uncommon for the customer to have the right at some point during the development to give back or to take more space. It's usually -- obviously a small percentage of the total commitment, but it's not uncommon to provide that to a customer as they determine what their space needs are during the term of the development. So, just want to add that to Doug's remarks. Blaine Heck : Yes. No, that makes sense. Are there any other situations where you have a tenant that is committed to space and either your development pipeline or maybe even signed leases that haven't commenced? And they have the optionality to either decrease or increase their requirements? Owen Thomas : In our development pipeline there are no such requirements like that in our portfolio of 45 million square feet or in service properties, lots of tenants have contraction rights in their leases, based upon notice and timeframes. And those are just an ordinary course of business lease discussion that gets negotiated on a deal by deal basis. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Good morning. A number of companies in the media tech industries have already announced that employees are not coming back to work until at least September. I'm wondering if you're seeing this portfolio at all. And, whether or not it's September of earlier, do you anticipate more office tenants will be requesting either abatement [indiscernible] deferral? Owen Thomas : So, that's a very broad question. I'll try and give a broad answer. In some of our markets, some of our tenants have made those types of, I guess releases and in other markets, we actually have tenants who are telling us that they're going to be coming back earlier than then we would have expected and we're actually making accommodations for them filling the buildings up before we are in a position where we can really roll out all the things that we would like to roll out. So it is very much a market by market determinant. The concept of abatement or deferment really isn't the one that we're talking about with regards to office tenants, other than in a very unique situation where a particular customer has significant financial challenges at the moment and where we think it's constructive for us to be helpful. John Kim : I'm just wondering if that becomes the industry norm and a lot of companies not going back to the workplace in a five or six month timeframe. How many of them can actually stay current on the web? Owen Thomas : Well, if they're not going back to the office and they're actually working, presumably they're working because they have revenues and/or business operations that would allow them to continue to work on a remote basis. So I'm not sure if it necessarily impacts their financial viability. Obviously, if it's a retail organization or a consumer product organization that would have a brick and mortar selling channel, that's a substantial amount of what they're doing. That's a different situation. But I'm not aware, for example, about a media company that's telling their people that they can't go back to work, they shouldn't go back to their office that that is not in a very strong revenue situation. John Kim : Okay. And the leases that you signed in April, were there any changes to the lease term, but it's the COVID-19 signed across any pandemic related clauses for instance? Owen Thomas : So, to-date, we have not seen any COVID-19 clauses, we do expect that going forward, there will be a realization that this not unlike terrorism, risk insurance and issues associated with those types of problems will have to get addressed in leases and will have to figure out what the right industry mechanism for dealing with those that will be in and to-date it has not occurred. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya with Mizuho. Omotayo Okusanya : Yes. Good morning. Just a couple of quick one, call is running long. This may not be on people's minds anymore, given everything that's happening with the pandemic, but any thoughts about the Prop 13 split roll now that we're getting closer and closer to the national elections. Owen Thomas : Rob Pester, are you on the line? Rob Pester : Yes. I'm here. Yes, it will be on the ballot. The polling that we're seeing right now shows that it will not pass -- I think California per se people are tired of the increased taxes, so we don't see it passing. Omotayo Okusanya : Got you. That's helpful. And then, the other question I wanted to ask is, just on the accounting for the JV with Alexandria, could you walk us through with the 50% ownership? Are you going to consolidate that, is Alexandria going to consolidate that or how's that going to work? Mike LaBelle : This is Mike. I don't want to speak for what Alexandria is accounting is, but our accounting is, we will treat it as an unconsolidated joint venture. And so that's how we'll treat it. We treated it as kind of a contribution of 50% of our properties into that and as you might have noticed, there was a pretty significant gain on that contribution for our gateway assets, which is really a non-cash gain because it went right into acquiring their share -- their 50% share of their assets. So that's kind of how the transaction is accounted for. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Abramowitz with Jefferies. Peter Abramowitz : Hi, thank you. I just want to ask a small question on your parking other income. What's the breakdown for the parking income? How much is month-to-month and how much is kind of built into the leases? Doug Linde : So, I think I gave a number for 2019. And I said, we had $113 million in total and $40 million of it was transient or hourly parking, that's about as much break down as we can give you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Ismail with Green Street Advisors. Daniel Ismail : Great, thank you. Other than a few immediate reports lately on the MTA sites and I was hoping to see if you can provide any update on the status of that transaction. Owen Thomas : John Powers, you are still on? John Powers : I'm still on, yes. It seems that our governor, when our mayor in the midst of this decided that they would move forward and made a deal on how the tax revenue would be distributed. And that's been holding this up to us for a couple of years. So we're going forward but we have to go through a whole unit process there. So this is a multi-year project. Daniel Ismail : Okay. So still not close but advanced a little further? John Powers : Advanced further, yes, it will take more time multi-years. Daniel Ismail : Great. And then just a follow-on from that, state and local budgets are clearly under pressure in this environment, which might be a driver of you permitting the rezoning. Are there any short or long-term opportunities here for Boston Properties say at the Santa Monica Business Park, for instance? Owen Thomas : Danny, I think it's an interesting question. And I think you're right, it could potentially create some opportunities in a lot of different areas. I think the situation at the MTA that John just went through perhaps is one of them, in other words, a project that that all of a sudden, we've made a lot of headway on. I think it's too early to conjecture what those might be, but I don't disagree with the concept. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Nick Yulico : Thanks. Just I want to ask about sublease space in your portfolio and in any markets where you are, maybe on a real-time basis if you're seeing any pickup in sublease space? Doug Linde : So, Nick, this is Doug. The only place that we have immediately seen some pickup has been in San Francisco, where there were actually some organizations that were planning on subletting space and it's come to the market, I think more quickly based upon COVID-19, and their employment headcounts, but we have not seen any significant [lot] [ph] of space come on the market in our other locations to-date. I mean, again, that the fact that there's no \"physical tour activity,\" I'm guessing has probably created a situation where there's not an impending need to quickly put some space on the market and the company is thinking about that, because there's nothing -- it's not actionable at the moment. Nick Yulico : Okay, thanks. Just one follow-up on that is, if you had any update on Macy's at 680 Folsom, I think they were planning to sublease that space, any latest thoughts there? Owen Thomas : Yes. So we actually we checked in and there's no \"lease yet\" that we're aware of on the Macy's.com space at 680 Folsom Street. I think that, again, that space was put on the market pre-COVID-19 as they made a decision to move those people to a different location from a regional perspective. And so what we anticipate that that space will still be on the sublet market and it's great space and that it will lease whether the economics hold for what Macy's thought they were going to get relative to where they will ultimately do a deal. That's hard to defend. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time would you like to continue with closing remarks? Owen Thomas : Thank you very much operator. Our call is pushing two hours. So I'm going to minimize my closing remarks and simply thanking everyone for staying with us for all these minutes and your interest in Boston Properties. Thank you everyone. Operator : This concludes today's Boston Properties conference call. Thank you again for attending and have a good day.",

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Sara Buda, VP of Investor Relations for Boston Properties. Please go ahead. Sara Buda : Great. Thank you, and welcome, everybody, to the Boston Properties Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. The press release and supplemental package were distributed last night and furnished on Form 8-K. In the supplemental package, the company has reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G. If you did not receive a copy, these documents are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at investors.bxp.com. A webcast of this conference call will be made available for 12 months. At this time, we'd like to inform you that certain statements made during this conference call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, and although Boston Properties believes the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we cannot assure you that the expectations will be attained. Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements were detailed in yesterday's press release and from time to time in the company's filings with the SEC. In particular, there are significant risks and uncertainties related to the scope, severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures on Boston properties and our tenants. Boston Properties does not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements. I would like to welcome Owen Thomas, Chief Executive Officer; Doug Linde, President; and Mike LaBelle, Chief Financial Officer. During the Q&A portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, Senior Executive Vice President, and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions. I'd now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks. Owen Thomas : Thank you, Sara, and good morning, everyone. I'm joining you today from Boston Properties Office in New York, where I've been working for almost a month, and it's great to be back. Our offices in Boston; Washington, D.C.; and obviously, New York City are open. And many of our employees have elected to join their property management colleagues and return to the office. Our buildings remain under 10% physically occupied at this time, but we anticipate some increase after Labor Day, as we and our customers are anxious to safely return to work in the months ahead. Despite a challenging environment, Boston Properties continued to perform in the second quarter and beat consensus earnings by $0.02, excluding charges. We also collected 98% of our office rents, 94% of our rents overall and completed 942,000 square feet of new leases and renewals, including a 400,000 square foot new lease with Microsoft at Reston Town Center. These achievements demonstrate the resilience of our business model in a difficult operating environment. I'm particularly proud of our team's commitment to serving our customers with the highest level of professionalism that is our standard at Boston Properties. This morning, I will focus my comments in three areas; the status and timing of the U.S. economic recovery, the future of office demand and Boston Properties' pivot to offense. The recovery of the U.S. and global economies is directly tied to the course of the pandemic. COVID-19 infection rates remain at elevated levels in the U.S. as many Americans appear to be less willing to follow the health safety protocols mandated by the CDC and local governments. As a result, COVID-19 will likely linger in the U.S. and around certain regions of the world for some time. Though a federal CARES two Act will help, the U.S. economic recovery has been extended out further and will likely not be able to return to a full new normal until therapeutics or a vaccine are developed. To date, there have been significant strides made toward the development of a vaccine with multiple biopharma companies currently in Phase III trials ending in late fall. The federal Operation Warp Speed has invested over $6 billion in the manufacturing of vaccine doses, in advance of full approvals. A successful vaccine is not expected to be broadly available until year-end 2020 at the earliest and more likely well into 2021. Moving to the future of office. Much has been written and speculated about the pandemic effect on office use, which is understandable given the high percentage of employees still working from home and the resultant low physical occupancies of office buildings. To fully evaluate what has and could transpire, you have to consider the four key drivers of office demand : employment, location, density and occupancy driven by work from home and look at each of these factors during and after the pandemic. So starting with employment. The pandemic has created significant job losses and other recessionary effects that are a headwind for office demand in many industry sectors. Many companies are looking to cut costs, CEOs are hesitant to invest capital in new space and leasing volumes have slowed considerably. However, employment loss for office workers is 6%, which is well below the national average of 16% overall as many of the job losses were in the service and hospitality sectors. Further, economic recovery, though recently stalled, has begun with recent jobs data showing employers have reinstated in May and June over 1/3 of the jobs lost over the prior two months. All recessions eventually come to an end, and we are confident that new space demand will return as the economy recovers. Further, several industries, particularly tech and life science, are performing well through the pandemic. And Boston Properties' existing assets and developments are intentionally well positioned for this customer base. Location preference is another driver of office demand, and there has been speculation about companies moving out of the major urban environments to smaller, less expensive cities. To date, we have not seen evidence of this behavior among our customer base and remain confident our cities will continue to be a location of choice for talented knowledge workers and the companies that employ them. I acknowledge the challenging budget deficits large cities face as a result of the crisis are an obstacle urbanization will need to overcome once again. There's also been speculation about corporate movement from city to suburban locations. This does not appear to be true for this does appear to be true for residential demand, as housing market conditions are strengthening for commutable suburban locations. But we have yet to see evidence of companies looking to move their offices to suburban locations as a result of the pandemic. Moving to densification. This is clearly a trend that is completely reversed during the pandemic period as companies are limiting workstation occupancy and actively spreading out employees for health security purposes. Though the urgency and magnitude of physical spacing may diminish after the pandemic, we do believe a reversal of densification trends will be a tailwind for office demand longer term. Finally, work from home, a key driver of office occupancy has been a surprisingly serviceable way to conduct business during the pandemic. But many of our tenants and other large corporates believe it is not a long-term sustainable substitute for in-person work. As time wears on, it is increasingly clear to business leaders there are widening gaps for their companies in activities such as collaboration, creativity, training, mentoring and the building of company culture, when all employee communication and connection is virtual. We have heard from countless customers and business leaders about these shortcomings and their desire to return to in-person work. Though company and business function specific, I do believe there will be greater acceptance and adoption of part-time work from home for a larger segment of the workforce as an additive tool. It may act as a headwind to office demand growth, but will not be a full replacement of the office environment. Overall, though the pandemic and associated recession are challenging office demand in the short term, we are confident office markets in Gateway cities will recover their vibrancy over time. Now moving to Boston Properties' activities. Over the past several months, we have been aggressively responding to the challenges of the pandemic, including collecting rent, restructuring leases with customers in need, ensuring the health security of our employees and customers and raising capital. These activities continue, but we are also selectively and proactively investing in our future growth. We continue to invest in our development pipeline, which currently stands at 10 development and redevelopment projects comprising five million aggregate square feet and $2.8 billion in total investment. The commercial component of this portfolio is 74% preleased with aggregate projected cash yields at stabilization of approximately 7%. In June, we completed the acquisition of the site at Fourth and Harrison in San Francisco for $140 million, or $174 per developable square foot. The 500,000 square foot first phase of this project has fully completed entitlements and plans, though we are not planning speculative construction in the current environment. Last week, we entered into a joint venture with Continental Development Corporation to acquire a 50% interest in their Beach Cities Media Campus development on Rosecrans Avenue in El Segundo, California for $21 million. The site has the potential for a 275,000 square foot development, which will not commence until the project is fully designed and market conditions justify commencement of construction. This investment is the next, albeit modest, step in the growth of our Los Angeles region and shifts our attention to our core competency of office development. Given adjacencies to the very attractive Beach Cities residential areas and LAX, we believe in the strength of the El Segundo market, particularly along Rosecrans Avenue, its most vibrant district. We are excited and honored to form this first partnership with Continental, the leading property company in the local market. Both parties, who share core values, anticipate the relationship will grow over time. We also continue to monitor our five core markets and Seattle for value-added investment opportunities where we can utilize our real estate operating platform to create value. These investments are primarily being pursued with private equity partners. So far, during this recession, there have been fairly limited opportunities. I would describe the market as \"in discovery mode,\" as transaction volumes for office assets are down 66% from the first quarter. Sellers are holding out for prepandemic pricing given lower interest rates and the financing market is reasonably healthy, allowing many owners to refinance. There were a small number of transactions that closed in our markets over the last quarter, providing evidence of continued liquidity and perhaps marginally higher cap rates. In Boston, a leasehold interest in 27 Drydock Avenue in the Seaport District sold for $270 million, which was $932 a square foot and a mid-5% cap rate. This 289,000 square-foot building is 97% leased and sold to a domestic pension fund and its manager. In San Francisco, the Townsend Building, which is a renovated early 1900s assets, in the SOMA District, recently sold for $138 million, a little over $1,000 a square foot and a low-5% cap rate. This 137,000 square-foot building was under contract to sell earlier in the year for approximately 9% more, but the original buyer defaulted forfeiting a deposit. The building is fully leased and sold to an investment manager. And lastly, in the San Jose CBD, 160 West Santa Clara sold for $138 million or a little over $1,000 a square foot and a 5.2% cap rate. This 212,000 square-foot building was sold to a private investor through a like kind exchange. We are increasingly focusing on the life science sector, given the strong and resilient growth in user demand. Boston Properties is already well positioned for this industry with over 3.2 million square feet of office space leased to life science tenants and over five million square feet of new development and redevelopment opportunities in Boston and San Francisco. These two markets, where we have leading office market positions, are the top two life science clusters in the country due to their proximity to important academic institutions and research hospitals and dominant market share of venture capital and NIH funding for life sciences. Finally, despite the pandemic, we continue to raise capital and upgrade our portfolio through the sale of noncore assets. This quarter, we completed the sale of a 455,000 square foot divided interest in Capital Gallery in the Southwest Washington, D.C. CBD to the Smithsonian Institution for $254 million. Boston Properties retained 176,000 square feet in the East Tower of the complex consisting of office and retail space, a parking garage and development capacity. Boston Properties will continue to provide property management services to Smithsonian, which retains various leasing and purchase rights for the portion of the East Tower not conveyed. We also completed the sale of our 50% interest in Annapolis Junction Eight, a 126,000 square foot vacant office building and two land parcels at the Annapolis Junction Office Park in suburban Maryland to a user for a gross sale price of $47 million. To conclude, 2020 has clearly been a trying period for many types of real estate due to both the recession and physical distancing requirements of the pandemic. Fortunately, for Boston properties, we have long lease terms, minimal lease rollover the next few years and strong liquidity to invest opportunistically. All recessions and pandemics eventually end, and we are confident longer term in the U.S. economy, in major cities and the importance of the in-person workplace. Boston Properties has the franchise, capital and business strategy to emerge from the pandemic with strength and momentum. So let me turn the call over to Doug in Boston. Thank you. Doug Linde : Good morning, everybody. So Mike LaBelle, Sara Buda and I are all sitting together more than six feet apart at our corporate office at the Prudential Center. And we've been here since June 1. So we're on, I guess, our 9th week. It certainly feels a lot longer than 90 days since we had our last conference call. And I think Sara has organized calls or group meetings with more than 200 investors and analysts since late April, and she's also put out updates on a monthly basis. As Owen discussed in his remarks, the business environment that has arisen because of COVID-19's induced economic shutdown is the thing that we are most focused on, on a day-to-day basis in our business. While we are encouraged by the government and the life science industry's determination to test, manufacture and mass distribute a vaccine, we still have to manage the realities of the gradual ramp-up of daily activities schools, day care, commuting, shopping, dining, leisure activities and business, the immediate damage that has been inflicted on the economy and how it's going to impact the utilization of space. The health and safety of our employees, our tenants, our service providers and our visitors continues to be first and foremost on our minds. Almost 90 days ago, we published our Health Security Plan and our assets are all positioned to provide a safe environment for workers based on CDC and local government regulations. We have had hundreds of group and one-on-one conversations with our tenants regarding their plans to bring their workforces back to the office. Our first market to remove shelter-in-place requirements was Massachusetts in late May, and in early June, the city of Boston, and we are now in Phase III in Massachusetts. However, governmental leaders continue to encourage businesses to work from home and the census in our buildings, both suburban and urban, continues to be very light. Our suburban Boston portfolio includes over five million square feet in 33 single- to 6-story buildings. Virtually every tenant employee drives a single occupant vehicle and the elevators get infrequent use. The census there is under 8%. At the moment, the return to work is not about transportation and it's not about elevators. We are seeing similar census levels in the greater D.C. and New York City markets, which have also left lifted their shelter-in-place orders. While a number of our retail tenants have reopened with volume restrictions, traffic is subdued and some of the food service and other amenities remain closed. Parking utilization is up sequentially in May and June, but it is still a fraction of its pre-COVID levels, and our Cambridge Hotel remains closed. Last quarter, I described our revenue components and my remarks this morning are organized around those themes. This is our first exclusive COVID quarter. Our office revenue continued to perform as we expected. The portfolio ended the second quarter of 2020 at 92% occupied as compared to 92.9% in the first quarter. As Owen said, collections were really good at 98%, and they were the same in April, May, June and in July. These statistics include the nonpayment of Ascena Ann Taylor's parent company during this entire period in the second quarter. Mike is going to talk about our accrued rent on our A/R charges in his remarks. I want to make one note about our reported statistics. We have a few large retail tenants in addition to Ascena that have not paid rent that were put into default and when they didn't cure their defaults, we terminated their leases. This totals over 700,000 square feet. As long as these tenants refuse to relinquish possession, we have no ability to relet their space, and we are showing it as occupied and expiring in the subsequent quarter, but we are not recording any income and footnoting these spaces as tenants in sufferance. During our last call and in the updates that we provided during the quarter, we discussed the completion of some of our large leases that got signed in Reston, 535,000 square feet; suburban Boston, a 123,000 square feet; and New York City, 35,000 square feet, they all started pre-COVID. The remainder of the activity was small leases under 10,000 square feet for the quarter. Don't lose sight that our business also includes our operating assets and our development projects. We continue to negotiate a 250,000 square foot lease for the majority of the remaining space at Reston next. We've made four distinct life science and office proposals in excess of 200,000 square feet each on our portfolio of potential new development sites in Waltham in the last couple of months. And earlier this month, we made a proposal and did a virtual presentation to one million square foot user with a mid-2020's delivery time frame for three Hudson Boulevard. Some long-range planning activities continue despite the current health and economic uncertainty. However, our customers are focused primarily on their employee's safety and on the uncertainty of the impact of the economic shutdown on their businesses. Facilities professionals and their brokerage advisors are showing limited interest right now and actively pursuing transactions that don't revolve around an immediate expiration since their business unit leaders have very little forecasting conviction. There are very few post-COVID new transactions that have occurred in any of our markets. Where action is necessary, many tenants are executing short-term extensions. On July 1, as an example, we completed a 110,000 square foot 15-month extension with a tenant at the General Motors Building that had an early 2022 expiration. That tenant was negotiating for a relocation and COVID-19 resulted in a reevaluation of that decision. And last week, we completed a one year extension for a 70,000 square foot tenant at 510 Madison Avenue, extending that expiration to early 2023. Anyone that tells you they know that rents have moved blank percent or that concessions are up blank dollars has no transaction volume to back up their views. It's simply a prediction. It's absolutely true that there is more sublet space on the market in all of our regions and in most submarkets, conditions are going to be weaker. There are a number of technology companies located in San Francisco and Boston that primarily serve the travel and the transportation, hospitality, retail and food service industries that have seen a dramatic impact on their revenues due to the shutdown and those have resulted in large headcount reductions; again, getting back to the pandemic impacting the economy. Many of the large block additions in the inventory come directly from these companies. Some examples are Airbnb and Uber in San Francisco and TripAdvisor and Toast in Boston. However, the majority of the sublet space is in small units with short-term expirations, but it's going to impact the market. To date, San Francisco has had the largest relative increase in sublet space, while New York City has limited space been added to its availability. I want to repeat that the foundation of Boston Properties' ongoing revenues and cash flow is our contractual office lease book of business with an average lease length that still is over eight years at 8.1 years. Our baseline office revenue for the second quarter before write-outs write-offs, excuse me, was $600 million. The remainder of 2020 assumes virtually no additional leasing other than renewals, similar to the transactions I described earlier, a minimal contribution from the 529,000 square feet of space that we've already delivered, but where the tenant is controlling the timing of occupancy and GAAP revenue recognition. We have expected move-outs of about one million square feet with an average rent of $54 a square foot with about three months on average left. Finally, the second half of 2020 revenue figures include the six months of contribution from 17Fifty Market Street in Reston versus three months in the first half. This is the only 2020 office development that was not in 2019. So if you put all this stuff together, we have consolidated office rental revenue contribution, including our share of unconsolidated JVs for the second half of 2020 of about $1.2 billion. This would translate to 2020 full year baseline revenue, about 1% higher than 2019. The reopening of urban consumer bricks-and-mortar retail, including fast, casual and sitdown dining is going to be slow. After breaking out our financial institutions, our technology, our telecom tenants with retail operations, our remaining brick-and-mortar retail cash revenue was about $12.5 million per month pre-COVID, so about 5% of total revenue. This is made up of 275 tenants with more than 40% in the fast, casual and sitdown restaurant sectors, the rest being soft goods and other amenities. During the month of July, we collected about 50% of our bricks-and-mortar retail cash rents relative to their pre-COVID basis. We continue to work with our food service and our other service amenities on ways to assist them in their reopening and in many cases, we are moving to an interim percentage rent arrangement as well as cash accounting, as Mike will discuss. Retail sales are not going to get back to their 2019 levels in 2020, and we know that our retail revenue is going to get impacted into 2021. With under 10% of our tenants' employees using their space and limited retail traffic, our share of parking revenue in the second quarter was $14.2 million compared to $28 million in the comparative period in 2019. Total parking was $113 million for 2019 and $56 million for the back half of 2019. While we've seen some large sequential increases in parking in May and June, over 100% in some garages, the April base was very low and actually, LA dropped in June, given the increase in cases of COVID-19 in that market. We have not recovered many monthly parkers yet, and we don't expect to get back to 2019 monthly levels in 2020. As the population in our buildings pick up, we do expect a significant ramp up in parking as more occupants will choose to drive into Boston and Cambridge, where the bulk of our parking revenue is generated. Our apartment portfolio contributed $33 million in consolidated revenue in 2019, that's about 1.2% of total lease revenue. In-person leasing has begun in the D.C. and Boston regions, but we lost momentum in Boston as the college repopulation uncertainty has dampened demand in the market, and we have postponed the leasing at Skyline in Oakland due to the shelter-in-place orders. We're projecting only $40 million of consolidated revenue for the apartment portfolio for 2020 with an extended lease-up at the Hub50 project in Boston and Skyline projects in Oakland. All of our base building new developments have resumed, and we have been pleasantly surprised to see no productivity losses due to COVID-19 safety procedures. All the projects are on schedule for completion within our contractual obligations consistent with their pre-COVID schedules. Tenant construction is also under way across the portfolio, and we have worked through most of the potential delay issues. Here, the lack of traffic on the ground and the minimal occupancy in the buildings has actually allowed for enhanced productivity by the construction trades. We've still got no clarity on the timing of the Cambridge Marriott opening. Until Marriott Corp. has visibility on a level of occupancy that can sustain variable operating costs, we're unlikely to reopen the hotel. This is a business hotel that generates the bulk of its room nights from the Kendall Square businesses and at certain times of the year from MIT-related events. The hotel will reopen and it will once again have strong performance, but it's not going to be in the next quarter. This concludes my remarks, and let me turn it over to Mike. Mike LaBelle : Great. Thank you, Doug. Good morning. So I'm going to cover three things this morning : our second quarter performance, the credit write-offs that we recorded and some high-level perspective for the rest of 2020. Despite the pandemic, our core office portfolio that comprises 92% of our total second quarter revenue continues to perform well. As we expected and described on our last call, the weakness primarily showed up in our retail, parking and hotel performance. Our tenants in the retail industry continue to struggle with closed stores and reduced revenues. Many did not pay rent in the second quarter, though collections have improved, as Doug described in July, as stores have begun to reopen. We evaluate our tenants consistently. And this quarter, we recorded write-offs totaling $41 million at our share. This consisted of $15 million of accounts receivable and $26 million of noncash accrued rent. The vast majority of this relates to tenants in the soft goods retail and restaurant categories as well as entertainment industries that have been hit hard by the impacts of the pandemic. Going forward, we will record income from these tenants on a cash basis. The largest write-off is $14.3 million for Ann Taylor, who leases 336,000 square feet of office space for their headquarters in Times Square Tower in New York City. Times Square Tower is a building we hold in a joint venture, and our ownership interest is 55%. Ann Taylor also leases four retail stores, one in Times Square, one in Embarcadero Center and two at the Prudential Center. Ann's parent company, Ascena filed for bankruptcy last week. They've indicated a reorganization plan, primarily around the Ann Taylor and Lane Bryant brands. But it's not clear what their plans are for our stores or their headquarters space. They are currently obligated to pay us $15 million in annual rent at our share. The remaining $26.7 million of write-offs are comprised of primarily local retail, entertainment and restaurant concepts, which by definition, have more limited financial backing and where it is unclear, we will collect unpaid and accrued rent. As Doug described, we are temporarily converting some of our restaurants to a percentage rent structure and recording rent on a cash basis as most appropriate. Just $2.3 million of this remaining write-off is related to office tenants. Our second quarter FFO results of $1.52 per share reflect these charges. Excluding the write-offs, our second quarter FFO would have been $1.76 per share, which is $0.02 per share above analyst consensus for the quarter. The results came in closely aligned with the framework that we provided on last quarter's call. We expected our occupancy to come down to 92% due to expiring leases in Reston and at the GM building as well as the termination of a 125,000 square foot space in suburban Boston, where we have a replacement tenant coming in early next year. We executed our 400,000 square foot lease with Microsoft in Reston. They took possession of a portion of this space immediately, but 220,000 square feet will not be delivered until 2021. We completed over 200 lease modifications, primarily with retail tenants that resulted in abating or deferring $17 million of cash rents in the second quarter. The majority of this is recognized as straight-line rent, but the expense recovery piece can't be straight-lined and results in lower income this quarter and higher income later. Our parking revenues came in at $14 million for the quarter, that represents a decline of $11 million from the last quarter due to the loss of nearly all transient parking. Doug described this and improvement in parking is going to be dependent on increases in our building population. Our hotel, which is closed, operated at a loss of $2 million, and we have no immediate plans to reopen it. As you would expect, several of our operating statistics were meaningfully impacted this quarter in concert with our COVID-19 revenue impacts. Both our same-property results and our FAD were adversely impacted from the deferral of cash rents into later periods, the accounts receivable write-offs and the loss of parking and hotel revenues. Excluding these primarily COVID-related items, our same-property cash NOI would have grown by 3% over the second quarter 2019 and additionally, our FAD ratio would have been 83%. We have included a summary of these items in our supplemental report under a new page entitled COVID-19 Impacts. Turning to the rest of 2020. We are not providing formal guidance due to the continued uncertain environment. However, I would like to provide some high-level perspectives for the remainder of the year. For office revenues, we anticipate second half 2020 revenues to be $10 million to $15 million lower than the second quarter run rate due to the lease expirations that Doug described. We wrote off $15 million of accounts receivable this quarter, primarily for tenants and retail sector. Most of these tenants continue to be delinquent. We're completing workouts with some and others have refused to engage with us, though they remain in occupancy. We'll be recognizing revenue on a cash basis for these tenants, and we expect the second quarter run rate to continue until the retail environment improves. For our parking and hotel revenue, we expect our second quarter run rate to be a good proxy for their contribution in the third quarter. And for interest expense, we expect our quarterly run rate will be approximately $4 million higher than the second quarter due to having a full quarter of our recent $1.25 billion 10-year bond issuance. And finally, at the end of June, we sold 455,000 square feet of Capital Gallery in Washington, D.C. for $254 million. The lost FFO from the sale is approximately $4 million per quarter. As you think about our earnings outlook, it's important to remember that most of our revenues are subject to long-term lease contracts with primarily large creditworthy corporations that do not expire for many years. Our share of annualized office lease revenue, excluding the second quarter accrued rent write-off, is $2.4 billion. For the remainder of 2020, only 3% of these annualized lease revenues expire and in all of 2021, just 5.8% expire. In 2021, we will get a higher contribution from the lease-up of our residential developments and contractual rent from our 100 Causeway Street development in the latter half of the year. This provides a strong base of contractual revenue during a period of likely challenging economic conditions. Our hotel operations, our parking operations and our retail portfolio are at their nadir, and we have experienced a meaningful decline in 2020. If we are not at the bottom, we're certainly close. These business units will be coming back and when they do, the revenue will flow directly to the bottom line. We're also in a strong capital position. We have $3.4 billion of liquidity that includes $1.9 billion of cash and our full $1.5 billion line of credit available. Our cash balances are sufficient to redeem our consolidated debt maturities through early 2022 and fund our entire $1.1 billion of remaining development costs in our pipeline. Our development pipeline is 74% preleased, and it's expected to contribute significant earnings growth over the next several years. That completes our remarks. Operator, if you can open the line up for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Alexander Goldfarb : Good morning. Up there. So I guess, Mike, just the first question is, with regards to the write-offs that you guys took in the tenants that you mentioned, how many of the write-offs like how should we think about the write-offs versus tenants that are closed and like bankrupt where you have to like go and backfill the space? So you talked about Ann Taylor, you talked about this very small part of office and then you mentioned some tenants that refuse to leave their space. So as we think about you guys collecting cash rents or percent rents from tenants, the retail and restaurants, how many of that write-off bucket are still open and you expect them to slowly come back to business versus the space that's actually closed and now you guys have to go eventually recapture it and relet that? Doug Linde : Alex, this is Doug. Almost all of it is \"open,\" and those tenants are just not paying. And as you're probably aware, we don't have much that we can do other than start the legal process with regards to that. But our numbers and everything that Mike and I just talked about assumes no revenue from any of those tenants in 2020. So as we relet it or as they come to the table and start to pay, there's upside, obviously, there. But we have no sense of how long it's going to take us to move through the process. Mike LaBelle : And Alex, there's only two tenants that are bankrupt, Ann Taylor, which I spoke of, and there's also 24 Hour Fitness. So we have a 24 Hour Fitness at 601 Lexington in New York City, and that's part of the write-off. It's a couple million dollars. They are going to vacate that space. And we have a unit also in Santa Monica, and we're not clear what they're going to do with that space. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then the Under Armour space, that is still money good? Doug Linde : Under Armour is a tenant that's paying their current rent, and they're a company that raised a significant amount of capital in the last quarter. And they have a pretty significant revenue base. So we believe Under Armour is a viable, strong retailer. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then the second question is on the investment side. You guys closed on Fourth and Harrison, you announced the El Segundo JV, and you did this amid COVID. So maybe you could just walk us through how your underwriting of those two projects may have changed given that you entered them versus what you previously would have considered given everything that's going on? And Doug, your comments on the pace of the office markets and sublease that's coming on? Doug Linde : Owen, do you want to start with that one? Owen Thomas : Yes. Yes. So let me break those two apart, Alex. So Fourth and Harrison, this is a project we've been working on for many years. We have full entitlements for the first phase, which is 0.5 million feet. So we have all the Prop M. It's designed and before the pandemic occurred, we were going to proceed. So with the pandemic, we've put the project on pause to wait to see what market conditions are going to be. We had an option on the site. We think the value that we acquired the site for is attractive, whether it be a pandemic world or a nonpandemic world. And then on our additional investment in L.A., as you know, we've been talking a lot about trying to grow in LA, we've talked a lot about our perimeter, which included El Segundo. We have been looking at lots of deals there, and we've also had, frankly, a long-term conversation with Continental Development Corporation, who's our partner and the leading property company in the local market. And we were in discussions on this joint venture before the pandemic. And given our interest in going to El Segundo, given our relationship with Continental and given our confidence, as I described in my remarks of the return to the office business, we elected to proceed with that modest investment in the site on Rosecrans Avenue in El Segundo. Doug Linde : Yes. Yes. So let me break those two apart, Alex. So Fourth and Harrison, this is a project we've been working on for many years. We have full entitlements for the first phase, which is 0.5 million feet. So we have all the Prop M. It's designed and before the pandemic occurred, we were going to proceed. So with the pandemic, we've put the project on pause to wait to see what market conditions are going to be. We had an option on the site. We think the value that we acquired the site for is attractive, whether it be a pandemic world or a nonpandemic world. And then on our additional investment in L.A., as you know, we've been talking a lot about trying to grow in LA, we've talked a lot about our perimeter, which included El Segundo. We have been looking at lots of deals there, and we've also had, frankly, a long-term conversation with Continental Development Corporation, who's our partner and the leading property company in the local market. And we were in discussions on this joint venture before the pandemic. And given our interest in going to El Segundo, given our relationship with Continental and given our confidence, as I described in my remarks of the return to the office business, we elected to proceed with that modest investment in the site on Rosecrans Avenue in El Segundo. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay, thank you. Doug Linde : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Thanks, good morning. I realize this is sort of a tough question for Mike or Doug. But as you sort of you guys took a lot of sort of pain here in the second quarter here. Just sort of trying to think through what else might be out there as you kind of move forward. I know you laid out a lot of things about hotel and parking. But are there things within kind of the office? And I realize retail is smaller, but are there other sort of leases that maybe paid, but you're worried about, they paid in Q2, but they're sort of on the fence? I mean how do we just sort of think about other bad things that may occur, realizing it's still pretty dicey out there? I mean just sort of how much got flushed through this quarter? Doug Linde : Look, Steve, I think our office portfolio is in great shape. It's well occupied. It's paying. It's strong companies. I mean you've seen the portfolio of tenants that we have. And the vast majority of those tenants are not their revenues have not been significantly impacted like the retail companies are. So the vast majority of this stuff is retail. We did complete a full scrub of our tenants. We were very thoughtful about recording charges where we thought it was appropriate based upon the credit nature of the tenants and their payment history in the last four months, I guess. And that included both our office tenants and our retail tenants. So that was everybody. There are some of these tenants that we entered into rent deferral deals with, where we think it's credit good. So we're straight-lining that rent deferral, and we expect to get that rent. And we've reviewed those credits, and we felt confident about that. There's others that we said we're not so confident. So we're going to record it on a cash basis. So I can't tell you if there's going to be additional future charges or not, we don't expect there to be future charges based upon our analysis and our view. But it's really not possible to kind of fully predict what the length of this pandemic is, what the impact on the economy is. And that may result in additional challenges for some of our tenants. But at this point, we feel we've done a really strong job of looking at our whole tenant base and being really thoughtful about what we took. Steve Sakwa : Okay. And just as a quick follow-up, the $17 million, I think, that you said was abated in Q2 that you kind of believe is money good. What is the rough time table to get that $17 million payback? Doug Linde : So it varies, obviously, by tenant. I'd say, the vast majority of these tenants, we're getting back within the next 24 months. So it's 2021 and '22 kind of payback. The other thing I would add is that we did extensions with many of these tenants, and we're going to probably get in addition to getting the payback, we're going to get probably 50%-plus more because we extended the leases by three months, by six months, by sometimes a year. So we took we did take advantage of the opportunity and try to improve the overall lease terms when we were facing the situation of helping out our clients that were having some cash flow difficulties. Steve Sakwa : Okay. And then I realize you guys had about $300 million of cash sitting in escrow, some based on the sales and I think the first quarter, some based on the sales in the second quarter. Just sort of what are the thoughts to be able to successfully 1031 that money in the required time frame? Or does that maybe require a special dividend of that money? Mike LaBelle : So I do not believe it will require a special dividend of that money. And the primary reason is that, obviously, our cash flows are lower because of the loss of all the revenues we've been talking about from the hotel and the retail and the parking. So that creates room in our current dividend. With regard to reinvestment of the Capital Gallery money, which is about $250 million of the $300 million, we've got to identify something in the next, I think, 20 days or something like that. And there's nothing that we are focused on right now. So I would consider it to be a relative low likelihood that we would find something for that at this point. So that would come out and just add to our liquidity. The rest of the money that is in restricted cash is basically security deposits and stuff like that for tenants. So that doesn't have anything to do with any of the 1031s. And the 1031 money from the deals in the first quarter have already been invested in Fourth and Harrison. So there's nothing left in restricted cash for that. I don't know, Doug, if you Doug and I don't want to respond on investments at all, but no. Okay. Steve Sakwa : Great, thank you. Mike LaBelle : Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just first your comments broadly on WeWork and coworking and specifically to your exposure, kind of how do you view it today? Is there a need for any potential reserves or writedowns? Doug Linde : Owen, do you want to give... Owen Thomas : Yes. Why don't I talk a little bit about the industry, which we have mentioned before? Look, I think, clearly, given the recession and given the pandemic, which is forcing spacing, that creates a challenging environment for the coworking model, which has generally been based on selling a product per seat as opposed to per square foot. So that being said, long term, we believe in the product, because we believe the customers will want it. We think there will be retail demand from individuals, particularly given this recession and the number of people that will be out of work. We see it in our own FLEX by BXP offering. We see the interest in small customers that are interested in getting space quickly. And increasingly, we see interest from enterprise customers who want some flexibility in the procurement of a small percentage of their space. So long term, we think the product is here to stay. And the question is, who is going to be providing that and who is going to get through this pandemic most successfully? And if you look at WeWork, specifically, we have an important relationship with them. They are backed by SoftBank. They have significant capital on their balance sheet. They have new leadership. And again, you never know exactly what's going to happen, but I think and they have 50% market share, and I think they have a great opportunity if they manage well through this pandemic to be successful over the long term. Mike LaBelle : And Vikram, thanks for your question. I just we spoke on the first quarter call about our coworking exposure in total, and there was an accrued rent balance associated with coworking tenants that was roughly $30 million. So we've mentioned that in the first quarter. That still exists. We did a full analysis of WeWork, and we're comfortable with their credit based on that analysis and the liquidity and the financial support that they have. Doug Linde : And as an industry, this is Doug speaking, we have five or six different operators. We're current on almost every one of them, which obviously is good news. And as Mike said, we spent a lot of time reviewing financial statements for all of these operators. And while we're not sure what their short-term revenue prospects are at the moment, we're reasonably comfortable that we're going to continue to get paid. Vikram Malhotra : Okay. Great. And then just to maybe get a little bit more color, you talked about the impact from known move-outs in the back half of this year. But maybe just give us some color about move-outs over the next, call it, 12 or 18 months. Are there any known move-outs that you have or any larger spaces that you're focused on in terms of potential need to release? Number one. And then just secondly, from a top 10 perspective, could you clarify I think Starr Indemnity, I think, fell off of your top 20. Could you just clarify what happened there? Doug Linde : So Mike, I think, said that about 5.5% of our tenant square footage rolls over in 2021. And there are no significant tenants that are rolling out at that point. The largest one that I believe that's occurring over the next six months is a company called AECOM, that's moving out of about 250,000 square feet of space in Princeton, New Jersey, and we do not have a backfill for that. Again, that's obviously part of our numbers that we were describing in terms of our revenue for the remainder of the year. And we have some 50,000 or 60,000 square foot tenants that have a floor or two across the portfolio in Boston and across the portfolio in San Francisco that have expirations, and in many cases, we'll likely renew them. In some cases, they'll grow, in some cases, they'll shrink and in some cases, they'll not stay in the portfolio. But we're I'd say, in general, our ability to retain tenants picks up when economic conditions in the economy suffer because people are unsure of wanting to spend a lot of capital to relocate. And that obviously enures to the landlord. So typically, our recapture rate improves over time during those periods of time. Mike LaBelle : And with respect to Starr Indemnity, which is C.V. Starr, there continue to be a tenant at 399 Park, there's been no change in their lease. The only reason they moved off is that other tenants moved up. And that's primarily Microsoft. Because Microsoft took on, as I said, a portion of the space we leased to them in Reston, they took immediately because that space was available. So they moved up the list. Vikram Malhotra : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Jamie Feldman : Great, thank you. So Owen, you had mentioned interest in Seattle and working with private equity partners on the investment front. Can you talk about both of those comments? Owen Thomas : Yes. So we have been mentioning, I think, for the last year, as we think about our footprint and growth that Seattle would be a market that we would like to enter at some point provided we could find the right opportunity. A little bit like LA before Colorado Center. We wanted to go there. We were speaking with the market about that, and we waited for the right opportunity. So I would say the same thing about Seattle, and we are actively looking at things, but have chosen so far not to act on that. And then what Jamie, what was the second question? Jamie Feldman : You mentioned working through like with private equity partners and investing going forward. I just wanted to know what that might look like in... Owen Thomas : Yes. So we as you know, we have done this in the past. We have significant joint ventures with Norges, with CPP, that we've done for past acquisitions and also past capital raising. We maintain a very active dialogue in the private equity market. As you know, the private equity market is larger than the public equity market for real estate. And we are working with these partners looking at acquisitions. We want to extend our capital further. Obviously, we're not going to be we want to maintain our current leverage levels, and we're not going to be issuing equity to raise capital. So we're basically raising equity to do some of these deals on a partial basis with private partners. And the other benefit that we get from that is it does add additional yield to our capital given the fees that are involved. So I think as we continue as we as I described, pivot to offense and start to look and are looking at opportunities during the pandemic, things that are value-added existing buildings, I think it's likely we'll be doing those with private equity partners. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then in Seattle, was that life science or office that you'd be looking at? Owen Thomas : Both. Both. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then you had also mentioned, as you're talking to your tenants, maybe there's a little bit more of a shift from work from home, but or to work from home, but people generally still think office is obviously very important. Has there been any talk around how they would redesign spaces? Would people still have dedicated offices? Or would there be a little bit more sharing? I'm just curious what the latest thought processes on that? Owen Thomas : Yes. Look, right now, I think our customers are dealing with the pandemic with their existing footprints. So they're not spending significant dollars rebuilding their spaces. They're looking at what occupancy they want to accomplish in the space. Some of that is dictated by government regulation. And simply stated, I think, in open areas, they're taking out work stations, they're putting in plexiglass dividers, looking at work streams, flow streams within the space, hands-free doors whenever possible, things like that, that can be done quickly. We haven't seen yet a lot of or much of companies doing complete rebuilds in a post-COVID environment. But I do think given even though I think the pressures of the pandemic will subside over time, I do think health security is going to be increasingly on office workers' minds. And our strong expectation is that densities as a result will decrease in build-outs that we do with tenants going forward. Doug, I don't know if you've got something you'd like to add to that? Doug Linde : Yes. What I would say is that to date, we've seen nobody looking to pull a building permit to do anything in their offices. And we have a number of tenants who are obviously looking at the buildings under construction, and we have seen nothing change in the way they're configuring their space. Look, I think that they're all saying, \"We need to understand how long this is going to last? What the expectations are going to be from a governmental perspective with regards to density going forward? And what are the patterns of our workers going to be going forward? And then we can start thinking about how we might reposition our TIs.\" But the base building infrastructure and the general layout of the floors are not going to be significantly impacted where the buildings have any inability to accommodate whatever the changes might be that they choose to make. And it may very well be that it's the utilization of furniture that really solves the problems for them in terms of how they change the configuration because, obviously, most of the deals that we are doing now are with technology companies, and those technology companies generally don't have a lot of, at the moment, perimeter offices, but they do have lots of \"hollow rooms\" and conference rooms and then other collaborative areas. And again, they use furniture, in many cases, to sort of figure out how to divide and utilize those spaces. Jamie Feldman : Has the attitude changed on sharing space, though, with COVID? And like is there a movement toward less dedicated space per person or more dedicated space per person? Owen Thomas : Yes. I think definitely, right now, employees that are back at work do not want to work close to one another. There's no question about that. So clearly, in open spaces, that's where a lot of the spacing has occurred so that six feet at a minimum distancing is maintained. So that's why when we talk about the various impacts to office demand going forward, this reversal of densification, I do think is going to be important because even in a world where COVID-19 is much less prevalent than it is today, I do think health security is going to be very much on the minds of it's going to be on our minds, and it's going to be on the minds of our customers. And I do think dense layouts are going to be much less well received by employees for health safety reason. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then just a quick follow-up for Mike. So just to boil it all down, like as a percentage of total NOI, how much did you actually impair this quarter? And then how do you feel about dividend coverage going forward based on this new lower level? Mike LaBelle : Well, I think the biggest thing that affected NOI was the $15 million of accounts receivable charge-off, right, from a charge perspective because that was expected to be paid, right? Whereas the accrued rent would leak in over a long period of time. So I mean, some small percentage of that, I suppose, would have been allocated to 2020. But most of it would be spread through the life of these leases. So it's really the $15 million from the retail side that would be ongoing until these tenants either make it, then they start paying us or they don't make it, and we have to replace them. Jamie Feldman : And then dividend coverage? Mike LaBelle : As I kind of mentioned that in a previous question, I mean, I think that this provides this actually provides an opportunity for us to sell some assets in order to and enable us to have gains, which would supplement the kind of lower cash income and continue to be able to maintain our dividend where it is. At this point, we have no plans to change our dividend. In 2020, we've got some significant gains that we expect to stay gains. So at this point, I don't anticipate any change to our dividend. But obviously, that's a decision that's up to our Board that we talk about on a quarterly basis based upon outlook and what's going on in the world. So but right now, I don't think there's any impact. Operator? Jamie Feldman : All right, thank you. Operator : Yes. Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi. Michael Bilerman : Hey, it's Michael Bilerman here with Manny. Owen, at the front of the call, you talked about those four independent factors that are going to drive effective office demand and rental rates and ultimately values. And I wanted to sort of dig in on two of them. The first is being the part-time work from home versus some corporations that have made declarations of full remote, which I would agree with you, seem a lot more difficult to get all those items that you talked about in a remote environment. But even on a part-time basis, I would imagine there's some headwind from just lower square footage as companies plan for that. As you're going out and seeking to make investments, what are you baking in from that headwind? And how does that compare to the densification trend that you've had to deal with over the last more than the last decade? Have you put some numbers around it to help sort of frame what a 2- or 3- or 4-day work week different hours may mean for the amount of square footage, 100,000, 200,000 or 300,000, 400,000 square foot tenant would need? Owen Thomas : Yes. So Michael, so the just to start with the part-time aspect and what impact that could have on space demand, when you say that's going to be a headwind to space demand, which it could be, you also are assuming that the employees are going to : one, schedule when they're going to be out of the office; and two, be prepared to be in a flexible workspace. Otherwise, there's no savings. And I'm not suggesting that all our customers or some of our customers won't do that, they probably will. But that is an additional challenge. I do think a lot of the types of workers that we have in our buildings when they think about work from home, I think they feel that they want to do that on their schedule and when they come to the office that they have a workstation. And if that's your configuration, there's no savings on space. Now to go to the second part of your question, which is to how to quantify all this? Look, I think it's difficult. I mean that's why I mentioned that there are these four factors out there. I actually think the most important factor right now in the short term is the recession. That's what's driving most of the challenges that we're seeing in the office market conditions, it's the recessionary effects. So any acquisition that we are going to be and we are that we are currently or will look at, we're going to be very conservative on where market rents are and what their growth prospects are. And it's not just driven by this balance that you suggest between work from home and densification, it's driven by the whole menu that I described. And most importantly, I think, recessionary effects in the short term. Michael Bilerman : Right. And this is a good way to sort of break it up between the different factors and drivers. The second one, you talked about the location aspect. And clearly, there's been a big boon in suburban home buying. And typically, as I think about office markets, you are going for talent, and they're also driven by where decision-makers want to live, right? So you think about the West LA market, why is it so hot while everyone lives there that wants to have a short commute to their office. So I guess, why shouldn't the market be more concerned with people very wealthy people moving out of New York down to Florida and then a younger generation that's making a decision to flee urban markets to go suburban? Won't that ultimately lead to businesses than going to chase those same employees or the decision-makers saying, \"I want to have all my people here, right?\" You look at barrister moving down to Florida and say, \"I'm going to create my office down in Florida versus having a large-scale presence in Connecticut?\" Owen Thomas : Yes. Michael, I think it's a challenging question just to answer definitively because every business has different characteristics, different ownership, different dynamics that are going on. I think the evidence what we can go on is the evidence that we see. And the evidence that we see, particularly, say, for example, here in the New York area, is the commutable residential locations are have very strong market conditions because with COVID-19 being an accelerant, individuals, young families who were maybe considering leaving the city, they're saying, \"Okay, this is now maybe the time to do it.\" But I do think a lot of these locations are commutable and I think that we're not seeing a lot of companies saying, \"We're going to move to Westchester, to New Jersey to chase this talent pool.\" I think the talent pool is looking at locations where they're going to be able to commute back into New York and go to work. So that's what we see right now. Michael Bilerman : Okay, that's helpful color. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Derek Johnston : Hi, everyone. Thank you. How is the glut of sublease space being offered in San Fran currently affecting market dynamics from your on the ground vantage? And I guess second to that is, is San Francisco is still the strongest market nationally? Doug Linde : So this is Doug. So the answer is, it's not affecting the market yet because there's nobody out in the market looking for space. It will affect the market and rents will be lower. The fact is that San Francisco is not the strongest market that we have in our portfolio right now. The greater Boston market is a stronger relative market than San Francisco given what has happened from an employment perspective in San Francisco relative to the Massachusetts market, obviously, given the extensive life science community that is here and the ancillary businesses that surround it. There's just there's more stability right now in the greater Boston market than there is in San Francisco. Derek Johnston : Okay, great. And what regions are being considered for expansion? Or when you do finally go on offense, you did mention LA and Seattle. Are there any up and coming secondary markets or which other metros look interesting to the team several quarters down the road from today's? Owen Thomas : Our footprint today, we are very significantly sized in four major urban areas in the U.S., and we have a growing deployment in LA, and we just took another step, albeit modest step, this quarter to increase the scale of our LA operations. I mentioned earlier in my remarks, and I answered one of the other questions about an ambition for Seattle. And you should consider that to be our footprint. We are not looking at other cities at this time. We are seeing plenty of and I think we'll see, over time, significant opportunities, not only in the two markets where we're trying to grow, LA and Seattle, but also in the four markets where we currently exist, given our relationships and access to deal flow and all those types of things. I would also mention in terms of investments going forward. We also, in addition to investing in the existing development pipeline we have, in all of our four major markets, we also have a significant land portfolio that we control and are always entitling, and that will be part of our investment growth once the pandemic is over as well. Operator? Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico. Nick Yulico : Thank you. I just wanted to ask about the rent abatements and deferrals. You broke out that number, which was helpful, just over $16 million impact in the quarter. A couple of questions on that. First, how much of that was related to retail versus office? And then is it possible to get the deferral piece? And then particularly, I'm just I'm interested in how also you came up with the decision to include that deferral as a negative to your same store, which seems conservative versus how other companies are reporting it since presumably, you do expect to get some of that money back? Mike LaBelle : So this is Mike. So the to answer your last question first, I guess, it's really an accounting judgment. And the NAREIT worked with FASB to give people kind of a shortcut to be able to put deferrals up on accounts receivable instead of straight-lining them like we would in normal lease modification, provided that deferral did not result in a change a material change in the overall amount of rent that was being paid by that tenant. So basically, if you're just saying somebody, you don't have to pay for the next three months, but you pay double rent for the three months after that, there's no change in the lease. And companies could do that and just put the three months on accounts receivable, the cash income, and then when it gets paid, relieve the receivable. The vast majority of the stuff that we did, we had lease extensions that we wanted to get out of these things. So we made the election that we're just going to treat these all like lease modifications. And so we basically straight-lined every single one of them. We took the reduction in our cash same-store for the deferral period, and we're going to have higher cash same-store later because of these deals. That's how we decided to do it. We thought that was the most appropriate way. With respect to the breakdown, I mean, there was a few office tenants. The vast majority of number of these tenants were retail tenants. And most of it was deferral. Only 20% or 25% of this was kind of an abatement in total, and the majority of it is deferral. There is some additional deferral that will come later in the year because some of these were longer than a three deferral. So right now, I would expect another next quarter to have a similar it's a little bit less, but somewhat similar deferral that we have this quarter. And we it's possible we could do additional activity. We talked about the restaurants and doing percentage rent with those tenants for a further period of time. So that's kind of where we are with that. And again, most of this gets paid back over the next couple of years. And we did extensions with most of these tenants. So the overall rent that we're going to be getting over the terms of these leases is significantly higher than just getting the rent deferral back. And that was a big part of what we wanted to do to, again, just secure the longer-term lease, so we don't have to deal with downtime or transaction costs in the future. Nick Yulico : Okay. That's helpful. Second question is just going back to what, I guess, feels like a bit of a stalemate right now in the office rental market. I think, Doug and Owen, you talked about not really seeing much in terms of price discovery on new leases and because tenants are really not looking to do a lot of leasing unless there's near-term expirations. When does that end? And I guess I'm wondering, at the same time, are you not yet adjusting asking rates, adjusting concession terms? Are competitors also not doing that and yet because there's no need to? And if you have any gut feel for at what point you start to see a return to new leasing? Is it in the fall when more employees are back in the office? Is it a 2021 issue? Recognize it's hard to predict, but any color that would be appreciated. Doug Linde : Let me start and then Owen can add on. I would say that the health solution to what is going on with the virus is going to be the most critical component to when people start to get back to \"ordinary transactional activity.\" I mean there's obviously lots of leases that expire every year. And right now, no one is doing anything. And as people become more confident in the health solution, they will be in a position where they can start to make decisions and actually do the kinds of things that they would normally do, which is actually go out into our spaces, higher architects to do space planning, start to gain proposals, and then ultimately, you'll start to see transaction volume occurring. My own view is that depending upon the area, that will happen in the latter parts of 2020 at the very earliest. So I don't see the third quarter being terribly active from a transactional perspective. And obviously, transactions take time to germinate and then get consummated. So there's just a cycle associated with that that's going to be important to just actually have to occur from a timing perspective. The new development economics, I think, will potentially see some additive transactions because those are much longer lead term items. And so if you're looking for a new building or a new facility or a growth alternative and you're looking at getting two or three years in front of that, those transactions, I think, will have less impact from an economic perspective, again, because people are going to have to put capital to work as opposed to existing assets where you've got to take what the market is going to give you. Owen? Owen Thomas : Yes. No, Doug, I think you covered it. I would just add, again, it's to me, it's all about the virus because it's and I think businesses, business leaders are going to be reticent to make financial commitments until they have some feel for the course of the virus. We've already had, I guess, a first spike in certain areas of the country, but certainly a second spike across the whole U.S. The vaccine looks like there's good progress that's being made, but there's nothing definitive yet. And so I just don't see activity returning until there's a business leader has some better definition around when the recovery can happen more in earnest. Nick Yulico : And so right now, you or your competitors, you're not really finding need to adjust asking rents or adjust concessions being offered? Doug Linde : There are relatively few active requirements of tenants that are looking for new space that are different than, \"Hey, can you give us a six month extension? Can you give us a one year extension? Can we extend our lease by 15 months?\" I mean that's what we're dealing with, not with tenant that's out in the market, wants to move, is thinking about reconfiguring their space and they are soliciting proposals for a relocation, right? I mean it's just those are few and far between. And so without having activity, it's hard to reset pricing because there's no pricing to reset, too. Nick Yulico : Okay, appreciate it. Thanks everyone. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Frank Lee with BMO. Frank Lee : Hi, Owen, You mentioned census is at 8% in your office buildings. I just want to clarify if this was just suburban assets or across your portfolio? And where do you think this could potentially go in September and then heading into 2021? Owen Thomas : I'm sorry... Doug Linde : Yes. So we have pretty good data for all of our CBD buildings in Boston, all of our CBD buildings in New York City and a portion of our CB deal billings in San Francisco. And on any given day, those buildings are running under 10%. And in many days, they're running 6% to 8%. And similarly with the suburban locations. As I said to you before, I think that the business leaders in our portfolio are heating the and respecting the desire of the governmental authorities to ask people to work from home wherever possible. And that is going to continue until there is a more sustainable reduction in the spread rate across the economy. And as we look into the fall, I don't think September is going to bring a meaningful change. Could the number go up from 8% to 10% at 10% to 15%? Sure. But it's not going to be at a level that is going to make us feel like that everyone is back to work until, as Owen said, the virus has shown some degree of maintenance from a vaccine and a therapeutics perspective. Owen Thomas : Yes. Be aware, if you go around our portfolio, there's regulation on this as well. Boston and New York are at 50%, D.C. area is at 25% and California and New Jersey are closed. So there's also those caps as well. I think you'll have a tick up. My guess is you'll have a little bit of a tick up after the summer after Labor Day. I do hear that. But I agree with Doug. I don't think it's going to go back to \"anything close to normal,\" but I think it will get above certainly where we are right now. Frank Lee : Okay. And then going back to the one million square feet of expected known move outs, do you have a sense how this figure has changed over the past couple of months? Doug Linde : Yes, the so the number was 1.5 million square feet, and there's about 500,000 square feet of space that we believe is going to stay. So the number has declined. And the ones that we know about are have been known for a long time, meaning a number of months, if not years. Frank Lee : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Ismail with Green Street Advisor. Daniel Ismail : Great, thank you.Owen, you referenced this briefly in your opening remarks, but given where the cost of debt is and with hedging costs moving lower, could we see cap rates for stabilized CBD office properties move lower once transactions resume? Owen Thomas : I let's when you say lower, I'm going to assume you're talking about prepandemic levels. I think that you have to look to answer the question, I think you have to think about the characteristics of the building. So I think if you've got a building in an innovation market that has very little lease rollover to a credit to A or several credit tenants, I think those kinds of buildings' cap rates will definitely hold and they could go down. I think buildings that have more lease rollover, that's where cap rates are probably not going to go down and probably are going to go up because there's more uncertainty about dealing with that rollover. What is the market rent? What's if there's a move out, what's the time for the releasing of that space given some of the market uncertainties that we've described on this call? So I think the answer to your question lies in what's the characteristics of the building. Daniel Ismail : And then as you think about expanding more toward the life science sector, are there any targets in mind for what that could reach as a proportion of your total portfolio? And what are the pros and cons you see into expanding more into life science versus traditional office? Owen Thomas : Yes. Well, the our strategy is always to be in the best cities, have the best locations and try to have the best properties and to serve the customers that are the most active at the time that want to be in those locations and in those buildings. And today, as we've been talking about, life science as well as tech is a very strong has a very strong demands for new office space. So and the good news is, as I described in my remarks, we already have a foothold in this business, given the buildings that we have, the biopharma tenants that we have in the development portfolio that we have that we think we can execute upon in the years ahead. I gave the figure of five million square feet of potential development. Again, that's over a longer period of time. The company today is over 50 million square feet, if that gives you some magnitude toward the question that you asked. Daniel Ismail : And finally, just a housekeeping question. Going back to the top tenant's list, it looks like Leidos also fell off the top 20 tenants. I'm just curious if there's anything happening with respect to abatements or deferrals that are impacting that top 20 tenant list. Mike LaBelle : No. Leidos was they basically were in two buildings at once because they moved into their new building right at the end of the quarter, and they were still in their old building, and now they're out of the old building and they're only in the new building. That's in Reston Town Center, where we relocated them and expanded them. So that was it had all to do about that transition and nothing to do with any changes in lease term. Daniel Ismail : Okay, great, thank you everyone Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Blaine Heck : Great, thanks. Just a quick one on Fourth and Harrison. You talked about that project being on pause for now. I know it's a pretty difficult environment now, and you're going to be dealing with pressure on rents from the increase in sublease space in that market. But I guess, ultimately, what are the major metrics, signals or hurdles that you guys are looking for to maybe get more confident in your ability to start that project and ultimately achieve the returns that you guys deem acceptable? Owen Thomas : Well, I think the key will be the tenant activity. I mean we're actively attempting to speak with customers to prelease all or a portion of that building now. So those I would not say that describe those conversations, it's robust, given the environment that we've described on this call. But it will be driven by the demand that we see in the marketplace. And then, of course, given the Doug might want to talk about this given recessionary effects on construction costs that could be a benefit to our economics of the project. Blaine Heck : Yes. Just on that, can you quantify kind of what you're seeing as far as the movement in construction costs? How much it's come down, if so, relative to prepandemic levels? Doug Linde : We're we can't we have not bid anything on a base building basis of significance in the last, call it, three months. On the larger capex projects that we're doing across the company, we're seeing reductions of a minimum of 5% and sometimes more. As the pipeline for future business starts to get shallower for the construction industry, we believe that there will be competitive pressures, not unlike what we're going to see with regards to rental rates. That are going to drive the contractors and the subcontractors to be more hungry for business and, therefore, lower their margins and put us in a position where we're seeing reductions in the rate of escalations as opposed to increases on an annual basis. So we won't know for until we actually did something. And we have right now, nothing is sort of in the pipeline to be bid. Blaine Heck : Thanks Guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Mizuho. Tayo Okusanya : Yes, good morning. I hopefully, I didn't miss it, but was there any comments on coworking in general and then WeWork around dot-com region? Owen Thomas : We did get asked that earlier. I'll summarize again quickly. We acknowledge that the current environment is a challenge for coworking, given that we have a recession and given that physical separation requirements are difficult for a business that you're trying to sell by the seat versus the square foot. That being said, we have confidence in the coworking model over the long-term because we think it will continue to be attractive to various customer bases, including individuals, small business and larger enterprises. The existing coworking operators are clearly going through a challenging period given the pandemic. But as we specifically look to WeWork, they have a 50% market share. They have several billion dollars on their balance sheet, they have new leadership, and they have the banking of SoftBank. We have a strong relationship with them, and we think they have a great chance of being successful over the long-term in that business. Tayo Okusanya : So at this point, they're not giving back space or do you mean anything of that nature? Owen Thomas : No. Tayo Okusanya : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it over to the speakers for final remarks. Owen Thomas : Okay. I think that concludes all of our remarks. I'd like to thank everyone for their attention this afternoon. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks. Owen Thomas : Thank you, Sara, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m joining you today from BXP\u2019s New York office, where I\u2019ve been working since New York opened in June and have more recently been commuting on public transit. New York City is slowly coming back to life with more open shops and restaurants, and our building census is over 15% and rising each week. All of our markets and BXP offices with the exception of those in New Jersey and Los Angeles are opened at bearing capacity limits set by local guidelines. Despite a challenging recessionary environment, BXP continued to perform well in the third quarter, demonstrating the durability of our business. In the quarter, we collected 99% of our office rents and 97% of rents overall. We completed 811,000 square feet of leasing, 40%being either new requirements or expanding existing customers, and we increased our average net rental rates on our second generation leases by 20%. We entered into an option agreement to joint venture CityPoint South, a large scale multi-phase development site in Waltham, Massachusetts, that can accommodate both office and life science demand. And we completed the previously described acquisition of a 50% interest in the Beach Cities Media Center site in El Segundo. And since quarter end, we signed a 200,000 square foot 20-year lease with Volkswagen Group of America for their U.S. headquarters at our Reston Next development in Reston, Virginia. With the VW lease and previously secured anchor tenant, Fannie Mae, this 1.1 million square footprint property is now 85% pre-leased.  I am proud of our team at BXP\u2019s resilience and fortitude in both assisting our customers and safely returning to work and delivering results for shareholders in a challenging time. Well over 50% of our employees are opting to work in the office subject to local occupancy restrictions. Now moving to the economy. The course of the U.S. and global economic recoveries remain heavily impacted by the course of the pandemic. New COVID-19 cases are hitting record highs in the U.S. Fortunately for BXP, new cases per unit of population in the states where we operate remain at levels below the national average. While we anticipate a vaccine will likely become available by year-end, it is unlikely to be a magic bullet that immediately eliminates the pandemic given broad deployment will face issues around manufacturing, distribution, uptake and efficacy. Though difficult to assess, we think economic conditions for the first half of 2021 will remain sluggish, but expect a more pronounced reopening of the economy and return to the office in the second half of 2021 due to distribution of a vaccine, better therapeutics and more individual adoption of health safety protocols as we all learn how to combat and live with COVID-19. With many office workers still working remotely, there continues to be much speculation, not surprisingly, about the future of work and use of office space. To understand the current market environment and contemplate future demand, I will revisit the 4 key drivers of office demand I discussed last quarter, namely employment, location, density and occupancy or better known as work from home. Job losses and the slowdown in economic activity due to the pandemic have been and will be the most important drivers of office market conditions for the foreseeable future. Recovery has commenced with almost 4 million jobs created in the third quarter, and unemployment has dropped to 7.9%, which is 6.8 percentage points below the peak in April, but 4.4 percentage points above the low in February. We are confident of economic recovery and believe our properties and markets will perform well over time given their proximity to resilient and growing tech and life science demand. Regarding location, there continues to be speculation about companies moving from major urban environments to secondary markets or suburban locations. To-date, we have seen no evidence of pandemic-driven movement among our customer base to secondary cities or suburban locations. On densification, it is clear that the pandemic has reversed the trend of increasingly dense work environments as companies are spreading out their employees for health security purposes. Doug, in his remarks, will provide case studies in BXP\u2019s portfolio. With many companies not back in their offices, it is impossible to quantify this trend today. But we believe the reversal of densification will be a material tailwind for office demand over the longer term. Finally, on work from home. We remain convinced that successful companies will work in person. It is increasingly clear to our customers and other business leaders that there are significant gaps in conducting business on a fully remote basis in terms of creating and maintaining culture, creativity and productivity as well as on-boarding, training and development. Again, Doug will provide several examples among our customers.  Following the pandemic, work from home will become more accepted, likely as a benefit offered to employees. However, space savings cannot be achieved unless employees schedule their work from home days and utilize floating workstations when in the office, which could be more difficult with the type of workforce employed in our premium assets. Now moving to private equity market conditions for office assets, transaction volumes are down 60% for the third quarter versus last year and 42% year-to-date. Buildings in tech heavy markets with long weighted average lease term are selling for pre-COVID cap rates. And life science-related assets are also in strong demand. However, there is limited activity for assets with lease-up and/or rollover risk due to bid-ask spread and pricing. Buyers want a discount for lower rents and slower lease-up and sellers believe in a full market recovery and can inexpensively hold on by refinancing. Some of the fewer deals completed in the third quarter of note are, Genesis Towers in South San Francisco sold for $1 billion, nearly $1,300 a square foot and a 4.75% cap rate. This 780,000 square foot 2-tower complex is 96% leased, built for life science use and it\u2019s sold to a healthcare REIT. This deal illustrates the high level of liquidity available for life science related assets. Reservoir Woods East in Waltham sold for $330 million to a REIT. The property is comprised of a 313,000 square foot leased office building, a 202,000 square foot soon-to-be-vacated office building that will likely be converted to lab use and land with development potential of approximately 440,000 square feet. Assuming a land price of $80 per developable square foot, the buildings, one of which is essentially vacant, would be valued at $575 a square foot. In Santa Monica, 2041 Colorado is under agreement to sell for $166 million, which is $780 a square foot and a 4.3% cap rate. This recently repositioned 93,000 square foot property is 100% leased with a long weighted average lease term and is being sold to a domestic life insurance company. In Reston, Patriots Park was sold for $325 million or about $450 a square foot and a 5.6% cap rate. This 724,000 square foot asset is fully leased and sold to an asset management company. BXP built and subsequently sold Patriots Park in 2014 at roughly the same valuation. In the Bellevue, Washington Spring District, 2 new buildings comprising 540,000 square feet long-term lease to Facebook are under agreement to sell for $565 million to a fund manager. Pricing is approximately a 4.5% cap rate and $1,050 a square foot. Moving to BXP capital activities. Last quarter, I described a relative dearth of new investment deal flow due to the early phases of the pandemic and low refinancing costs. This past quarter, we\u2019ve experienced a modest uptick in new acquisition opportunities and expect our pipeline to grow into 2021. Though nothing is imminent, we are actively looking at new investments with private equity joint venture partners. We did complete an option agreement to become a 50% joint venture partner with a local developer in CityPoint South, which is a 42-acre site supporting 1.2 million square feet in Waltham proximate to our CityPoint asset. The deal structure includes a favorable fixed land price with the option to close on individual sites in a phased manner based on market conditions and our ability to secure prelease commitments. As part of this development, we will be completing new interchange improvements onto the I95 Route 128 enhancing access to our entire Waltham portfolio. Waltham, already a mature life science market, has recently seen a significant increase in leasing interest from life science tenants and this site allows for the development of both office and lab properties. This investment provides a significant boost to our growing life science business and will create more life science critical mass for the opportunities we have already identified for potential lab development and redevelopment in Waltham. We also continue to invest in our development pipeline, which currently stands at 8 development and redevelopment projects comprising 4.3 million square feet and $2.4 billion in total investment. The commercial component of this portfolio is now close to 80% preleased, with aggregate projected cash yields at stabilization of approximately 7%. Our development pipeline is an underappreciated asset of BXP that we expect will add approximately $200 million to our NOI by the end of 2024. This quarter, we placed into service 2 residential projects, Hub50House, the 440-unit residential component of our Hub on Causeway mixed-use development in Boston. And the Skyline, a 402-unit multifamily asset located at the MacArthur Transit Station in Oakland. Both assets are heavily amenitized and of the highest relative quality in their local markets. Initial lease-up has been slow given the operating environment, but both assets will provide BXP NOI growth in future quarters. And a final word about the investment opportunity in BXP shares. Our office portfolio continues to demonstrate resilience with an outstanding base of creditworthy tenants across sectors. With the future delivery of our leased development pipeline and recovery potential in our parking, hotel and retail portfolios, we have a solid growth story. From the peak in early 2020, our FFO per share is down 14%, but our share price is down 50%. Our dividend yield has gone from 2.7% to 5.3%. At BXP\u2019s current share price, our underlying asset cap rate is around 7% and private market cap rates, as I described earlier, are materially lower. Clearly, at our current stock price, we think the value story is obvious and glaring. To conclude, 2020 continues to be a challenging time for many types of real estate, including office, as the pandemic continues to take its toll on the economy. However, all pandemics and recessions eventually come to an end, and we are confident in BXP\u2019s market position with long lease terms, minimal near-term lease rollover and strong liquidity to invest opportunistically. BXP has the franchise, capital and business strategy to emerge from the pandemic and recession with strength and momentum.  So let me turn it over to Doug. Doug Linde : Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. I think I might have misheard what Owen said when he was talking about one of the asset sales. The building in -- near Colorado Center in LA was $1,700 a square foot, not $700 a square foot. So if I misheard that, I apologize. My comments this morning are going to focus on our office and our life science leasing activity. But first, a couple of remarks on our ongoing operations. So as Owen said, government and public health leaders continue to encourage businesses to work from home. And with very few exceptions, business leaders have not required their employees to return to the office. Massachusetts was the first of our markets to pull back restrictions. And while office occupants are allowed to be at 50%, our urban census has been pretty steady at about 9% for the last few months. Our suburban Boston portfolio includes about 5 million square feet and 33 single-story to 6-story buildings. Virtually every tenant employee drives their own car to work. The census is here is about 5%. In Northern Virginia, the second market that relaxed restrictions, companies are actually required just to social distance and there are no limits to the occupancy threshold, and employees drive to their office. We estimate our census is well under 15%. At this time, the return to work is not about transportation constraints, and it\u2019s not about elevator constraints either. Our New York City towers have the highest census at about 16% daily and more than 23% of the people who have badges in our CBD New York City buildings are going to work at least once a week. While a number of our retail tenants have reopened with volume restrictions, traffic is subdued and many food service and other amenities still remain closed. While there is some urban retail street activity, we suspect it is more from local walkable residents and not from people coming to work every day. Monthly parking passes have not yet begun to rebound and transient parking continues to be pretty light. If people are not coming to the office, then they\u2019re not paying for monthly parking, and they\u2019re not shopping or dining in the areas close by our buildings. We opened our Cambridge Hotel in October, and it\u2019s running under 10% occupancy, and we are simply trying to cover incremental operating expenses and put people back to work. Room sales are predominantly leisure guests, not business travelers, and there are no food and beverage operations being offered at the property. As you\u2019ve heard or read from a lots of brokerage reports, market leasing activity is very light. In the context of the comments that Owen and I just made and the continued uncertainty regarding the public health issues, this should be expected. What I hope will be very encouraging for everybody on this call, investors and analysts here, is the level of Boston Properties activity right now. This is what really matters for our performance. In previous down cycles, our portfolio and our operating team have outperformed the market, and we believe this is happening again. I\u2019m going to start with our Boston area operations. This quarter, we completed a post-COVID lease with Columbia Threadneedle Investments for 83,000 square feet at our Atlantic Wharf property on space it is currently leased and does not set to expire until the end of 2021. While Colombia had targeted Atlantic Wharf as a great option, we were actually not originally considered since we didn\u2019t have available space that can meet their occupancy window. We were able to structure an early termination of an existing tenant who is expiring to accommodate the new tenant\u2019s timing, and we quickly completed a 13-year lease. The cash rent on this lease will be 30% higher than the expiring rent fully grossed up, and there are future rent increases. This is important because even though the markets are seeing higher availability, and rents and concessions may change, our leases continue to have significant embedded growth, particularly in our Boston and our San Francisco portfolios. In suburban Boston, our life science activities continue to accelerate. We are close to completing a lease with a single-tenant for the entirety of our life science conversion at 200 West Street, a 138,000 square feet. We\u2019ve actually grown the building. To preempt the question, we have spent about $140 a square foot upgrading the base building for lab use. And if you amortize a portion of the lab TI against the lab rent, we will achieve an incremental return on cost of about 10%. The base building is just being completed, and this tenant will be in occupancy in mid-2021. We are in the final stages of completing a full building as is extension with an early stage life science company at 100 Hayden Avenue, 56,000 square feet, which will kick-in when our direct lease with Shire Pharmaceuticals expires in mid-2021. This one only has a 40% increase in rent. We also have an LOI with a healthcare company for the entirety of our 63,000 square-foot building at 195 West Street in Waltham. As Owen said, we have a 1.2 million square feet joint venture at CityPoint, and we\u2019ve also put our plans together to develop 180 CityPoint, 310,000 square feet as a life science building. We\u2019re also studying the conversion of some of our Winter Street office assets in Waltham to life science and are pursuing permits for additional life science or office buildings on existing land holdings in Waltham and Lexington. Finally, in Waltham, we are close to completing a 75,000 square-foot lease with a technology company that will bring 20 CityPoint\u2019s office space to 100% leased. That was a building that was put in service earlier this year. Turning to Northern Virginia. This quarter, we completed 2 additional leases with Microsoft to expand and extend their premises in Reston Town Center. They leased an additional 45,000 square feet and extended the 2028 expiration on 164,000 square feet to 2033. We\u2019ve also completed another 96,000 square foot of leases, 8 transactions during the quarter there. We are in negotiation on 5 more leases, totaling 65,000 square feet, for vacant space in the Town Center. As Owen said, we signed our 20-year lease with VW at Reston Next. And while we had to contract Fannie Mae\u2019s premises in order to accommodate VW, we\u2019re now 85% leased, and both of the tenants have rights for short-term growth. Just as an aside, if you look at our development properties and include the leasing at 200 West Street, the office portfolio lease percentage will be 80%, and this includes Dock 72 at its current leasing of 33%. Moving to New York. In New York, on July 1, we completed a110,000 square foot 15-month extension at the General Motors building with a tenant that had an early 2022 expiration. The tenant was negotiating for a relocation and COVID-19 resulted in a reevaluation of that decision. The General Motors building is our most active single asset in the entire company. Since June 1st, we\u2019ve had 15 unique in-person tenant tours for tenants ranging from 3,000 square feet to 40,000 square feet, and we\u2019ve converted 2 to leases. For comparison purposes, we had about 20 tours in our entire Boston CBD portfolio and 16 at Embarcadero Center since June 1. We\u2019ve made some progress with Ascena/Ann Taylor at Times Square Tower. We expect them to continue to lease about 150,000 square feet of office and retail space, with cash rent commencing in January of 2021. We completed a 1-year extension for a 70,000 square foot tenant at 510 Madison, bringing their expiration into early 2023. And we\u2019ve done 4 small tenant transactions at 250 West 55th Street, totaling 17,000 square feet. Two weeks ago, we completed a full floor post-COVID lease renewal at 601 Lexington Avenue for 30,000 square feet. In Princeton, we\u2019ve seen absolutely no New York City outmigration tenant inquiry. But we\u2019ve completed 5 transactions, including 2 expansions for about 40,000 square feet, and we have an aggregate of about 100,000 square feet of active conversations at Carnegie Center. Our California properties have been subject to essential worker-only restrictions until yesterday in San Francisco. In Santa Monica, we continue our renewal negotiations with our 2020 and \u201821 expirations. In the Silicon Valley, we\u2019ve signed an LOI for 68,000 square feet with a life science tenant to utilize available office space at 601 Gateway in South San Francisco beginning in the fourth quarter of \u201821. Our Gateway JV is planning the conversion of 651 Gateway, which is a 293,000 square foot office building to lab, and we hope to start that construction in late 2021. We are finalizing lease with a 31,000 square foot life science tenant in our North First buildings down in San Jose, and we\u2019ve also seen life science tenant interest for our Mountain View Research Properties that are single-story structures that in the past have had both wet benches and clean rooms. Activity at our San Francisco CBD assets, where we\u2019re just under 96% leased and have 415,000 square feet of tenants expiring in the remainder of \u201820 and \u201821 has been greatly impacted by the governmental restrictions, as I said, which were listed yesterday on a partial basis. The third quarter only produced 3 transactions totaling about 23,000 square feet at Embarcadero Center. However, we have 114,000 square feet of new near-term expirations that we have gotten contractual commitments on renewals that have been exercised, and they are simply subject to a rent reset. The expiring rent on that 114,000 square feet is $61 a square foot fully escalated gross. I want to end with a brief comment on space utilization. Since we\u2019ve seen a number of REIT analysts make some assumptions about reductions of office space utilization going forward, largely due to work from home. I\u2019m not going to give you our opinion. Rather, I\u2019m going to provide a series of decisions that our customers are making in our Boston market post-COVID. First, one of our large tenants in Cambridge had a contractual right to give back 190,000 square feet of office space in July. The right expired unused. Second, one of our large hundreds of thousands of square feet tenants in Boston has completed a space planning process as part of a total reconfiguration of their premises, that takes into consideration COVID planning considerations and their seat count in that premises is down 30% from pre-COVID, 30%. Third, Columbia Threadneedle was downsizing from 156,000 square feet pre-COVID. They signed a 13-year lease for 83,000 square feet, which was in line with their original search requirement. Fourth, we are trying to find space in our Back Bay portfolio for a 75,000 square foot private equity firm, and we are actively asking tenants if they would consider early terminations. This tenant is currently leasing 60,000 square feet. Fifth, we\u2019re managing the build-out of a large multi-floor installation for a technology tenant in 1 of our new buildings. We continue to move forward with the space build out on the entire premises as planned. Sixth, we have a 70,000 square foot technology antenna in Waltham with a 2031 expiration. We\u2019ve made a proposal for them to relocate into 100,000 square feet in June, with an expectation that they\u2019ll take another 100,000 square feet over the next few years. Finally, to show I\u2019m not -- I am being objective, we have a 77,000 square foot consulting firm as a tenant in the CBD portfolio with the June 1, 2021 expiration. This entity is part of a large corporate merger that was announced in late 2019. Pre COVID, we were discussing a 2-year extension. Today, we\u2019re having no discussions, and it\u2019s unclear if they will do anything prior to their lease expiration. Despite being in the midst of this COVID-induced recession and the corresponding slow repopulation, we continue to have leasing activity and tenants continue to make long-term space commitments. In previous down cycles, as I said before, our portfolio has outperformed, and this will happen again.  This concludes my remarks. Mike? Mike LaBelle : Great. Thank you, Doug. Hello, everybody. Good morning. I\u2019m going to cover the details of our earnings for the quarter, and I\u2019ll also provide some insight into our expectations for the fourth quarter and some comments on how we are thinking about 2021. For the quarter, we reported FFO for the third quarter of $1.57 per share. Our earnings were in line with consensus estimates if you exclude the $0.06 per share of charges for the write-down of $6 million of non-cash accrued rent and $4 million of accounts receivable. The $10 million of tenant write-offs this quarter were substantially less than last quarter. And once again, they were focused in our retail clients. In particular, our theaters and health clubs are not demonstrating the ability to pay rent consistently, and we\u2019ve elected to write-off unpaid rent and recognize all rent going forward from these 2 categories on a cash basis. Our office portfolio remains strong, and we continue to see no meaningful credit weakness among our office tenants. As a reminder, the office portfolio comprises over 92% of our current revenue and collections continue to be strong at 99% of our third quarter billings. Similar to last quarter, we have provided a page in our supplemental financial package that describes all the COVID-related impacts to our portfolio. Occupancy this quarter did decline by 90 basis points as we expected, primarily from a known tenant move out of 234,000 square feet in Princeton and 100,000 square feet of transitionary vacancy between tenants in Reston Town Center. We\u2019ve already signed leases for this space in Reston, and we expect it to be occupied in 2021. We partially offset the impact of the occupancy decline with revenue growth from a full quarter of contribution from our 100% leased 1750 Presidents Way development in Reston that we delivered in the second quarter, and $2 million of growth in our parking revenues. Parking revenues grew by 15% from last quarter. And while this is on a small base, it is a good sign of increases on our building census and mobility in our cities relative to the second quarter. I want to start my discussion of our expectations for the fourth quarter and 2021 with comments on our leasing exposure for the rest of the year. We report 1.6 million square feet of leases expiring in the fourth quarter. We are actively working on renewals for over 525,000 square feet, and we currently have approximately 400,000 square feet of space that we anticipate will be vacating. In addition, we have 675,000 square feet in this grouping of the tenants whose leases we have terminated, but they have not yet vacated their space. So they\u2019re still in occupancy. We expect that these tenants will remain in place until a resolution is reached. We have not been recognizing revenue from these tenants in Q2, Q3 or Q4. So there\u2019s really no financial impact until we either negotiate a lease amendment, such as within Ann Taylor, or we get the space back and obtain a replacement tenant. We expect our year-end same-property occupancy to be between 90% and 90.5%. We also will be adding Dock 72 to the in-service portfolio next quarter, which will negatively impact the headline occupancy rate, but have no impact on our NOI run rate. We expect these changes in occupancy will result in a portfolio NOI run rate for the fourth quarter that will be relatively flat to the third quarter, inclusive of the $6 million of accrued rent write-offs. This assumes we have no new charges in the fourth quarter. Looking ahead to 2021,we have 580,000 square feet of signed leases in our same-property portfolio that are not currently in our run rate. We expect that these tenants will commence occupancy and revenue recognition in the first quarter of 2021. This includes 170,000 square feet at 399 Park Avenue, which will reach a 100% leased and 40,000 square feet of space at the GM Building. Including these leases, our New York City portfolio is 97% leased, and it has moderate near-term rollover exposure outside of Ann Taylor, which Doug described. As a reminder, we\u2019re currently recognizing zero revenue from Ann Taylor. So their extension and a portion of their space will add to our earnings in 2021. This group of signed leases also includes our 125,000 square foot lease with IDG in 140 Kendrick Street in Suburban Boston, and the next phase of our lease with Microsoft in Reston that totals a 165,000 square feet. We also have deliveries in our development pipeline that we expect will add to our revenue in 2021. We expect to commence revenue for our 200,000 square foot lease with NYU at 159 East 53rd Street in the first quarter. And later in 2021, we expect to deliver our 630,000 square foot Hub on Causeway office tower that is 94% leased, and our life science lab conversion at 200 West Street in Waltham that Doug described. Outside of the office portfolio, while we\u2019re encouraged that our hotel has reopened and our parking revenues are growing, we still expect a slow ramp-up from these areas next year. The other item to keep in mind for 2021 is in our interest expense line. We expect to repay our $850 million, 4.3% unsecured bonds in the first quarter of 2021 with cash. We do anticipate lower capitalized interest next year as we deliver developments, but the net impact is that our interest expense should be lower in 2021 than 2020. So to sum it all up, we expect our fourth quarter funds from operations to come in closely aligned with this quarter. This assumes no additional tenant write-offs. For 2021, we expect to return to earnings growth. We have signed leases that are coming in the revenue, we expect a positive mark-to-market, particularly in our Boston and San Francisco leasing, we have several lease developments delivering and we expect to benefit from lower interest expense. That said, we do have a manageable 6.5% of the portfolio subject to expiring leases next year. We\u2019re working on renewals to cover many of these leases. But for those that vacate, we anticipate an active marketing program that will include white-boxing vacant space and completing turnkey improvements in certain cases. And this could result in modestly lower occupancy in 2021 as we wait for tenant spaces to be built out to commence revenue. While we would love to provide earnings guidance as we have in the past on this call, there remains significant uncertainty as to the pandemic\u2019s length and severity and the impact on the overall economy. We hope to return to providing detailed forward-looking guidance again in the future.  That completes my remarks. Operator, I\u2019d appreciate it if you could open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Derek Johnston : Just on the work from home trends changing the dynamics of the business. We do have strong historical data on the cyclical impacts of recession on offices. But there does seem to be some evidence of a secular shift here as well. How do you view, and could you address further the possible work-from-home secular risks and office space demand? And this is specifically, as you speak directly with business leaders. Doug Linde : So, Owen you want to start? Owen Thomas : Yes. Why don\u2019t I? Well, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we continue to think that successful companies will be primarily in -- will primarily conduct their business in-person. The customers that we talk to, the other business leaders that we talk to, I think it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear to them that they\u2019re missing something with everyone working from home. Building culture, creating strategy, I hear, loss of productivity, loss of creativity, and then of course, all companies hire and on-board new employees. How do you do that, when you\u2019re working from home? So, I think the importance of the in-person workplace is clear. That being said, I do think, there will be more work-from-home offered to employees as a benefit.  And as I mentioned in my remarks, I think for companies to save office space as a result, employees will have to schedule their work-from-home, not everybody can be out on Friday. And then, when the employees come to work, they\u2019ll have to have flexible work stations and they won\u2019t be fixed. And we do have premium assets and the kind of workforce in those assets may be less inclined to want to participate in such a program in that manner. So, that\u2019s the way we see it shaking out at this time. Doug Linde : I would just add. Again, I just went through, in our -- just our Boston market, literally immediate current decisions that were made, that refuted the whole notion of work from home reducing the utilization of office space. Okay? I mean, those are just -- those are facts. Those aren\u2019t a comment by a pundit in a -- or a talking head in either the Wall Street Journal or on some evening news cast. And I\u2019d just make the other following comment, which is, in 2017there were a whole host of futurists and pundits who are describing the demise of the single vehicle utilization and the fact that autonomous cars were going to fundamentally transform the way people were going to buy and own cars and that our parking garages were going to basically become derelict structures with no utilization. I would tell you that I think a lot of the thinking that was behind that was just simply wrong. And so I think it\u2019s fair for people to describe their views on what work from home might be. But I think that there is another side of the equation, which Owen described, and we\u2019re pretty strong believers in the fact that people are going to be coming back to work in volume, and they\u2019re going to be using their office spaces. And quite frankly, in 2022, we\u2019ll know what the answer is. Derek Johnston : That\u2019s great. Switching gears. So you completed 2 developments in 3Q, both residential, obviously, a small part of your business. But given the environment, how do you anticipate lease-up and stabilization timing and your thoughts on achievable development yields versus initial underwriting? Doug Linde : So I\u2019ll give you my perspective on this, and Owen, you can chime in. The lease-up is a lot slower than it otherwise was because at the moment, people are not moving around in significant ways in urban locations. They\u2019re actually -- as you\u2019ve seen, there\u2019s been some outmigration. We expect that the lease-up is going to be prolonged, that if we thought we were going to be fully leased at the Hub on Causeway in late calendar year 2021, it\u2019s going to be in 2022. And similarly, with Skyline, I think we had a 18-month to 24-month lease-up, and it\u2019s going to be more than 24 months. I don\u2019t know, relatively speaking, how much stress there is going to be on the rents. They\u2019re really coming in the form of free rent for the most part in urban locations. And I think our yields are going to be lower. Our yields are going to be 20 basis points lower or 50 basis points lower? It will depend on that lease-up. Owen Thomas : Yes. I\u2019d say I agree with -- obviously, with that answer. I think we just comment that, both of these products are the best or among the best in their marketplace in terms of their quality, amenities and offering. And I think they will compete very well as this recovery, that Doug described, occurs. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Nick Yulico : I guess, can you mind just giving a bit of perspective on what you\u2019re seeing in rents in your markets? How much are they down? I mean I think this is 1 of the big questions everyone is trying to figure out is, what is kind of the fallout in rents been so far? And whether things could get worse as leasing activity is not really picking up here in the back half of the year? Doug Linde : So the answer to your question is nobody knows. There are just simply too few transactions to have occurred to really have any sense. And it\u2019s -- and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because there\u2019s not pent-up demand for leasing activity. I just think it\u2019s because the health crisis has just prolonged people\u2019s decision-making. I mean we are having success leasing space in 3 out of the 5 markets that we\u2019re operating in, as I described, in Boston, urban and suburban, and Northern Virginia as well as in New York City. And so I do think there is some activity, but it\u2019s not enough to \"determine\" where market rents are going to be. There\u2019s more sub-lets based on the market, and that\u2019s going to have an impact in the short-term on rental rates because, as you know, sub-let space generally gets discounted and that discounted rent is going to impact the marketplaces. But we\u2019re just not in a position where we can say how much rents are going to go down by. And then quite frankly, in a couple of our markets, we\u2019re not sure they\u2019re going to go down. I mean I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to go down in Cambridge, Massachusetts. I\u2019m not sure they\u2019re going to go down in Reston, Virginia. But there are going to be places where there is going to be some pressure. I do want to make one really important point, which is market rents on average don\u2019t drive the growth of our NOI on a medium or a short-term basis. Occupancy drives it. Whether our rents are up or down by 5% or 7% or 10%, really isn\u2019t impacting what\u2019s going on from a total revenue perspective, occupancy is what\u2019s driving that. And if we are able to, as we have in the past, drive occupancy in a weaker market because people want to migrate to better buildings, I think we will do on a relative basis well, and we will not have a significant degradation on our revenues because market rents are going down. Nick Yulico : Second question is just about kind of strategic thinking here. You talked earlier, Owen, about value not being reflected in your stock price. It is at a 10-year low. It\u2019s not just a Boston Properties issue, it\u2019s happening to other office REITs as well. I guess I\u2019m wondering at what point do you guys start thinking about doing something more strategic, look to joint venture assets, think about a stock buyback? I mean one of the points we are hearing is that longer-term lease assets with good credit tenants are selling for strong cap rates in certain markets right now. So at what point do you start looking at pieces of your portfolio in either joint venturing them or outright selling them? Thinking about recycling capital, not just into development, but maybe into your stock price or into your stock buyback, doing something along those lines? Owen Thomas : So let me answer that question, which is obviously an important one, both from a use of capital and then a -- well, source of capital, then use of capital. So let\u2019s start with source of capital. So we have been selling assets. We didn\u2019t talk about it on our opening remarks because we don\u2019t have anything active per se this quarter. But year-to-date in 2020, we\u2019ve sold over $700 million of assets. So we\u2019ve been selling. And I agree with what you\u2019re saying. I think we will continue to do that selectively with selective assets. One of the issues that we have faced in the past with this has been all of our major assets have a very significant tax gain in them. So if we sell them, we can\u2019t keep the capital or we can\u2019t keep all of it. And we have to make either a regular or special dividend as a result. But our income has dropped and our dividend has been flat, and so we can include some of these asset sale gains into our regular dividend, so we don\u2019t face that issue now. So again, we sold $700 million this year, and I would anticipate that we will continue to be selling assets at a little bit more elevated level in the next few quarters. In terms of use of capital, we clearly think about a buyback, and we think about in the context of the following : one, how much of a difference would it make to our earnings; two, what would the rating agency impact be depending on size; three, what\u2019s the course of the pandemic and what are our needs for capital going to be in the coming quarters; and fourth, what capital do we want to allocate to new investment opportunities. As I mentioned, we\u2019re seeing more of that this past quarter, and my expectation is, that will elevate further. We have brought in joint venture partners to help us fund new investment opportunities, which will help. But given that balance of all those factors, to-date, we have elected not to use our capital to repurchase. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi. Michael Bilerman : It\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Manny. Owen, you gave a second half of \u201821 sort of outlook for return to the office, I guess, which is -- appears, I think, probably more realistic at this point given where the densities are. But how do you sort of see things evolving between now and then? And what are the sort of key indicators that you\u2019re looking for to get to that point? And do you feel like that\u2019s an outside date that perhaps would come earlier or do you view that as something that maybe could bleed into 2022? Owen Thomas : Yes. Michael, the one thing that we\u2019re following to try to assess when the recovery could occur is what\u2019s the course of the virus? What\u2019s the daily infection rate? Are we beating this thing? I think that\u2019s the most important factor. And so as we think about the 2021, our assumption is that a vaccine will get approved, and it will be -- it will work for many people. And so then that vaccine has to be -- new doses have to be manufactured. It has to be distributed. There may be people that won\u2019t take the vaccine. It may not work for everyone. But it\u2019s going to take a while for that to work through the system. And then, look, I think we all need to follow the health safety guidelines more carefully as a country. I think that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing the virus blooming in parts of the country because the basic health safety protocols are not being followed. And I\u2019m hopeful that more and more people will do that and that will help as well.  So it\u2019s a hard thing to assess. Our best guess or judgment at this point is that it is in the middle of next year. But to answer your question, could it happen faster? Yes, we certainly hope it does. Could it get delayed? I think it could. But our best case in thinking about the future or most likely case would be sometime in the middle of the year. Michael Bilerman : Your organization as well as a lot of other sort of office companies obviously are coming back to their offices a lot faster and a lot more denser than other corporations. And Doug shared some of the examples of some of the leasing that\u2019s been done over the course of this pandemic, showing that there is certain tenants that are willing to take up the space. But what are you -- in your discussions with other leaders, what are they looking for in terms of elements to make it much more of an opt-out rather than an opt-in? And what can you do as a landlord to help your tenants? And I think about a lot of the shopping center landlords that have the restaurant tenant clearly not doing as much business, and they realize they got to be partners with them to help them stay in business. And so what can you do? Or is there any programs that you\u2019re trying with the tenants that are more willing to come back? Owen Thomas : Yes. Let me start, and I\u2019ll turn it over to Doug for any additional color. So there\u2019s a couple of things I would mention. First of all, we try to have -- and believe we have an industry-leading health security plan that we put together with outside medical experts. We posted on our website, we\u2019ve met with hundreds of our customers. We don\u2019t want the coming to the office building to be the obstacle for someone or a company to come back into the office. And we don\u2019t -- do not think it is. Clearly, at the census levels that Doug and I described in our remarks, I don\u2019t think the office is the obstacle for people coming back to work. I continue -- and then the other thing that we are doing as a company is trying to set an example. We\u2019re all in our offices. We\u2019re using public -- well, not all, but many of us are in our offices, we\u2019re using public transportation, knock on wood, we\u2019re not getting sick. We\u2019re trying to set an example. But I do think as business leaders look at this situation and look at this decision today, it kind of goes back to the -- my answer to your last question, which is what\u2019s the course of the virus? How safe is it? How -- what are the infection rates in my locality? And can I ask my employees to go back to work, given that there may be some health security issues at some point in the chain of the commute? Doug Linde : And Michael, obviously, the difference between retail and office is that our customers are not suffering the gross decline in revenues from their businesses because they\u2019re not \"altogether\" at the same time, right? They\u2019re clearly not as productive. They\u2019re clearly not as effective. They\u2019re clearly not growing in many cases, but they\u2019re not suffering like a restaurant or a soft goods retailer who is dependent upon physical traffic to basically make a revenue. The issues that leaders, I believe, are facing are, there are still issues associated with schools. And unfortunately, that\u2019s not something Boston Properties or any private company can solve. And until it\u2019s very clear that the school systems across the country, private and public, are able to function in a \"in-person manner,\" there\u2019s going to be a hesitancy of business leaders to \"demand\" that their people come back to work. That\u2019s just -- it\u2019s just not going to happen. Getting back to sort of your first question about what could happen that would be better? If the drugs are really effective, I believe that they will get a higher utilization rate in terms of people actually being vaccinated if there\u2019s a very, very high effective rate. If the drugs aren\u2019t that effective, I think there\u2019s going to be a slower take-up of those vaccinations. So depending upon the efficacy of these things, you could see a surprise one way or the other relative to how quickly people want to be vaccinated and when those people are vaccinated, how much more comfortable they feel getting back out and about, again, with social distancing and with masks, right, as precautions, but where they feel much more comfortable being active members of society. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Alexander Goldfarb : So just a few questions. First, Doug, you mentioned the leasing activity, whatever you\u2019re putting in the water at the GM building, I\u2019d say, maybe keep putting it in there. But was most struck by your average lease term of 7-year deals, speaking to brokers in -- especially in New York, just hearing a lot of short-term deals, tenants just doing short-term extensions, but it sounds like your deals this quarter and what you\u2019re talking about are more long-term deals. So can you just give us more color if this was just sort of nuance and the cadence of leasing? Or if there\u2019s something particular in the tenants that you\u2019re discussing with where they feel more comfortable doing long-term deals versus short-term wait-and-sees? Doug Linde : I think that the profile of our customers are companies that have a long-term view that their office space is very important to them and that the pandemic is a short-term phenomenon that is not going to impact their long-term space utilization trends, and so they\u2019re making long-term decisions. And fortunately, there are a lot of those customers across our marketplaces that we have relationships with. And as I described with Ameriprise and Columbia Threadneedle, I mean, we -- there\u2019s a company that didn\u2019t have to come to us, and we literally manufactured space for them, and they were thrilled to be in our building. So part of it\u2019s the type of the customer and part of it is our operating prowess. This is what we do. And we try and do these things all the time through good markets and bad markets. We take what the market is giving us relative to rental rates and concessions, and we do deals. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then the second question is out in California. You mentioned San Francisco is now allowing people back in the office. It sounds like LA is still closed. Some of your -- some of the other companies out there have talked about the issue with rent collection, with the eviction moratoriums where tenants feel like it\u2019s sort of voluntary to pay rent. But maybe you could just give an update on what\u2019s going on with sublease in San Francisco? And then just general office trends, if, in fact, people are still working from home in large part, how that\u2019s going to shake out? And where you -- and what you think the longer-term impact is from some of these eviction moratoriums that seem to get extended each time a deadline approaches? Doug Linde : Yes. So again, I think Owen described and Mike described that our collections for our office tenants were almost 99% this quarter -- or this month and that continues. We have not had any pickup in sort of conversations or concerns relative to our collections with our office tenants. And so we\u2019re not having eviction problems with our tenants on the commercial side. With regard to sub-let space in San Francisco, so if you go back to 2001, sub-let space as a percentage of the total inventory, I think, was in the mid-40s. And then in \u201809 during the Great Recession, it was sort of in the 20% range. And this time, it\u2019s closer to the mid-40s. So I think it\u2019s probably going to feel more like the dotcom than it is the Great Recession relative to the amount of sub-let space that\u2019s available. I think the difference is that the health of the companies right now are very strong. And so it\u2019s a question of when they\u2019re going to be prepared to start making business decisions again when they have some degree of comfort about when they can get their people back to work And when they can start hiring people in a significant way when they\u2019re going to want to have them altogether. And that\u2019s the $64,000 question in San Francisco, which is a technology-dependent market. I mean those companies are, relatively speaking, doing really, really well. And so we are optimistic that when we get through the pandemic-related issues, there\u2019s going to be a pickup in activity in San Francisco. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : I guess, first, I wanted to just touch on the life science, Doug, you guys have spent a lot of time highlighting a number of either new parcels you\u2019ve picked up, conversions. Just maybe kind of big picture, give us a sense for kind of where life sciences today, where do you think it\u2019s going in Boston, in particular. I know that there\u2019s a lot of space either under construction or to be built, you may be part of that pipeline. But, what concerns do you have about the increasing supply in life science? Doug Linde : So, I think today, we\u2019re -- Mike, we\u2019re about 6%? Mike LaBelle : Yes. 6% of the Company is leased to life science companies. Doug Linde : And so look, I think, the reason that everyone is, I think, focusing on life science at the moment is because there\u2019s demand, right? It\u2019s about the demand that in -- particularly in certain key markets, Cambridge, Waltham, Lexington and Boston now being probably the pinnacle of that in the country. And so, we have an enormous number of early and late-stage companies that are moving forward with their business models and that are looking for space. And so, it\u2019s that desire for the tenants to want space that is creating the opportunity to build those buildings. And everything we are doing is we\u2019re saying, okay, we\u2019re going to take our office buildings and we\u2019re going to design the kind of office building we want to design. And then, we\u2019re going to make sure that that building also has the infrastructure from a HVAC and from a loading and from a chemical storage and neutralization perspective that will allow for easy life science utilization at the same time. And then, depending upon what the tenant wants, we\u2019ll build a life science installation or we\u2019ll build an office installation, and we\u2019ll figure that out on the go. And generally, as we\u2019ve I think seen we\u2019re quite confident and capable of doing this. And it\u2019s really a question of tenant demand that\u2019s going to drive which way the product mix goes. There is clearly a lot of companies that are looking at doing these types of conversions. Whether they\u2019ll all be successful, you\u2019re bet is as good as mine. The locations are becoming a little bit more dispersed. The echo centers of Cambridge is, I think, in most people\u2019s minds built out. Although we are actually, knock on wood, trying to get a significant amount of new permits through the city that will allow us to expand our portfolio in Kendall Square. So, people are looking far out. They\u2019re looking at Watertown, they\u2019re looking at Summerville, they\u2019re looking in south of the city of Boston, and then, they\u2019re looking Walton Lexington. And the Walton Lexington, I think, is probably where we\u2019re focusing most of our attention. A, we control land out there; B, we know the brokers who are representing these tenants and where these tenants likely want to be, and they want to be in those western suburbs, it\u2019s also more affordable. And there\u2019s a significant amount of demand that\u2019s out there, which is what we\u2019re trying to serve. Owen Thomas : One of the additional comments from the Boston region that we\u2019re finding is that we clearly have the competitive advantage with our basis, not only in land or in the buildings that we\u2019re converting. And the strategy of taking these incremental pieces of buildings that we already own has really played out. And what we\u2019re hearing over and over again from these companies is predictability is so incredibly important to them. And that gets back to Doug\u2019s comment on operating prowess and then our ability to not only get the permits in these existing assets, but deliver in a very predictable basis. It\u2019s been said over and over again recently that this is so important to them. So, it plays well for our strategy in Boston. Steve Sakwa : Okay. And just as a quick follow-up, is there any sort of update on your joint venture with Alexandria in South San Francisco? Doug Linde : I think, I made two comments. So, first is, we have a tenant and we signed a letter of intent with an office tenant for the 601 Gateway Building to take about 70,000 square feet of space. And, our plans are, the first thing I think we\u2019re -- the venture is going to do is they\u2019re going to vacate 651 Gateway and make that building into a lab building. It\u2019s currently an office building. So, I think, that\u2019s the first thing. And then, there\u2019s a building that is under design for -- I think, it\u2019s 180,000 square feet, which is the next building, but we\u2019ll probably be in a position to deliver 651 as a lab building before we get that other building underway. Steve Sakwa : Okay. And then, maybe a question for Mike. Just I wanted to circle back, when you talked about revenue recognition, I think, you said it was 581,000 square feet starting in 1Q \u201821. And I know you have leases expiring next year. But, what is the average sort of -- or average rent on that roughly 600,000 feet that kicks in, in 1Q \u201821? Mike LaBelle : Well, the reason I gave you kind of where it\u2019s located is to provide some insight into what that is, without giving you the exact rents. But, I mean, 170,000 square feet is at 399 and 40,000 square feet is at the GM Building. So, those are rents that are -- those are high rent buildings, right? So, those are close to $100 or certainly over $100 for the GM Building. And then, the other two big slugs of that is suburban Boston, where the average rent in suburban Boston is probably mid-40s, high-40s, and that\u2019s the 125,000 square feet. And then, the Reston, rents are right around $50 a square foot, where, again, we signed a big lease with Microsoft for 400,000 square feet last quarter, and it goes in, in phases. So, a portion of it went in, in the second quarter, 165,000 square feet of it is going in, in the first quarter of \u201821. And then, I think, it\u2019s another 50,000 or 60,000 square feet that goes in later in 2021. And that\u2019s all kind of in addition to the other renewal we did with them this quarter, which was about 160,000 square feet; and then, two incremental expansions, which was 45,000 square feet in one of the Freedom Square buildings, and then they basically took all of one of the Discovery Square building. So, the lease we mentioned in our press release was 186,000 square feet, and that was basically them extending long term and then taking the last additional floor they didn\u2019t have in Discovery Square. So that\u2019s been quite successful. So, those expansions which went into place this quarter, again, the rents in Reston are right around $50 a square foot. So, that was intended to give you some insight into the impact from those deals. Steve Sakwa : All right. And then, as the Athena 150,000-foot that\u2019s not part of the 581, that would be in addition too? Mike LaBelle : Yes. That\u2019s not part of the 581. The expectation is, hopefully, we\u2019ll be able to get that deal signed. It is not signed yet. It is under discussion. But, we think they want to stay in the building. They\u2019re going to contract by probably 150,000 square feet. And then, they\u2019re going to continue to take 150,000 square feet on kind of a medium-term basis with no kind of out-of-pocket cost for us. So, it\u2019s beneficial to us. So, I\u2019d say the rent is a little bit below what we would otherwise get for that building, but there\u2019s no cost and it\u2019s medium term, and we\u2019re keeping occupancy. So, it\u2019s beneficial to us. And I think that they should start paying rent at the beginning of 2021. And right now, again, we are not recognizing any revenue for any of that space. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Jamie Feldman : Great. Thank you. Owen, you had commented on the distribution at a 5% yield. Can you guys just discuss the safety of that 5%? And as we kind of work our way through the pandemic, risk that it goes lower or even opportunity that it goes higher? Mike LaBelle : So, are you touching on the dividend, Jamie? Jamie Feldman : Yes, dividend coverage. Mike LaBelle : So, the dividend coverage, right, has gone to 110% the last couple of quarters because we\u2019ve had these rent deferrals that we\u2019ve done that has affected our cash NOI. Our parking and our hotel are obviously way off. And then, this quarter, we had a little bit of occupancy degradation on top of that. And as Owen described, we think that this is going to continue until these parts of the business start to improve, and then our development starts to come in line. And what we\u2019re doing is, we\u2019re selling some assets that have gains in them, and we\u2019re able to be comfortable that we\u2019re maintaining our regular dividend without having to do a special dividend. And we\u2019re kind of opportunistically doing this. So, if you include the gains on sales, we\u2019ve got plenty of cash flow to cover our dividend. There\u2019s no kind of concerns with that. We have no concerns at this point with our dividend. And as you look further out and you look at the development pipeline coming in and the income that that is going to create and the cash flow that that is going to create, our view is that in future years, we\u2019re going to be back to increasing our dividend. So, that\u2019s -- there\u2019s no kind of view here, at this point, that we\u2019re going to reduce it. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then, it was helpful to hear, I think, you said 15% increase in parking quarter-over-quarter. Are there any other line items that you can talk about sequentially that kind of give a picture of where things are heading, or anything got worse or anything got better? Doug Linde : So, I would just say, Jamie -- this is Doug that -- so look, the hotel and the parking are unlikely to improve materially relative to where they were in 2019 in the first half of 2021. That\u2019s our view. And, again, the parking revenue is driven by two things. Monthly parkers who are office tenants who are coming to work a significant portion of the week, and transient retail in Boston and in Cambridge and in Washington D.C., for people who are enjoying the urban nature of those cities. And, our view is that the first half of 2021 is going to be a lot closer to how it feels today than it felt in 2019. Again, we talked about the health issues, and we talked about that\u2019s really what\u2019s leading our economic viewpoint. And so, while you may see sequential increases, we\u2019re down by -- from such a low bar, it\u2019s not going to be a material difference. And again, the hotel was closed in the second quarter and it was closed in the third quarter, and it\u2019s going to basically be breakeven from an operating basis in the fourth quarter of 2020 and probably the first quarter of 2021, again, because there is just no business travel. So, people should anticipate and it should not be a surprise to anybody that those line items continue to be materially impacted by what\u2019s going on from a COVID perspective. But, when they come back, they\u2019re going to come back really strong, and the question is when. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then, finally, we get the question a lot of just if people were to reduce their office space, what kind of impact is that to their total operating costs. Could you just provide some color maybe from the conversations you have had with tenants about how much of a cost savings it really could be to their bottom line? Doug Linde : We have never had those conversations directly with a tenant. I mean, we see from all of the tenants that are public companies, how much their rent is as a portion of their gross revenues or their gross margins, and it\u2019s not very material with the financial institutions and the asset managers, I mean, they\u2019re -- it\u2019s immaterial, probably under 5%. With some of the professional services firms, they have two costs. They have payroll and they have real estate. And my guess is that payroll is vastly larger than their real estate on a relative basis. But, it\u2019s a lot easier to quote unquote, reduce your headcount or your occupancy cost than it is to reduce your payroll, right? It\u2019s just the emotion associated with that. So, I don\u2019t think that very many companies are thinking about utilization of space as a way to, quote unquote, materially change their margins, unless they\u2019re in trouble, because the recession has dramatically reduced their overall revenues. And then, everything is on the table, and it really doesn\u2019t matter how much one is of the other. They\u2019re just looking at shed costs wherever possible. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Just maybe first building on one of the life sciences questions. This is obviously, as you highlighted, a lot of interest, a lot of demand. On the private equity side, there have been recaps or potential sales, REITs and other sectors have obviously been very active. I\u2019m just sort of wondering where the footprint is today in Cambridge, how you\u2019re thinking about -- you\u2019ve talked about conversions and development. How are you thinking about potential acquisitions in light of the comment you made about your pipeline building and/or potentially growing the life science piece of business in other markets? Owen Thomas : Yes. So, Vikram, I\u2019ll start, and Doug and Mike might want to jump in. So, as -- in terms of our current footprint, as you heard, about 6% of our revenue comes from life science tenants today. We have about 2 million square feet of redevelopment opportunities in our existing portfolio, some of which is already underway. And then, we have now about 4.5 million square feet of new development opportunities. All of this is under control, some of it through option. And as Bryan mentioned, it\u2019s all on what I\u2019d call -- the basis was established prior to all of this life science fervor that\u2019s in the marketplace. So, that\u2019s a huge benefit to us. So, we feel that we can materially grow our life science presence as a company, executing well on the opportunities that we already control. And Boston -- and those opportunities are primarily in Boston and San Francisco, which represents the majority of all of the lab and life science space in the country anyway. That being said, we\u2019re not blind to new opportunities, and there are a number of them out there, and we are looking at them. And there\u2019s certainly a possibility that we could add to our portfolio, maybe even in a market where we are currently operating, but do not have a life science presence, and we\u2019re considering things like that. But again, I would make the point, our life science business is going to grow, based on the assets that we can currently control. Vikram Malhotra : And then, I\u2019m just hoping to get more color. You mentioned from a value perspective, higher quality buildings are trading at pre-COVID levels, whether it\u2019s more work or lower quality, there\u2019s a big bid-ask. Just wondering kind of what you\u2019re hearing in terms of who those potential buyers are for that second category. And, is there any sense you have of what the -- actually what the bid-ask is? Just maybe give us a sense of where values for certain types of properties could go over the next moths? Owen Thomas : Yes. So, first of all, the assets that are trading, if you looked at that list that I went through, there are two -- they are either one in -- one of two categories. They\u2019re either life science or life science related, or they have a long weighted average lease term. In other words, there is no leasing risk in the property. So, buildings that have leasing risk, a 5%, 10%, 15% turnover per year, or have some existing vacancy, buyers are going to assume lower market rents in most -- in many of our markets, and probably slower lease-up, given the volume of leasing activity is less. So, owners of those assets, and when you do that underwriting, that results in a discount to the value than it was pre-COVID when assumptions about market rent and the velocity of leasing were higher. And I do think a lot of owners, when they\u2019re faced with that decision or -- they are going to say, well, I don\u2019t want to sell it now. I believe in the full recovery of the office market, and the interest rates are very low, I\u2019m just going to refinance and hold on. So, we just don\u2019t see that many trades. And I think, Vikram, to answer your question, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s that many deals you can actually look at to price it. And second, in terms of the value drop, I think, it\u2019s highly dependent on the characteristics of the building, a building that\u2019s got just -- that\u2019s fully leased, that\u2019s got typical rollover, 5% or 10% a year. That one is probably not going to go down that much. But something that is 30% vacant today or faces higher rollover rates, that will go down more. So, I think, the answer to your question is based on the specific characteristics of the building. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Blaine Heck : Thanks. Good morning. Just looking forward to 2021 on the office side, I think, Mike touched on this. But, it looks like San Francisco and Boston make up the majority of your expirations, about 56% of next year\u2019s expirations between the two of them. Doug, you mentioned that you still have significant upside in those particular markets. So, I\u2019m wondering if you could talk about where you thinkthe mark-to-market is in those markets as it stands today. And how much should that help in your ability to report positive spreads next year? Doug Linde : So, it depends again on the particular building. In general, in San Francisco, if we were in the fourth quarter of 2019, I would tell you that average rents were -- across our portfolio, were in excess of $100 gross. Okay? So, if the $61 a square foot gross number represents the 114,000 square feet of space that we already have pre-exercise relative to renewals, there\u2019s still -- there\u2019s a significant embedded growth there. Our properties down in Mountain View that are expiring are probably expiring somewhere in the range of $36 to $40 triple net. And in the fourth quarter of 2019, rents were probably somewhere in the neighborhood of $60 triple net. And interestingly, I\u2019d say, of all of the markets in our -- in the quote unquote, California part of our portfolio, the market that\u2019s held up the best has been Silicon Valley, because there\u2019s a lot of engineering work and a lot of maker work, and those companies are still doing their thing, and there\u2019s still VC money that\u2019s funding those companies. So, that market has seen much, much less sublet space come on the market. In the Greater Boston marketplace, we -- again, it depends on the buildings. All the conversions we\u2019re doing have enormous embedded increases because we\u2019re going from somewhere in the mid to high-20s on a net basis to somewhere at a minimum in the low 50s on a net basis. And then, in our CBD portfolio, the current rents pre-COVID were somewhere between $75 and $85 a square foot on average across our portfolio. And my guess is, our expiring rents were somewhere in the 60s a square foot. So just to give you -- those sort of gives you a sense of sort of where things are. Blaine Heck : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Just to be clear, you\u2019re quoting those Q4 \u201819 rents just because you haven\u2019t seen enough on the transaction side to give current rents? Doug Linde : Yes. So, I\u2019m allowing you to say. I think, rents are going to go down by 5%, 10%, 15%, whatever you think they are, and you can do the math however you want to do it. Blaine Heck : Fair enough. Okay. And then first of all, congratulations on the VW lease, Reston Next and great to see that project get up to 85%. So, I think that\u2019s certainly the main thing to focus on here. But, a few questions around that. I think, Doug, you mentioned that Fannie Mae decrease their space requirement to around 700,000 square feet, which is down from their original agreement for 850,000 square feet. Can you just confirm that the giveback was -- the reduction in requirement would solely to accommodate VW\u2019s lease or was it something else? And given that this is their second time decreasing the space requirement, do we think there\u2019s any chance they\u2019re looking to downsize anymore? Lastly, how does VW\u2019s rent compared to what you agreed on with Fannie Mae? Doug Linde : Well, Ray or Peter, do you want to take that question? Ray Ritchey : I\u2019ll take a shot at it, Doug. This is Ray Ritchey -- go ahead, Peter. You go ahead. Peter Johnston : No. Well, I was just going to say that Fannie delivered a car properties built them a very large complex downtown, which is actually their headquarters that delivered a number of years ago. And their operating history in that property led them to revisit the actual space needs and the way they were operating in the space. That was the reason for the initial reduction. And Ray, you probably want to add to that? Ray Ritchey : Yes. In order to make the Volkswagen deal -- Volkswagen was interested in our complex before, but we didn\u2019t have enough space. And so, when Fannie voluntarily gave back three floors, it gave us an opening to go back to VW and make an offer. And what prevailed there was not so much the economics, but just the quality of the location, its visibility, access to metro and amenities. And in order to do the deals, we had to negotiate with Fannie taking back two more floors, which they really didn\u2019t want to do, but they wanted to be good partners with us, so we ended up concluding the deal with Fannie. And in terms of rent, we\u2019re just not going to comment on what one rent looks in comparison to another. But, I would just say, it\u2019s very much consistent with our pro forma. Doug Linde : So, I just want to want to make one general comment here, because I think people sort of -- they don\u2019t appreciate it. So, what we accomplished in Reston and what we accomplished, for example, with Columbia, at Atlantic Wharf, these are hard manufactured deals. And we took these tenants from going to other places where they were -- in the case of Fannie Mae -- excuse me, VW, I believe, there was a signed letter of intent and a lease that was in negotiation. And we were able to get the space and say, by the way, we can deliver the space, trust us, it\u2019s going to be complicated, but we can get to there. And similarly, with the Ameriprise Columbia Group. I mean, this is what we do all the time to maintain occupancy in our portfolio. And I think it\u2019s what differentiates us from many of the people who are in our \"competitive marketplaces,\" and it\u2019s where the value creation is. So, when you think about the office market and you think about what\u2019s going on in a macro perspective with concessions and with where rents might be, just have the underlying perspective that we can do things in tough markets that other people might not want to do or can\u2019t do and maintain our occupancy in our portfolio in a way that really puts us in a very good standing relative to our underlying revenues and our underlying FFO and our underlying AFFO and our cash flow. Ray Ritchey : Doug, if I could just add to that? This is Ray again. In Reston, on the Microsoft deal, we did a new deal with Microsoft for 400,000 square feet, which we\u2019re incredibly grateful to do. But, in doing so, we had to relocate another 250,000 square feet of existing tenants to other buildings. And so, when you have a critical mass, like in Reston Town Center or in Cambridge Center or in Embarcadero Center, that scale and size of our portfolio really allows us to be creative on deal structure and to accommodate both, tenants growth and contractions without losing the tenant outside our portfolio of buildings. So, really one of the strengths of the concentration of efforts in certain geographic areas. Blaine Heck : Certainly a great outcome. I just wanted to get some color around the moving pieces. And I appreciate the commentary from all of you. Thanks. Ray Ritchey : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Ardie Kamran : This is Ardie Kamran on for Craig. I appreciate the color on the transaction market and kind of the difference between kind of the stabilized assets versus those with lease-up risk Just wondering, given that you guys are kind of going to be more active on the acquisition front, or a good portion of those assets in the pipeline in that value-add category where we see a widening bid-ask spread. And kind of how are you guys thinking about underwriting those assets, given obviously the uncertainty surrounding rent levels and maybe CapEx needs in the medium term? Thank you. Owen Thomas : Yes. No, I -- this is Owen, again. So, absolutely, I -- our new investment pipeline is going to focus on value-added opportunities. As Doug was describing, that\u2019s our strength, our ability to execute, to attract tenants, to secure tenants, to build buildings on time and on budget to re-imagine existing buildings, those are the types of things that we want to get involved in. And I think, over time, and we saw it this past quarter, I do think more opportunities like that will present themselves. And, we are going to have to adjust our underwriting. Again, it depends on the market. As Doug was describing earlier, I think, some of our markets have been perhaps relatively unaffected from a rental rate standpoint, given their strength and others have been more affected. But, we will have to adjust our underwriting, both in terms of rents, concessions and lease-up velocity to be mindful of the current environment. Ardie Kamran : Great, thanks. And just one quick one. Can you guys talk about if there\u2019s any increase in sublease space, if that\u2019s picking up at all, within the portfolio? Doug Linde : There is absolutely more sublet space in October of 2020 than there was in March of 2020 in our portfolio. Is it meaningful? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s meaningful, but there are certainly -- I can -- I know of a handful of our tenants that have said, hey, if we could get someone to take our space, we\u2019ll get off of our space. I mean, the biggest example of that is CV Star in our portfolio in Manhattan where they have a lot of term left on their lease. Again, it\u2019s not because there is a financial problem with that tenant. They\u2019re just -- they\u2019re trying to be opportunistic. And to the extent that they\u2019re able to find somebody for that space, I don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll do with their people, but we\u2019ll deal with it. But, there are those types of examples throughout the portfolio, but not in significant numbers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya with Mizuho Securities. Omotayo Okusanya : Good morning, everyone. Could you just share your latest thoughts around [indiscernible] kind of on the eve of the elections? Doug Linde : Bob, are you on? Bob Pester : I\u2019m here. I think that it\u2019s very close right now, but I don\u2019t think it will pass. Omotayo Okusanya : And is that based on you just kind of think [indiscernible] would be a little different on doing election day or... Bob Pester : Just based on the polling we\u2019ve been seeing. Omotayo Okusanya : Just based on -- okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, just to confirm around life sciences, based on your comments that you guys are more interested in just kind of building your portfolio rather than actively buying it. So, is it fair to say some of the portfolios out there that are potentially up for sale, you\u2019re not actively looking at them? Doug Linde : No. We are looking, absolutely. I think, the point is -- and we have, we\u2019re in the market. We\u2019re a life science player. We\u2019re going to look at new acquisitions. And we will make those acquisitions if we think they make sense. But, the point I\u2019m trying to stress is, we don\u2019t need to do that to grow the life science component of Boston Properties materially, based on the development opportunities and redevelopment opportunities that we currently control. Omotayo Okusanya : Got you. So, would you say something about the characteristics of the Brookfield portfolio? I mean a lot of it is in Boston and Cambridge. Is that something that would attract you, or is it just the nature of the location doesn\u2019t really attract you? Doug Linde : Yes. Look, we don\u2019t want to comment on specific investments that we\u2019re looking at or pursuing, but I think it\u2019s our job to understand everything that\u2019s in the market. And if we think we can create a value-creation opportunity for shareholders to chase it. So, clearly, that\u2019s something that\u2019s on our radar screen. Omotayo Okusanya : Okay. And one\u2026 Doug Linde : By the way, we follow the market carefully. I mentioned, I believe, five specific asset sales in my remarks, and four of them were on buildings that were almost immediately adjacent or very proximate to buildings that we have. So, we\u2019re always in the market in the Class A office and life science space in our core markets. Omotayo Okusanya : Got you. And if we just indulge one more. Development, the delays in the quarter, could you just tell that -- and I hope I didn\u2019t missed this before, but what exactly caused some of the delays? Is it just having had a time getting leases signed, or what\u2019s causing some of the delays in the development pipeline? Mike LaBelle : So, I mean, we really haven\u2019t delayed. I mean, 159 East 53rd Street, we have pushed that asset back and it\u2019s really related to the build-out, it has nothing to do with what we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve completed our obligation a year ago, and we\u2019ve been getting cash rent from that tenant for over a year. And, it\u2019s sitting in prepaid rent on our balance sheet. And as soon as we can deliver this thing, it\u2019s actually going to come in. So, that one, again, we\u2019re kind of reliant upon the build-out timeframe on that. And then, we pushed 200 West Street stabilization out a little bit. But, Doug described, got a letter of intent signed for the entire building. And that\u2019s when the tenant is going to complete their build-out. And we hope to have that be signed shortly. And 20 CityPoint, we also have an LOI for that entire building. And that tenant\u2019s build-out is going to be completed in Q3 of 2021. So, we\u2019re basically just adjusting based on leasing activity that\u2019s going on in the pipeline. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Frank Lee with BMO. Frank Lee : I just want to touch on the rent write-offs taken so far. Do you have a sense of how much percent of the uncollected rents do they account for? And were there any reserves taken on your co-working tenants? Mike LaBelle : In terms of uncollected rents, I\u2019m not sure what the exact percentage is on the existing AR. We do have deferred rents that we described in the quarter, which are rents where we are accruing for those tenants, and that was $18 million. So, those are, I guess, rents where we wrote off $6 million of AR, and we still have $18 million that came in this quarter that were deferring. So, I think that will give you a sense. We did have one co-working tenant that we wrote off this quarter, but it was a smaller exposure that we have. So, we do still have a couple of co-working tenants in the portfolio that continue to pay us on a current basis, and that we have not taken write-offs for. Frank Lee : Okay, great. And then, Doug, you mentioned the GM Building has been the most active in your portfolio. Can you provide some additional color what\u2019s driving this? Doug Linde : John Powers, do you want to take that one? John Powers : Yes. Well, I think, it\u2019s a great building. And the type of tenants that are in the building are financial tenants mostly, or family offices, et cetera. I think, there we have some vacancy in the building. That\u2019s one of the reasons, of course, that they\u2019re looking, but this is a very attractive building, and we\u2019ve had a good flow. We\u2019re also putting an amenity center in the building that has been very, very well received by the tenants sort of looking and also those tenants that have done leases with us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Ismail with Green Street. Daniel Ismail : Great. As you\u2019re looking at redeveloping in Waltham or at your land bank and other markets, has the entitlement process changed this year, gotten easier or any harder, given the worsening situations in most these cities and states? Doug Linde : Bryan, do you want to take that one? Bryan Koop : We\u2019ve really seen no change at the local level in terms of these towns. In fact, in some cases, it\u2019s been more expeditious, believe it or not just being able to get people more on Zoom calls. Where we have seen some great improvement is our work with the state. And a great example of that that we\u2019re going to be coming out with the best on is our improvement at the intersection at CityPoint. Our team was able to get that intersection work done. And in four months, it\u2019s up and running, which probably would have taken a year to a year and a half, previously. So, it\u2019s been an opportunity to partnership with the -- not only the city of Waltham, but the state of Massachusetts to get that work done quicker. So, that\u2019s where we have seen improvement. Daniel Ismail : And then, relatedly, any update on the MTA sites and in Manhattan? Doug Linde : John? John Powers : Well, we continue to work on the site with the MTA and city planning, and we\u2019re about to enter into the ULURP process, our application -- meaning our application will be accepted. I think that will happen sometime in the first quarter. We are moving forward as the agent for MTA for the demolition of the site, and we\u2019re starting that. We\u2019ve awarded that contract, and the early demolition work is starting. So it\u2019s going to take about a year to take the building down. We have not -- go ahead. Daniel Ismail : No. Please, go ahead. John Powers : Yes. So, we are still negotiating the ground lease agreement with the MTA. We are now currently acting as the agent on the development site for the demolition. Daniel Ismail : Great. I appreciate the color. And then, maybe going back to remote working, I appreciate all the real world examples you guys have provided on the call thus far. But, is it fair to say that you have not noticed any meaningful differences between regions and industries for the demand for office space, specifically as it relates to remote working? Doug Linde : It\u2019s an impossible question to answer, Danny, because there\u2019s relatively speaking, different impacts on the ability for companies to do business, based upon the geographic locations. So, I mean, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a surprise that the activity level in Boston, the activity level in Northern Virginia and the activity level in New York are greatly -- more significant than the activity level we\u2019re seeing in Los Angeles and San Francisco. And Los Angeles and San Francisco have been the governments that have been most restrictive about going back to work and where many companies in the technology space that quote unquote, can work from home, are located. So, those organizations have been at the forefront of not being allowed to come back to work. And so, I think it\u2019s impacted their ability to sort of understand and know from a leasing activity perspective and from a space utilization perspective, what the world is going to feel like when they\u2019re able to start to do things in a more consistent basis. And again, so we would anticipate that if we\u2019re getting out of the COVID restrictions in the middle of 2021 in a significant way that we will start to see those organizations bringing their people back to work and then making decisions as to how it\u2019s going to -- how it actually impacted their productivity and their collaboration and their ability to get their business goals accomplished. And if they couldn\u2019t do those things, we think they will need to take more space to be able to fit those people to the extent that they decide that there\u2019s a portion of their population that can work partially from home. And they can, as Owen said, share their physical platforms amongst each other as opposed to having dedicated platforms to an individual, then they won\u2019t need more space. But, I just think it\u2019s impossible to answer the question because everyone is in a different place relative to the -- where the governments are allowing them to go from a health security perspective, and as we\u2019ve seen, even where the restrictions have been lifted, the social issues associated with particularly educational systems have put companies that are really positioned relative to quote unquote demanding the people come back to work. Unidentified Company Representative : One of the things that we\u2019re talking about, we\u2019re passing along to leadership to Doug and Owen as we\u2019ve had incredibly deep conversations with our clients in Boston, mainly because we\u2019re having this access to them that we\u2019ve never had before as they talk about their space and they\u2019re more focused on it than ever. And one of the CEOs put it really well to us, he said, I\u2019m really concerned about uphill work. And what he meant by it was downhill work is your email work, your compulsory stuff that you do as a day-to-day basis. But, uphill work being strategy, projects, heavy lifting about creating value is the biggest concern. And I thought it was a great metaphor because that is the theme we\u2019re hearing over and over from our clients. And the fact that we\u2019re having these deep conversations on it, I think, shows the importance of office space. But, we\u2019ve been passing this along the leadership. And while it\u2019s still anecdotal, it\u2019s pretty strong message about the need for future value creation, and the portion of that that workspace is going to play in that. Operator : I will now turn the call back over to the speakers for any closing remarks. Owen Thomas : Thank you, operator. I think that concludes our remarks, concludes all the questions. Thank you for your interest in Boston Properties. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s Boston Properties conference call. Thank you again for attending. And have a good day.",

At this time, we would like to inform you that certain statements made during this conference call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Boston Properties believes the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its expectations will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements were detailed in yesterday's press release and from time to time in the Company's filings with the SEC. The Company does not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements. I'd like to welcome Owen Thomas, Chief Executive Officer; Doug Linde, President; and Mike LaBelle, Chief Financial Officer. During the Q&A portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, Senior Executive, Vice President, and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks. Owen Thomas : Thank you, Sara, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to depart from my typical organizational remarks and instead summarize all the reasons why we are confident in Boston Properties' future prospects and enthusiastic about the Company's growth potential at this unique point in time. As part of my comments, I will address accomplishments and challenges of the past year, current capital and property markets conditions, as well as Boston Properties' capital allocation decisions and strategy. So why BXP and why now? I will begin with three points on Boston Properties' potential for income growth, both in the short and long-term from where we closed out 2020. First, our variable income streams will recover. Over the next 24 months, Boston Properties will likely enjoy one of its most significant and predictable improvements in economic conditions and leasing activity as we witness the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. Two vaccines with high efficacy rates have been FDA-approved, 5.8% of Americans have already received at least one dose of the vaccine, the more easily refrigerated Johnson & Johnson vaccine is near approval, and health authorities are advising that anyone who wants to be vaccinated will be accommodated by this summer. The Biden administration is aggressively pursuing a more rapid vaccine roll out as well as economic stimulus to help bridge the economic damage caused by the pandemic. Given the herd immunity created by a high percentage of the population either recovered from infection and/or vaccinated, infections will likely drop precipitously in the middle of the year. We are all anxious to come out of isolation and return to our normal lives. So as the infection rate drops, the economy will reopen and individuals will return to offices, restaurants, shops, theaters, and travel. Approximately $97 million of Boston Properties\u2019 FFO decrease in 2020 came from the variable income streams of parking, our single hotel, and retail customers, all of which were devastated by the lockdowns, and we will likely see a strong recovery in these variable income streams in the near term as the economy reopens. Second, Boston Properties' office portfolio is stable. We have been collecting through the pandemic over 99% of our office rents owed, demonstrating the quality of our buildings and office tenants. Only 7.1% of our leases rolled over this year, and we experienced 20% roll-ups on average the last three years, providing a cushion for decreases in market rent caused by the pandemic. We have signed over 600,000 square feet of leases on currently vacant space that will experience rent commencement in 2021. We expect the non-cash charges experienced in 2020 for accrued rent balances to diminish, if not cease in 2021. We are now recognizing rent on a cash basis for all theater and co-working tenants as well as the vast majority of retail credits we consider at risk. We will also be delivering in whole or part three assets into service this year, 100 Causeway, 159 East 53rd Street, and 200 West Street just under 1 million square feet in aggregate and 95% leased. Third, Boston Properties has significant external growth drivers, which are readily quantifiable over the next four years. We currently have under development and redevelopment seven projects comprising 3.7 million square feet and $2.2 billion in total investment. These projects are 88% pre-leased, fully funded with cash on our balance sheet, and projected to generate cash yields on cost at stabilization of approximately 7%. In addition, we recently delivered three Class A urban apartment complexes in Boston, Reston, and Oakland with an aggregate of 1,350 units that are only 56% leased and have substantial income upside as the economy reopens. We expect the income from delivering this development pipeline to add 3.4% annually to our FFO growth over the next four years. We also anticipate starts this year of over $800 million, the majority of which are new life science developments and conversions. And lastly, we own or control land aggregating over 16 million square feet of potential office, lab, and residential development, which we will commence as dictated by market conditions. Now, my next points relate to our business model and strategy, a core strategic principle for Boston Properties is to build, acquire, and own high-quality buildings. Our portfolio is dominated by Class A urban assets, many among the leading buildings in their respective markets such as Salesforce Tower, the General Motors Building, 200 Clarendon Street, and Kendall Center. Higher quality buildings stay more occupied and perform better in times of recession as certain customers take advantage of lower rents to upgrade their space. For example, VTS reported from their database that tours for Class A buildings in New York City went from 38% of total before the pandemic to 54% during the pandemic. Another hallmark of our quality strategy is market selection as we believe in the long-term health and attractiveness of our coastal gateway markets. We acknowledge the economic damage to local businesses and city budgets the pandemic has brought as well as individual relocations to lower tax jurisdictions, but we remain confident in the attractiveness of our target markets for two basic reasons : the clustering of knowledge workers and increased barriers to new supply. The cities where we currently and aspire to operate; New York, San Francisco, Boston, Washington DC, Los Angeles, and Seattle, have unmatched educational, cultural, and civic resources which attract the leading clusters of knowledge workers in the U.S., particularly in computer science and life sciences. Knowledge workers have more job opportunities and are more productive when working with others in clustered environments. Future job growth and office demand is going to be driven in the technology and life science fields, where our target markets have a distinct clustering advantage. To create value in office real estate as an owner you need rental growth, which is driven by both job growth and barriers to supply. Our markets have built-in obstacles to new development, including a dearth of available sites, difficulty in permitting, anti-development local ordinances, and cost and complexity in construction. My last point on business model is Boston Properties\u2019 fully integrated operating capability and quality of execution. In 2020, we were able to lease 3.7 million square feet with a weighted average lease term of 8.6 years, which is around 60% of our recent annual leasing averages. While the leasing activity in our markets was approximately 40% of recent annual averages, in all our core cities we are a market-leading participant, providing advantages and accessing new investment opportunities, procurement, and attracting and retaining talent. We are an industry leader in ESG performance as measured by GRESB, the EPA, USGBC, ENERGY STAR, Fitwel, and others, and were recently recognized as the leading office company and second best property company in Newsweek's 2021 Most Responsible Companies ranking. My next points relate to valuation. Because of the pandemic and the variability in our parking, retail and hotel income streams, Boston Properties' FFO dropped approximately 15% the last three quarters of 2020 versus pre-pandemic levels, which is clearly disconnected from our stock price, which has dropped 37% over the same period. The gap is caused by expectations, specifically, concern about gateway markets addressed earlier, and the impact of work from home on office demand. I will reiterate that we think more remote work is here to stay after the pandemic, but concerns over the impact to office space demand are overblown. Business leaders want their employees back in the office to foster culture, collaboration, teamwork, and mentoring, and to provide more supervision. In a recent employee survey completed by Gensler, workers want to return to the office as well, where they believe they are most productive and collaborative, but 52% want a hybrid model with more time to work from home for convenience and safety from COVID-19, fears of which should dissipate over time. However, 90% of those employees surveyed want an assigned workstation when in the office, and while only 21% of those surveyed at a private office layout 47% wanted it. Though employees may be working remotely more in the future, it will be difficult for employers to translate lower census into space savings due to employees' desire for more privacy and a fixed workstation. There is also a disconnect between where the private real estate market is valuing Class A office assets in gateway markets and where the public market is valuing Boston Properties. At our current share price the look-through cap rate on our portfolio is 5.9%. High-quality office assets comparable to much of Boston Properties portfolio are trading at sub-5% cap rate. Though office transaction volumes were down materially in the last three quarters of 2020 from the prior year, activity improved each quarter as investors returned to the market. Volumes were down 45% in the fourth quarter versus the fourth quarter in 2019 but were up 59% sequentially from the third quarter. Office was no more out of favor then other asset classes after the pandemic as office transaction volume was 29% of total commercial real estate volume both in 2019 and the last there quarters of 2020. There continues to be a robust market for life science real estate, as well as quality office buildings in technology-driven markets with more limited leasing exposures. Just in life science - life science is a portfolio dominated by a leasehold interest in University Park in Cambridge sold for $3.4 billion, around $1,500 a square foot and a mid-4% cap rate with roll-up potential, and a partial interest in Discovery Park in Cambridge was sold for $720 million, representing $1,190 a square foot, and a 4.7% cap rate. And in office, 410 Tenth Avenue in New York City sold for $950 million, which equated to $1,490 a square foot, and a 4.5% cap rate, and 510 Townsend and 505 Brannan Streets in San Francisco sold for a combined $570 million, $1,280 a square foot and a 5% cap rate. Though both buildings are leased long term, one is being sub-let in full by its user. And in the Seattle CBD, a leasehold interest in 2+U sold for $700 million, $1,020 a square foot, and a 4.7% cap rate, and 1918 Eighth Avenue sold for $625 million, $940 a square foot, and also a 4.7% cap rate. There is material investment activity in like assets to Boston Properties. And with interest rates forecast to remain low and the economic recovery described earlier, we expect transaction activity to increase and cap rates potentially to tighten for well-leased assets. And lastly, Boston Properties has the balance sheet and access to capital to take advantage of opportunities that will present themselves as a result of the pandemic. We currently have $3.2 billion in liquidity and after the redemption of our unsecured bonds and fully funding our current development pipeline, we'll have $1.5 billion of liquidity remaining. We have been more actively monetizing in-service assets, having completed $570 million in gross sales in 2020, and we expect a similarly elevated level of activity this year. We have access and size at attractive terms to the unsecured debt market if needed and have been developing increasingly formalized relationships with large scale private equity partners to help us fund acquisitions. We have a reasonable pipeline of potential new opportunities in our core markets in Seattle and continue to look for investments that require leasing and/or redevelopment to take advantage of our operating skills and to create higher returns. As mentioned, we also intend to invest more aggressively into life science real estate and have 5.8 million square feet of new development and redevelopment projects under our control located primarily in the life science hubs of Cambridge, Waltham, and South San Francisco. So in conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to create a very challenging environment for many sectors of the U.S. economy and commercial real estate, including office assets. However, the end of the pandemic is approaching and we are confident Boston Properties will emerge with strength and momentum given our portfolio quality, income stability, growth potential, access to capital, and highly engaged management team. Doug, over to you. Doug Linde : Thanks Owen. I thought about just sort of stopping right there and starting the questions, but I guess I'll make some remarks and give some time for Mike as well. Good morning, everybody. As we sit here in January of 2021, we are shifting from COVID, COVID, COVID, as the obstacle to a pickup in activity to vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, as a signal to rejuvenate tenant conversations about bringing staff back to the office and starting the leasing transaction processes. There is no question that the rapid increase in COVID cases over the last six weeks of 2020 and the beginning of 2021 suppressed leasing tours and discussions during that period of time. But in the last two weeks, two large Boston companies have announced their expected return to work dates. We signed an LOI for a 70,000 square feet tenant that's going to need space in December 2021, and just yesterday, Amazon announced in Boston that they're committing to another 630,000 square feet to be built office building and bringing 3,000 additional jobs to the Boston CBD. So while the first half of 2021 is expected to be quiet, we are cautiously optimistic that we've been through the worst of the pandemic, and that the latter part of 2021 will have a discernible pickup in leasing transaction volume, parking revenue, and retail sales. The year-end market leasing reports that are published by the commercial brokerage organizations held few surprises as you probably heard through many of the analysts' calls. Leasing volumes were way off their historical pace and with the significant sublet space added to the market, we saw negative absorption and increased availability everywhere. It's important to remember that there are two types of sublet space. First, space that comes from users that have had changes in their employee headcount and are clearly no longer in need of all that space, and then, there is a second group, tenants that are being opportunistic, listing their entire premises by the way at no cost to them with an expectation that they'll decide what to do, if they get an acceptable actionable offer down the road. They may reoccupy it, they may relocate and transact or they may find a way to sublet a portion of their space. We just don't know. But based on all the conversations we have had with our technology, our life science, our professional service, our legal, our financial firms, as well as the leasing brokers that are responsible for these listings, a change in workplace strategy, a.k.a., we're going to work from home, or we're going to go to a disaggregated workforce. That's not what's driving the bulk of the sublet activity. One thing is sure, not all the sublet space is actually available. You might find the following illustrative of that. In Midtown, Manhattan, after the Great Recession, according to CBRE from 2008 to 2009, about 24 million square feet of space was put on the sublet market. Between 2009 and 2010, 13.6 million square feet, or 57% of that was withdrawn from the market. Not all space is available. The Boston Properties' office portfolio ended the year at 90.1% occupied. The quarterly sequential drop is entirely due to the addition of Dock 72 at 33% leased into the in-service portfolio. As Owen said, we have 600,000-plus square feet of signed leases, 134 basis points in our in-service portfolio that has not yet commenced revenue and hence is still defined as vacant, but it has been leased. We completed another 1.2 million square feet of leasing during the quarter. On a relative basis, my view of the ranking activity on our portfolio, active lease negotiations, tours, RFPs in our markets is as follows. Starting with the best and moving to the least. Boston, Waltham, by the way, we don't have any available space in Cambridge; Northern Virginia; Midtown Manhattan; Princeton; Los Angeles; the Peninsula Silicon Valley; DC and finally, the CBD of San Francisco. During the fourth quarter in the Boston CBD, we did five leases, including another full-floor new tenant at Atlantic Wharf. The cash starting rent on this full-floor lease will be 34% higher than the expiring rent and there are future rent increases. The cash rent on the other four leases had a weighted average increase of about 30%. We continue to have additional activity in our CBD Boston portfolio, albeit with a number of smaller tenants under 10,000 square feet. A few are looking for incremental growth and a few were considering letting their 2020 leases expire and are now actively engaged in short-term renewal conversations. I also want to note that we finally obtained possession of the 120,000 square foot two-stories former Lord & Taylor building on Boylston Street during the early part of this month. This was a big win, as we believe we can find a far more productive use for this box that has been under lease since the mid-1960s to Lord & Taylor. In our suburban Boston portfolio, we completed 226,000 square feets of new leasing, including all of the remaining space at 20 CityPoint first generation. This is in addition to the life science lease we did at 200 West Street. The cash rent on the second generation leases, about 150,000 square feet, was up an average of 23% on a cash basis. We continue to have additional activity in Suburban Boston. In Waltham, we're negotiating a 60,000 square foot lease extension, a lease with a new tenant for a 63,000 square foot block of space, and we're responding to a number of large life science lab requirements. At the moment, we don't have any ready to go vacant lab space, but we hope to begin our conversion of 880 Winter Street, 220,000 square feet, during the second quarter, and our 300,000 square foot 180 CityPoint lab building has been fully designed, fully permitted and we are simply waiting final construction bids over the next few months. Turning to Northern Virginia, this quarter we completed six renewals at our VA-95 single-story park totaling about 218,000 square feet. In addition to the VW commitment in Reston Next, we completed another 82,000 square feet in the Town Center in Reston. In total, in 2020, we completed 1.15 million square feet of leasing in Reston Town Center. We still have more work to do, but we have a good start to 2021 with lease negotiations ongoing for an additional 60,000 square foot block of space. In Reston Town Center, rents are basically flat to slightly down 1% to 2% on the relet since the expiring cash rents have been increasing contractually by 2.5% to 3% for the last 10 years and they will continue to do so on a going-forward basis. Our DC CBD exposure rests on our JV assets, but here too, activity in our portfolio has picked up. We completed 24,000 square feet of leasing during the quarter and we are negotiating over 120,000 square feet of leases as we speak. In New York City, we executed our lease with Asana at Times Square Tower for about 132,000 square feet of office space. We completed two floor deals in the New York City market, each 31,000 square feet at 601 Lex. One was a one-year extension and the second was a 10-year renewal and the cash rent decreased about 8% on that renewal. We also did four small transactions at 250 West 55th Street and Times Square Tower totaling 26,000 square feet. Three were short term and one was a 10-year deal. We're negotiating a full-floor transaction at 399 Park on a space that's not expiring until the end of 2021. While we didn't do much leasing in Princeton during the quarter, we have a number of active discussions ongoing and we believe tenants will be making decisions to expand or relocate in late '21, and are strongly considering Carnegie Center. When we talk about California, you need to appreciate the fact that the State has been strongly discouraging tenants from asking their employees to go to their offices for the last 11 months. The uncertainty level from the lack of pedestrian activity at the street plain, particularly in the CBD of San Francisco, has been more severe than anywhere else in our portfolio. And this has affected tenants appetite for making any decisions. Just to put this year in perspective, from 2017 to 2019, there were on average 14 tech company leases per year in excess of 100,000 square feet. In 2020, there were none. Our San Francisco assets are 95% leased and we have 280,000 square feet expiring in 2021. The third quarter produced just three transactions totaling about 23,000 square feet at EC, and during the fourth quarter, we did another four leases, all renewals, up about 18% on a cash basis, totaling 20,000 square feet. It's pretty slow there. In South San Francisco, our Gateway JV is planning the construction commencement of 751 Gateway, a 230,000 square feet ground-up lab development to begin over the next few months followed by the conversion of 651 Gateway, which will be a renovated building if we're able to relocate the existing tenant there. There is more activity in the Silicon Valley and Mountain View area than the rest of the Bay Area. Two technology companies did 200,000 square feet plus expansions during the quarter and there are three active requirements right now in the market in excess of 200,000 square feet. There continues to be a slow resurgence of medical device, alternative energy, automotive, the hardware side of technology that are all out looking for space. We are seeing a few of these organizations looking at our Mountain View, single-story product, which is plug and play ready. In Santa Clara, we're going to be taking our 218,000 square feet Peterson Way building out of service when the lease expires in the second quarter of '21. This was a covered land play and contributed about $4.8 million of revenue in 2020. We have entitlements for a 630,000 square feet campus permitted and approved ready to go. In spite of the challenging COVID related conditions in California, in Santa Monica, we continue our renewal negotiations with our 2021 expirations. And as I said at the outset, we signed a 70,000 square foot LOI at Colorado Center from a new tenant. You may recall earlier this year, we actually did an expansion with another technology company at the Santa Monica Business Park. I purposely didn't make any comments about market rents during my remarks. With very limited activity, any conjecture about where rents will settle out is pure opinion. What I can tell you is that there will be large differences between deals cut on sublet space and direct space. Sublet landlords will have less appetite for capital and more leeway with lowering face rents or giving free rent. There will be tenants, however, that simply don't want the risk of sublet space. Will that prime tenant actually pay their rent for the full-term, is that a risk worth taking? Or the as-is conditions and other issues associated with that may make them very uncomfortable with those risks. There will be a very wide gap between the bid and the ask on direct space at the outset until we have a meaningful amount of direct deal comparable transactions for the market to understand. Landlords with vacant space that are courting tenants that want a new installation will use capital to entice users to this space not necessarily face rents. And landlords working on renewals will be more aggressive with swing space where it can be made available or lower contractual rates if the installation that's there currently works for the user. However, there will be a flight to quality and to better buildings as tenants see value in paying less of a premium to be in the best assets in these markets. Conditions are going to vary submarket by submarket. I'm going to stop there and yield the rest of our time to Mike. Mike LaBelle : Excellent. Thanks, Doug. Good morning. So I'm going to cover the details of our earnings for the fourth quarter. I'll also explain our guidance for the first quarter that we provided and some insight into our expectations for the full year 2021. We've reinstated quarterly FFO guidance, which we hope will be helpful and serve as an indicator of our increased confidence in the operating environment. Our office tenant collections remain strong and we believe the write-offs are largely behind us. We also continue to execute on new and renewal office lease requirements as evidenced by the 1.2 million square feet of leasing in the fourth quarter and the 3.7 million square feet of leasing in 2020 overall despite the pandemic related shutdowns. We're encouraged by the roll out of the vaccine and are confident we will see a return of workers to the office in mass. But there remains uncertainty with respect to timing. We anticipate our ancillary revenues such as parking and retail will continue to be weak until the population increases. Once we have better visibility into the timing, we expect to restore full-year guidance as well. Our fourth quarter results contained two charges that I would like to explain. The first is a $60 million non-cash impairment of our equity investment in Dock 72, our 670,000 square feet development we put into service in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. This investment is held in an unconsolidated joint venture where we own 50%. Because the investment is unconsolidated, GAAP requires a mark-to-current fair value. Also, while the $0.35 per share charge is a deduction from net income, it is added back to arrive at FFO. So it has no impact on our reported FFO pursuant to NAREIT's definition. Dock 72 is only 33% leased as Doug said, and while we had some promising leasing activity pre-COVID, there is little activity today and the market conditions in Brooklyn have weakened. We have increased our projected cost to stabilize, as well as modified and extended our anticipated lease-up. And the combination of this has resulted in a lower current fair value for the property. The extension of timing to achieve stabilization has a meaningful impact on fair value. We see Dock 72 as a unique situation and we do not anticipate any additional impairments in the portfolio. The rest of our development pipeline is very well leased at 88%. Our in-service portfolio is over 90% leased and honestly, most of the assets have significant embedded gains. The second charge is a $38 million, or $0.22 per share, non-cash charge to net income and FFO for the write-off of all accrued rental income for tenants in the co-working industry. While these tenants are paying rent today, we believe the ongoing length of the pandemic is stressing the sector's revenue and liquidity. As such, we do not believe they meet the standard to maintain an accrued rent asset on our balance sheet. As we discussed in both our second and third quarter earnings calls, co-working is the remaining tenant sector that we've been monitoring closely. It is possible we could face a few individual credit situations this year due to the impact of the pandemic across the portfolio, but we don't anticipate additional significant accrued rent write-offs to other sectors of tenants like we've experienced with retail and with co-working in 2020. For the fourth quarter, our reported FFO was $1.37 per share. If you exclude the accrued rent charge, our fourth quarter FFO would have been $1.59 per share and in line with consensus and the expectations that we shared with you last quarter. Now, I'd like to look forward to 2021. We have provided first quarter 2021 guidance for FFO of $1.53 to $1.57 per share. At the mid-point this is $0.04 per share lower than our fourth quarter 2020 FFO before charges. The decline is entirely due to approximately $0.10 per share of seasonally higher anticipated G&A. The first quarter is always our highest quarter for G&A due to accounting for compensation. If you look back historically, we typically record 30% of our annual G&A expense in the first quarter. The increase in G&A expense is anticipated to be partially offset by higher revenue contribution from our portfolio, including the commencement of revenue for a portion of the signed leases that Doug described. We also expect lower interest expenses. We are redeeming our $850 million bond issuance in mid-February with cash on hand. These bonds have a yield of 4.3% and there will be no prepayment charge. We're currently earning close to zero on our cash. So we will see the full benefit of lower interest expense for the second half of this quarter and for the rest of 2021. So as we think about the full year 2021, there is a few things to consider. If you simply annualize the midpoint of our first quarter guidance, you get to about $6.20 per share. But that does not account for the seasonality of our G&A, the reduction of interest expense from our bond redemption, or the incremental impact of leased developments coming online during the year. For modeling purposes, we suggest you consider adding the following to the Q1 annualized FFO of $6.20 per share : $0.19 per share for the impact of lower G&A for the rest of the year; $0.08 per share from lower interest expense due to the bond redemption; and $0.05 per share of incremental FFO from new developments coming online, including 159 East 53rd Street, which is 96% leased to NYU, and where we expect to commence revenue in the second quarter; 100 Causeway Street in Boston, which is 94% leased, with projected revenue phasing in starting in the third quarter; and 200 West Street, our life science development in Waltham, which is a 100% leased and is projected to deliver in December. So adjusting our first quarter annualized run rate for these known items gets to approximately $6.52 per share for 2021. That said, we are not providing full-year guidance for FFO because there remains uncertainty in our variable income streams, including our ancillary income and our same-property leasing, both of which impact revenues and occupancy. The timing of recovery from the pandemic is still unknown. It could have a material impact on the recovery of revenues from our parking, retail, and hotel. Currently, these income streams are depressed. Their contribution is nearly $30 million lower on a quarterly basis than what we saw pre-pandemic. We are hopeful that a portion of this revenue will start to return in the back half of 2021, but the timing is really reliant on the success of the COVID vaccines and return to a safe and healthy environment in our cities. We also have lease expirations in 2021 that will impact our occupancy and same-property NOI. Our rollover for 2021 is 3.2 million square feet. As Doug described, we already have 610,000 square feet of leases signed that will take occupancy of currently vacant space this year. We're also actively working on over 1 million square feet of new leases and renewals across the portfolio. Overall, we expect our year-end 2021 occupancy to be flat to down 100 basis points compared to current occupancy. It's also worth noting that we have a meaningful amount of free rent that burned off in 2020 that will boost our cash same-property performance and AFFO in 2021. Specifically, at 399 Park Avenue, we had 450,000 square feet of space in build-out and under free rent for nine months in 2020 that is now in cash rent. And at the General Motors Building, 160,000 square feet of office space and a portion of our retail was under free rent for most of 2020, and are now paying cash rent. This showed up in our results in the fourth quarter with a $10 million increase in same-property cash NOI sequentially from Q3 to Q4. In summary, we're excited about the prospects for revenue and FFO growth. Our portfolio cash flow is expected to grow in 2021. The success of the vaccine programs should give rise to the recovery of our ancillary revenue streams. And we have $2.2 billion of leased developments coming online over the next couple of years, all of which should drive future earnings growth and value. That completes our formal remarks. If you could open the lines up for questions, operator, that would be great. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Nick Yulico : So I guess in terms of some of the pieces that you gave on 2021, it's helpful to think about. I guess maybe starting first on the point about occupancy being year-end flat to down 100 basis points, can you just maybe explain what that assumes in terms of actually getting retention rate on renewals versus some new leasing? Since I know you also said that you have already this embedded occupancy gain of, I think 130 basis points, just trying to kind of square away how we should think about how you then get to a flat or down 100 basis point number by the end of the year? Doug Linde : So, Nick, this is Doug. It's not as precise as you're going to want to hear, but our method of coming up with that number is to understand the amount of space that we have rolling over. And while we have a probability on renewals, the real variability is on how much of the vacant space that we currently have is going to : A, be leased; and B, be revenue-producing, because it has to be revenue-producing, meaning we have to have delivered it in \u201cas ready space\u201d or in second-generation and not demolished [ph]. And so that's what's really driving the number to sort of flat-to-negative because we just don't know what we're going to be asked to do relative to the delivery conditions of that space and when revenue is going to start. Again, we sit here today with 134 basis points of lease space that's not revenue recognizing right now, and we just don't know where we're going to be as we get to the end of the year. And honestly, we expect our transaction volume is going to pick up as the year goes on. It's going to be slow in the first half of the year and our expectation is if the vaccine rollout goes as we believe it will, there will be a significant pickup in that activity once people are back in school from a population perspective and people are back in their desks and people are feeling very confident about their business prospects. And so, the third and fourth quarters are going to be back weighted, which again impacts that revenue number. Nick Yulico : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Doug. I guess just one other question, twofold on 2021. And one, a decision not to provide guidance, maybe just hearing a little bit more about for the full year, why you thought it made sense to not provide guidance since you did, I think, you gave a lot of components that help us think about a potential range. And then I guess in terms of when you're talking about the 652 days, Mike, and then you talked about some uncertainty on variable income streams and same-property leasing, I guess since you did give a year-end sort of occupancy range, I guess I'm trying to just think about the same-property leasing and whether that ends up being a negative adjustment to that base on FFO that you talked about based on your year-end occupancy number? Mike LaBelle : So, I'll try to describe it a little bit more, and look we're trying to provide as much assistance as we can, but there are some variable pieces that are pretty big that would require a wide range, I would say. On the same store, every 50 basis points of occupancy based upon our current kind of rental rates is about $15 million. So that's $0.09 a share is every 50 basis points of occupancy. The variable income streams that I talked about could add $30 million a quarter. So we just don't know when that's going to come in. I think that the hotel portion of that, which is minor is only $5 million a quarter. We think it's going to take longer, but the parking and the retail components of that could snap back more quickly. It could be third quarter, it could be fourth quarter, and it's just really hard for us to say when that's going to happen, so providing a meaningful guidance range to you all is just difficult at this time, so we've chosen not to do that. But I think I've given you a sense just on these comments of what our expectation is. If our occupancy is going to go down - then after you pull out the charges we incurred in 2020 from the same-store and you just think about run rate, if our occupancy goes down by 50 basis points on average, I would expect our same-store to be down slightly. We look at these - our lease-up on a lease by lease basis, so we've looked at all of our units. Our renewal retention has gone up and you've seen it quarter-over-quarter during the pandemic, it was I think 56% 57%. This quarter, it was pretty good. So, we've done that analysis to come up with kind of the occupancy views that we have based upon the activity that we're seeing today in the portfolio. Hopefully, that's helpful. Doug Linde : Let me just say it in a slightly different way. We are really good at understanding what's going to happen in the portfolio in the next 90 days with regards to the variable income. We're really not good at knowing what's going to happen three and six months from now. We hope that when we get to our next conversation with you, which is in early May or late April, we're going to be in a better position to know how things are going across the country from a variable perspective, but we may not know. But I think we don't have the certainty associated with it and we just don't feel -- we can pontificate about the recovery of the base economy in terms of how people are going to act, and so that's why we're sticking with this quarter-by-quarter methodology right now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Derek Johnston : A big bright spot in leasing with demand being pretty firm for life science and biotech companies was certainly welcome. But it seems that C-suite decision making in FIRE and maybe to a lesser extent TAMI tenants is a bit more hesitant to a muted with commentary often including more work from home flexibility longer term. And obviously, people talk about the need potentially for less office space. What are you guys seeing in the field and when do you anticipate fire and TAMI tenants to reengage in a meaningful way? Will it be during 2021 or potentially pushed out a bit? Doug Linde : Owen, you want to be on the soapbox first? Owen Thomas : Sure. There are few things there to unpack. Look, I think that you're correct. The life science demand is strong. Some of the other sectors are not. I think the reason for that is most importantly, we're in a recession and in all recessions, leasing activity slows down, businesses have more uncertain outcomes and CEOs are less likely to make major financial commitments, which are leases. So this is no different from prior recessions. I think office lags a bit. So I think you're going to - we're probably not going to get more stronger leasing activity until later in the year when the virus dissipates, people come back to the office and the economy is clearly in improvement. As I said in my remarks, we acknowledge the impact of work-from-home and do believe that workers in America and possibly around the world, will want to work from home on a part-time basis more frequently. So we acknowledge that impact, but we also see with our - and we also see with CEOs I think the importance that they see in in-person work and their strong interest in getting their employees back to the office. So then the issue is, okay, what's the impact of the additional part-time work on office demand. And again, to save space by having - with people working at home on a part-time basis, you really need to do two things. You need to schedule when that time out of the office is because everybody can't be out of the office on Monday or Friday. And two, you have to go to flexible work stations and move people around. And again, if you're looking at employee preferences, one of them is, they want to work from home more and as I said in my remarks, 19% of the people surveyed in the Gensler survey said they wanted a fix workstations. So which employee preference will be accommodated. So again, we acknowledge there is an impact from work-from-home, but we think it's overblown for those reasons. Derek Johnston : Got it. No. Thank you. Appreciate. Appreciate the color. But let's just stick on that employee survey that you guys mentioned in the remarks. I mean, I'd say to play devil's advocate just because of worker wants an office or a dedicated workspace, does not mean that they will be granted that, especially if they prefer or demand a hybrid model. So hot desking seems to us a potential solution especially in an A, B or a week on, week off model, that allows deep cleaning over the weekend. So I guess like what data from business leader conversations lead you to believe that hot desking is ultimately unlikely? Thank you, guys. Owen Thomas : Yes. Look, I think you have to say - I mean, look, we all as employers want to accommodate our talented workforces, and that survey expressed employee preference. So I think business leaders across the country are going to have to sort out which employee preferences they want to try to accommodate. I talked about the fixed workstation. Working from home more is also an employee preference. I do think strongly in talking with other business leaders there is a strong interest in having employees return to the office because of all of the diminution that's going on in terms of culture, competitiveness, creativity, onboarding employees. So again I think this is a question that business leaders are going to have to sort out, which employee preferences are they going to try to accommodate. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. Anthony Paolone : Thank you, Doug. You mentioned it's hard to know where rents are going to ultimately shake out, but you did do a lot of leasing in the quarter, and it sounds like you've got a pipeline. Where would you peg kind of the conversations around all-in economics now versus pre-COVID? Doug Linde : I think it depends. Anthony, it depends on the market. And I mean I will tell you that we are getting higher rents in our life science oriented in our suburban portfolio in Boston right now than we were pre-COVID. And in a market like San Francisco, all we've done is renewals and all those renewals have been well in excess of what the current tenants are paying and it's unclear if rents have really dropped by much. But I can tell you that in my heart of hearts, I do believe that we're going to see some softness in the markets that we're in. So again, I wish I could give you a firm answer, but I just can't. Now, if you ask 100 people right now based upon the activity that's occurred in these cities, are rents up or down by more or less 10%, I would say, they would tell you that rents are down by less than 10%, but again it's a net effective calculation, not a base rate versus a face rate previously. Anthony Paolone : I mean given the rollover in 2021, I think you have a decent amount of Boston. Is it just do you anticipate that you'll likely have positive spreads across the portfolio this year when it's all said and done? Doug Linde : The answer is, I think the answer will be, yes, I mean that's why I gave all that data on all the leases that we've done recently. Again that's about what the rent was versus what the rent will be on a contractual basis. Not about would the rents have been higher, had we done the deal six months ago? So I mean that's an affirmative, yes. Anthony Paolone : And then just a question on the capital allocation side. Just curious how do you think about or how do you weigh kind of the JV route as an acquisition vehicle versus the complexity it adds to the Company overall versus say just selling assets to raise capital? And then in terms of target markets, is Seattle the only target that you're not in or are there any others out there? Owen Thomas : So I'll touch on that. We do have significant capital, but we also have significant ambition in terms of growing the Company and making new investments that makes sense for shareholders. So we do think it makes sense to extend the equity capital we have with partners. We have a rich tradition of doing this in the Company. We have a reasonably significant portfolio that's already partnered with global leading real estate investors like Norges and CPP, and we think extending that type of business Makes a lot of sense. Selling assets is not an efficient way for us to raise capital. Most, if not all of our major assets, have a significant tax gain, which requires a cash or it requires a special dividend. And therefore, the retention of capital is much lower. So for all those reasons, we think the joint ventures makes sense. And the other thing I would say on the JVs is, we are providing property services to those joint ventures. So we do enhance our yields as a result of providing those services to the joint venture partners. Anthony Paolone : Thanks. And then the Seattle piece of it? Doug Linde : Sorry. So yes, I would say in terms of new markets where we currently are not in operation, Seattle is the only market that we are actively looking at investments right now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi. Manny Korchman : Mike in terms of the co-working exposure, can you just remind everyone where you're concentrated geographically from a co-working perspective? And is it the lockdowns in those markets that are causing you to sort of take down those accruals and pause on that income stream? Doug Linde : So this is Doug, Manny. Let me, let me try and answer that question. So we've basically been approached by every operator in our portfolio regardless of the market about relief and we saw Regus this last quarter all over the country put units into bankruptcy. So we're now 11 months into this pandemic and it's pretty clear that the flexible space operators' customers, obviously, many of which had short-term leases and many of those leases are probably expired they've been very slow to come back to work. But it certainly not dissimilar from the census we've seen. In our census as we said before is somewhere in the high single digits to the low-double digits, right. So this industry is simply just facing revenue challenges and we decided that given the credit deterioration we should be recognizing rent on a cash basis. So that was our, that was the reason we do what we did when we did it. And with regard to our own portfolio, we have I think 13 units across the country, three in California, the rest in other portfolio - in Washington DC and in Boston, nothing in New York, we have one in New Jersey. And in total, it's about $50 million. And we've actually reduced our exposure by about 100,000 square feet over the last year with two leases that have expired. So we don't have any specific concerns about any particular unit. We're current on everything right now, but we just looked at the world and said, these guys are going to have a really rough time and we think based upon the credit deterioration, this is the time to do what we did. Manny Korchman : Thanks for that. And then, as you are going through discussions with some of the longer-term new leases, have you seen them either thinking about are actually changing their physical plan, more space, less space, that hoteling concept we've discussed on this call is sort of just more topical trends, but as they build out their space with 10 or 15-year leases, how are they building that out today? Doug Linde : So we have had this conversation in past calls. And I would wish I could tell you that there has been a sudden change in the sort of view that the tenants and their architects have taken, but I can tell you that very few tenants are really looking at transformational design changes in their spaces across all industry types. Now, that doesn't mean anecdotally that you won't find a customer that says, you know what, we are going to try and do this work-from-home workforce strategy, but we want all of our people to be able to come to the office and therefore, we're going to need different types of larger meeting rooms and different types of breakout areas and far less, individual spaces. There are people talking about that, but it's the exception, not the rule to date. And for the most part in all of the build-outs, we are seeing in our portfolio right now, it's business as usual pre-pandemic. And again the tenants that are in place with longer-term leases have yet to do anything with their spaces relative to making a change in the way it's currently configured because they have a unique way of looking at how they're going to come out of the pandemic relative to their utilization of space. I'm a little surprised, but that's the fact. We just haven't seen it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Jamie Feldman : I was hoping to dig into some of the markets in a little more detail. I guess, just starting out on DC post-election, and Democrats doing well and the budget we've seen. Any thoughts on what might change in either CBD are in Northern Virginia? Owen Thomas : So Ray and Peter, you want to take that one? Peter Johnston : Yes. I'll start. Owen Thomas : Go ahead, Peter. Go ahead and talk. Peter Johnston : Well, I was just going to say, having not been here as long as Ray, but since the late '80s, typically, when there is a line, Houses and Congress and the administration, and certainly I think we're seeing it now with the talk of the stimulus, it always positively impacts the real estate market. How that's going to occur and where that money gets spent? I certainly think that life science are going to benefit, which would indicate, the 270 Quarter and around NIH, closer in. But also downtown and there's talk about reenergizing the FBI. So historically, it's been a positive. It's just, given where we are with the pandemic, it's probably a little more difficult to predict right now. Ray Ritchey : I will just add to that. And this is more to Manny's point previously and yours Jamie, but in DC, relative to the four major tenants that we're constructing new headquarters for, Volkswagen, Wilmar, Marriott and Fannie, we're seeing virtually no change to the pre-pandemic space configurations that they were launching prior to the work from home motivation. And I think everybody - all four of those are extremely excited about getting their employees back to work. They're making virtually no plans for major downturn in the actual demand for space and they are quite excited about the new buildings we're building. So in the suburbs, we just completed perhaps one of the most successful years in Northern Virginia we've had in 20 or 30 years. So if there is a pandemic impact to our suburban portfolio, we're sure as hell not seeing it. Jamie Feldman : And then what is the leasing pipeline look like for more Reston Town Center type product? Ray Ritchey : So specifically in Reston, we've got probably another 200,000 square feet, 250,000 square feet proposals out for occupancy this year. And now we're running - in Reston, we are running up against the lack of available space. So we still have got about 150,000 square feet coming on with our new project RTC Next. That is now coming to a point in a physical condition where we start showing the space. So we think that the real activity in DC will continue to be suburban focused with some hopefully Biden related activity downtown. Jamie Feldman : And then I guess, shifting gears to the Bay Area. I mean we all see the headlines about corporate relocation activity. I'm just curious to hear as you think about the next couple of years, how much of a drag you think that will really have on market conditions? Doug Linde : Bob, you want to start with that? Bob Pester : Yes. Corporations move from the Bay Area and this happens every time there is a recession. Oracle was not a big occupier of new space or someone that was taking space consistently over the last couple of years. So I think it has very little impact. In the case of HP, they've been shedding space over the last 10 years. So I think again it has very little impact. Doug Linde : So Jamie, my additional response would be that, the profitability, the revenue picture, the aspirations of the technology companies that have significant footprints in the Greater San Francisco and Silicon Valley have probably been - are stronger now than they have ever been. And as I said to you before in my prepared remarks, it's been a really tough time in San Francisco in particular because of the shelter in place orders that moved to basically asking people not to go to work if they can't help it, but being able to go if they could. And we're just waiting to see what happens with regards to the aspirations of these technology companies relative to understanding that there is a heck of a lot of additional labor available because of the recession and certain things that happened earlier in the year, that residential rents have come down, so affordability has very significantly changed. And let's say, this is still going to be a great city and that there are opportunities to expand there. And it very well may be that we are surprised on the upside. We just don't know. And there is an incredible amount of beta associated with what will happen in San Francisco. And I think everyone right now is looking at the worst and assuming that's what the facts on the Street are going to be and not looking at the opportunity side. Jamie Feldman : Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks for every one's thoughts. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. I guess first, Owen, I just wanted to go back to the $800 million in I guess projected development starts or potential development starts. I guess a lot of that is probably life science, but just have you changed your pre-leasing hurdles? Have you changed your yield targets and what are you expecting on those projects to the extent you do start them? Doug Linde : Yes. Steve, on the life science, right now, given the heat in the market and the success that we had with 200 West Street and the dialog that we're having with customers, we would be prepared to launch speculative development and redevelopment in our core Life Science clusters. Maybe some of these dialogs with customers will be signed before we start, but we have a lot of confidence in the market. The yield requirements have not come down, so we're still shooting for 7%. And we would be a lot more - we will and are a lot more cautious with office. So pure office development, we certainly wouldn't launch without a pre-lease. Steve Sakwa : Okay. And then I guess you mentioned sales might be at similar level. It sounds like maybe $500 million, $600 million. Do you have any sense for kind of markets or how are you thinking about yields? How do you think yields would stack up? And are these sort of single-tenant, high credit deals with long lease terms that have sort of been the flavor of the day in the market, or are these more traditional multi-tenant, say, average lease terms, which really have not cleared the market? How do we think about those sales? Owen Thomas : Yes. Well, we are already working on a couple and we are sorting out the remaining assets that we want to sell this year. As we've discussed in the past, we do have these gains that come from the asset sales, but we are keeping our dividend flat and we have more suppressed income. So those gains will be used to pay the, regular dividend. And Steve, I think the assets we will select will be a mix. There'll be assets that we consider non-core. As you know, we've been selling $200 million $400 million of those per year even before the pandemic. And then, there'll be other assets that we think will meet the market in terms of some of that comparables that I described earlier and the cap rates that are being achieved. So I think it'll be a mix. Steve Sakwa : And then, Mike, I guess you gave it up, I guess, a reasonable number for earnings in '21. It sounds like that doesn't per se contemplate the potential occupancy decline that you and Doug spoke about, but nor does it contemplate on the plus side some of those tenants that are currently in place that are maybe on cash accounting, where you're not really collecting a lot of rent or maybe rent at all. So how do we think about those two kind of going in opposite directions and info between that $6.50 number? Mike LaBelle : Well, I think that the occupancy impact I mentioned in 2021, if it's 50 basis points, it could be $0.09. And on the ancillary income side, I talked about $30 million a quarter which is significantly more than that. And if you think about it, basically $12 million is parking, $12 million is retail, some of which is vacated, but some of which is just not paying us right now, and $5 million is hotel, which again might take a little bit further to get back. So depending on the timing of when that stuff comes back, it could clearly outstrip any kind of reduction we might have in occupancy from the same store. We do have - I think, what you're getting at, we had some tenants that are on abatements right now. They are actually in occupancy. So we had $19 million this quarter of those tenants. So we think that those tenants who are in occupancy and open, will start paying rent again. Some of those were recognizing GAAP rent right now, some of them were not, it's probably about 50-50 on that. So those tenants are in place and in occupancy, and we're hoping to get back to more of a contract rent basis next year as part of that overall $30 million increase? Steve Sakwa : Right. So not to put words in your mouth, but sounds like those things have the potential to maybe outstrip or outweigh the potential occupancy decline as some of those really start to move in a positive direction? Mike LaBelle : Yes. They certainly do and especially, when you get into 2022, when things are expected to even normalize further because there you're going to have both, starting to get more towards a full run rate on some of the stuff that returns hopefully, and you're going to have more development coming online as well because in 2022, we delivering Fannie Mae, we're delivering Google, and we got a lot of deliveries going on and the development growth for 2021 that I described is really pretty modest. I'd say, it's only $0.05. So last thing is that stuff is kind of coming in later in the year and we'll have a full year of that stuff in 2022. So I think, there is a lot - again, there's a lot of positive things that we've got going on. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks for taking the questions. So maybe just - so two questions. First, just on the sublease market, interesting you mentioned at least some tenants are sort of testing out the market and putting everything on the sublease market, just hoping to see what sticks, but I'm just curious from your perspective why is that occurring this cycle and why is - versus sort of prior cycles where we may not have seen that phenomenon? Doug Linde : We have seen in other cycles and other and other - which also was my point with regards to New York City between 2008 and 2009, right. I mean there was 24 million square feet that was put on and 13.7 million that was taken off. It was exactly the same thing. There is nothing different about this cycle relative to sublet space than the last cycle other than the fact that for the last 11 months, there has been no traction from an absorption perspective because most people have not been transacting particularly with the kind of spaces that are on the sublet market, which are a lot of times short term and are as-is in many cases because they don't know when they're going to need the space because they are not sure when their politicians are going to give them the okay to have their public schools open and therefore, the employees can feel comfortable making plans to go back to the space even if the buildings are open. Vikram Malhotra : So last cycle there were also just corporates who just put the entire space on the sublease space just to kind of see what sticks. But then as you say, some of it just - they took it back as the economy improved. That's interesting. Maybe just second. You referenced sort of the implied cap rate at a 5.9% for BXP and the private market in sub-5% range. I guess just if I look at pre-pandemic and the last five years, for whatever reasons, the equity markets have always sort of trade - versus NAV, the equity markets afforded call it a 20% discount or so plus to NAV over the last five years. And I'm just wondering from BXP's perspective either actions you take or we ways to exhibit value, post-pandemic assuming this kind of disconnect persists, what are some of the other actions or strategy you could pursue to close this gap? Owen Thomas : Vikram. I think the key is to grow the Company. I think the market values growth more than NAV and that's what we're focused on. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Alexander Goldfarb : Good morning up there or down there. So question first, Owen, you mentioned back on Seattle that that's the only market that you guys are looking at, but clearly, you see a lot more growth in places like Austin or Miami. I mean you've got Blackstone looking at buying a building down in Miami. So as worker preferences change and certainly Florida looks to become Wall Street of the South and Texas gets a lot more tech, at what point do some of those markets start to create the same dynamics, culture, knowledge base, et cetera, that would attract you guys to start looking at markets like an Austin or Miami, et cetera? Owen Thomas : Yes. So Alex, couple of things I would say. One, we acknowledge that there is some corporate relocation activity going on to South and most recently to South Florida and to Austin. So I would say couple of things. One, I think you got to dig into that a little bit more. I mean, I'm not sure I would describe South Florida as Wall Street South. I think if you actually looked at the size of the requirements that some of these larger financial institutions have in the Miami market, they are not that big. So it makes a big headline, but it's not a lot of space and it's not a lot of employees. So that's one. And then, two, look. I do - I think we all acknowledge Austin is a computer science cluster. There is no doubt about it, but the - and this is true in South Florida as well. The market dynamics for office investment are very different. The level of new construction and existing vacancy even with Class A space is very high and it's much more elevated than the markets that we operate in. So yes, you've got the growth, but you've also got plenty of supply coming on and that has an impact on outcomes as a real estate investor. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then the second question on the dividend. Mike, if we use your implied FFO range and then deduct for all the fun stuff to get us to AFFO, it would suggest that the dividend is going to be meaningfully uncovered this year. Owen, I think you'd probably agree that no one buys BXP necessarily for the dividend. They buy it for the overall growth, especially given the low dividend yield relative to other companies. So at what point does a dividend reduction become something that Board will contemplate, especially as you guys talk about all the development potential life science where the value creation in your platform is pretty good? At what point does the dividend come under reconsideration? Owen Thomas : Look, our goal is to have a stable and growing dividend. And given all the growth that Doug and Mike and I described on this call, we're going to grow back into our existing dividend in our opinion. Doug Linde : I mean, Alex, just step back. I mean, Mike said it I thought pretty well, which is, there is $30 million of quarterly revenue that is not in our numbers right now that we - absolutely it is coming back. Whether it comes back in the fourth quarter of 2021 or the third quarter of 2022, we don't know. But it's absolutely coming back and we have additional development that's coming online that's going to bring significant amounts of income. We have real confidence in the growth in our taxable income, in our FFO, in our AFFO over the next three to five years, including 2022, and again, we hope in late 2021. So I mean we're confident about what we have going on and our ability to increase our revenues in a significant way. Mike LaBelle : Just the other thing I would add to the question is, our FAD ratio is 105%. I wouldn't consider that meaningfully uncovered and we anticipate that our cash flows and our AFFO are going to improve next year and that's without necessarily the improvement of this ancillary income which would improve it even further. I mentioned the sequential quarter improvement in the cash flow on the same-store. And there's a lot of free rent that burned off in 2020, that is going to be there in 2021. So I agree with my colleagues that we're not thinking about resizing our dividend at this time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lewis with Truist Securities. Michael Lewis : It looks like your tenant retention for 2020 averaged about 45%. Correct me, if I'm wrong, but my real question is about the tenants that are not renewing and where they're going. Are they finding sublease space or maybe some cutting or eliminating their physical footprint or some moving to other markets? So I guess the question is, are there any trends you're picking up on that front, on the tenants that are moving out that are clearly different from pre-pandemic? Doug Linde : Michael, this is Doug. I don't think there's anything that we can point to that would be a trend that we would be either encouraged by or discouraged by. It's the natural move out of tenants based upon the age of their space, the way it was configured, and what their future plans are. And so we don't expect to see much in the way of changes in the profile of the kind of tenants that will stay versus the kind of tenants that will depart for whatever reason. Michael Lewis : And how many tenants have notified you of a return date to the office? In other words, do you have a rough schedule of how repopulation of your portfolio is likely to trend in the second half? And where the physical occupancy might be at the end of this year? Doug Linde : So the answer is, nobody has notified us as the landlord. What we know is that they are having conversations internally and talking about dates that are beginning in the end of the second quarter, early third quarter, and going as far into the year as the fourth quarter, depending upon the particular company and the particular location. But I would say that certainty around knowing that there will be a date and that date is sooner rather than later is the change that has occurred over the past couple of weeks. And I guarantee you that if the vaccine roll out is effective and working, that you will see more and more companies having the confidence to tell their employees that they expect those kids to be back in their seats in those schools and getting on the buses come the fall of 2021. And the colleges will be back in session in person and there will be athletic events and things like that, and it's going to be a question of simply getting through the scar tissue damage that's occurred over the last 11 months in terms of how quickly they ask those people to come back. Michael Lewis : And then, I'll just squeeze in one more if I can. I just want to confirm, the active development portfolio is 88% pre-leased. Are there any tenants in there that want to renegotiate anything or maybe wish they had done their plans a little different, maybe like sublease a space that could come back or any unusual risk that you see in any of those projects? Doug Linde : Definitively no to all of those questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Mizuho Securities. And your line is open sir. Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Ismail with Green Street. Daniel Ismail : I'm just curious regarding co-working does this experience change your thinking on how leases with these tenants might be structured in the future such as the revenue-share agreements/ Doug Linde : Yes. I think it absolutely does. I think it makes it clear that we don't have a lot of appetite for doing these leases with other people on a going-forward basis relative to what our current exposure is. And that - and when we do this stuff with this space in the future, it will be strategic and will have explicit needs in specific buildings and we'll probably look to do more of it ourselves because, therefore we're sharing revenue with ourselves. Daniel Ismail : And then on life science, we've seen life science cap rates trade inside of Class A office cap rates across your market footprint. But I'm curious, in your underwriting are you considering this as a permanent change in valuation or does this revert to a more historical range post-COVID? Owen Thomas : I think a lot of it's driven by the fact that life science rents in a lot of the markets where we operate have gone up a lot over the last few years. So when you look at an existing asset, there is a big roll-up in it from where the building is rack rented to where the market is, and that's creating lower cap rates. If that dynamic changes, I think the cap rates could go back up. Doug Linde : And there is a scarcity factor associated with it. There's is not that much of it anywhere in any particular market in the country and Owen likes to use the word, it's the hot dot. There is lots of institutional capital that's saying, we don't have any of that stuff. We need to get some. And so supply and demand, right, there is relatively little in the way of supply, there is lots of capital that is looking for it. And so at the moment, there is a very, very strong bid for. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : I just had a couple of follow-ups. The leases that you signed this quarter had eight-year term, but what is your appetite to offer shorter-term leases to build up occupancy? Doug Linde : So we are in the business of leasing space, John, and if a tenant wants a short-term lease, we will transact on a short-term basis. If a tenant wants a long-term lease, we will transact on a long-term basis. We are customer-centric and we want to do what our customers want to do. Owen Thomas : Yes. And don't forget that again, we've been - we've had a lot of success I think as you're pointing out in doing long leases. If we do the short extensions that Doug is talking about, generally those don't have CapEx. So we are in essence extending the tenant work over a longer lease term, which is also attractive. John Kim : So do you view that as a short-term solution given where we are in the economic cycle, or could this be a longer-term trend of shorter leases, lower CapEx? Owen Thomas : I think that you have different kinds of customers with different kind of motivations. I mean there are lots of customers who are going to say, we think there has been a correction in the market and this is an opportunistic time for us to do a very long-term lease. Those customers are going to want to get as much capital out of the landlord world as they possibly can and extend for as long as they think it's appropriate. So that's 15 to 20 years in some cases, I think there is another group of tenants that's saying, we're unsure, we're not - it's not clear to us how our business is going to perform relative to our current workforce strategy. We just want to kick the can for 18 months or two years, and then, look at it again when we'll have more clarity and more confidence about our decision and then we'll be able to make a more permanent capital decision. I think that's always going on and I don't think things are going to change dramatically, other than, I think it's going to be a slow ramp-up this year just due to, again, the way I referred to it, the scar tissue associated with the length of the time people have not been back together in their offices, and it's just going to change their decision-making framework. John Kim : And then, Mike, I just wanted to clarify with you. Do you see the fourth quarter as being the peak quarter in terms of what you've offered in rent deferrals and abatements? It sounds like you think some tenants are going to start paying rents again, but I'm wondering if you're going to be offering more rent relief as well during the year? Mike LaBelle : We certainly hope so. I mean I will say that many of our restaurant tenants we're kind of going through the summer because that's when we kind of have an expectation that it will be the next period of time when maybe there'll be improvement. So there is additional dollars that will occur over the next couple of quarters. Based on what we know today, it's not going to be $19 million because there is about - of the $19 million of those tenants I think there is about 10 left during 2021. And we are not - I guess you can never say never whether tenants are going to come to you again, but at this point, we've taken care of a lot of those tenants. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Abraham with Jefferies. Peter Abraham : I just wanted to go back to Owen's comments at the beginning. I think the words you used were, the most significant and predictable improvement conditions in leasing activity, which I think makes sense coming off the base we had in the second and third quarter. But at the same time, we're still coming out of a recession and a lot of office-using jobs have been lost. So I'm just curious how your outlook - where your outlook kind of contemplates for returning the job growth and how that impacts your thinking for '21 and '22? Owen Thomas : Yes. No. Look I chose those words carefully and I think - and maybe the interesting one was predictable. And I guess the difference of this cycle is, it's been less - it's not been driven by a cyclical move in the economy. It's been driven by a pandemic and a health crisis. And so with the vaccine progress, I think we see and I think the world sees a pretty obvious correction in this over the next six months. Again, knock on wood, maybe something goes wrong with the vaccines, or there is a slower roll out or there is something that goes on, but in essence unlike an economic recovery, which perhaps is harder to predict, again, if this is all about vaccinations maybe this one is easier to predict. And I think as all of us come out of the isolation that we're getting really tired of and return to the world and to our offices and to restaurant and to theater and to each other, the economy is going to reopen and I think jobs are going to come back. I think of all the small businesses that will get to reopen and restart as part of all this. So we do think, this year, we're going to have a significant improvement in economic activity. Look office leasing tends to lag that. So we do think by the later quarters of this year, that the office activity will also elevate as a result. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi. Michael Bilerman : It's Michael Bilerman here with Manny. So I wanted to sort of talk on two topics. One, just coming off the vaccine, I wondered, Doug, are you thinking about I guess requirements : A, just Boston Properties employees in terms of vaccinations, any contractors, building staff, in terms of making your assets competitive for tenants to feel comfortable they are coming into safe environment. And I know you can't force your tenants, but just how are you sort of thinking about vaccine roll out and how it adheres to your public places? Owen Thomas : Doug, you want to hit that? Doug Linde : Yes. So Michael, I'll give you an undiscussed response to that. So we have the view, I think, that in our particular marketplaces, the vast majority of the people who are tenants in our buildings will get the vaccine. And it's hard to go from there to a rigorous requirement that people get the vaccine, but it's not something that we won't talk about understanding what the ramifications of that are, but if the vaccine is effective and the vast majority of the people get it, the vaccine will have done its duty, which is to effectively eradicate the virus and we won't have to really worry about the issue on a going-forward basis, but it's not something that we haven't not thought about. Michael Bilerman : And then, Doug, you talked a little bit about the sublease space and giving the '09, '10 analogy for New York. The similarity is that we do have an economic crisis that's going on, but there is a big difference between the GFC and today, where people are not in their offices, right. People were still going to their offices in the GFC and people are not today. You've a lot more discussions with them, the corporations around the U.S., you certainly have a significant amount of discussions about full remote working and hybrid remote working. And aren't you going to love being in the office and I love the interactions that provides and the advancement in a lot of things, but what gives you the confidence that sublease space won't have a more material impact because it doesn't feel like it's all opportunistic? It feels as though it is much more real today as people think about the amount of square footage that they need in this new environment? Doug Linde : I think you're asking a lot of fair questions and the answers are unknown at the moment. I guess our intuition is that as people start to go back to work, the fear of missing out and all of the opportunities that in-person work have will become more clear to more people, and they will start to get back on the bandwagon. Again, I am not saying that there won't be much more flexibility in the way employers treat their employees relative to requirements to be in that seat every single day of the week. But I guess I am a strong believer and Owen and I have talked to lots of people about the nature of the office from both a business and from a social capital perspective, and how critical it is for the growth of businesses and the growth of the individuals that are in those businesses. And so I guess I'm more optimistic than your questions are suggesting about the value that people will ultimately and clearly see in having people going back to work in a very significant way. Again, on the margin, is it going to be a headwind? Absolutely. But I don't think it's going to be the radical disruptor that is certainly baked into I think the value of CBD office stocks. Michael Bilerman : Right. And I'm not trying to be a complete pessimistic person. I'm just trying to balance sort of the comment about looking at '09 and '10, and the sublease space coming back, feels different than where we sit today, but I understand sort of the points that you're making. How do you think... Doug Linde : Let me just give you two real-life examples of sublet space. Okay. So Mizuho which moved into a new installation on Fifth Avenue was always planning on putting their space on the sublet market. Okay. I don't think that sublet space is going to be competitive any longer because of other spaces on the market. So is it available? Yes. Is it going to be a sublet space, it's going to be actionable? I don't know. I think if you ask the people from BlackRock, I don't know if they have put them space on the sublet market, they had planned to put space on the sublet market because they took additional space when they were doing their lease and they always had the expectation that they would have some short-term sublet space. So there is a lot of that stuff that's there this time as well that people are all looking at it and saying, oh, it must be a change in philosophy for the workforce management of that organization and they're going to have more people working from home. I just don't think that there is as much of that as people think there is in the marketplaces. Sure, you can look at Dropbox and what Dropbox has decided to do in San Francisco. But we just saw Amazon take 600,000 square feet of new space in Boston. We saw Facebook last quarter take the REI building in Seattle. There are tenants on either side of the table doing contrary things at the same time. So again, I think it's very hard to make a directional conclusion. Michael Bilerman : What do you think the cadence is of the return to the office right? And a corporation today if they made the decision in March to say, hey, we're going to come back, I would assume there is a pretty long delay and amount of time that they have to give people given that a lot of people may have moved, they are in different places, maybe at that time when the workforce called them back and they say, what, I like being here, I'm going to go get a different job or go somewhere else. How do you think that cadence in your markets in terms of corporations making decision, and then, ultimately when their workers really come back into the office? Doug Linde : Owen, you want to take that one? Owen Thomas : Yes. Sure. Look, I think the key - our premise on this that we've described a couple of times this morning is, employers want their employees back in-person work. They believe their companies will be more successful If that's going on, but I don't think they're going to push it until the environment is safe. And therefore, the infection rate needs to drop precipitously from where it is now. And I think it will, as more people get vaccinated and more people are immune because they've recovered from infections. So when I think it's deemed to be safe, I do think then companies are going to be faced with the dilemma, Michael, that you described, which is, okay, we want people back and how hard we going to push it because our employee base. Some of these employees do like the work from home and they want to be out of the office. I don't think they want to be out of the office full-time, but they certainly want to be out of the office more. So these employers are going to have to decide what are we comfortable with, what do we need to do to be competitive in our industry in terms of in-person work and what kind of policies should we put up to balance this competitiveness issue, with the retention of talent. And I think each company is going to make those decisions differently. But again, I think as the infection rate goes down and my assumption is that will be over this summer, I do think you'll see a lot more companies requiring employees to come back to work. And I think different companies will have different policies around work from home. Owen Thomas : And I would like to say, Michael, that if an employee - if a human being is vaccinated and that human being is going to a restaurant to eat, they have basically said, okay. The stigma of being in the population is now over. And so as we see more and more of those types of things occurring, it's going to be quite clear that the difficulties associated with asking your employees to come back to work are going to have dissipated because they are going to have demonstrated that they are comfortable being in and around other human beings in a very close approximate way. If you're a believer in the efficacy of the vaccine and the vaccine does what it really is designed to do, which is you don't get sick if you are in contact with the virus. I think there is going to be a stronger desire for people to come back. Again once we solved those other issues, which are, we've now put people in a position where their children are going back to school, where they are comfortable going on public transportation, were all of the things that have been impediments to at least intellectually people coming to work and we have a governmental programmatic desire to get people back in seats, right, as opposed to saying, we think that people should remain as far apart as possible, because we're trying to keep this pandemic in containment, which is where we are and have been for the last 11 months. Michael Bilerman : Right. I was just trying to think through the timing of the corporate deciding, okay, it's now safe, we can do it, and then, asking their employees just not like - it can make a decision on Friday, so every one's there on Monday. I would expect there is a pretty slow build to getting people back, given how long they've been out of the office. And I don't know what that ratification is on leasing, on fundamentals, all the other income sources. So I'm just trying to - as I assume corporations are thinking about all this at this point given the vaccine distribution given, the efficacy, right. They're all trying to come up with their plans. And I just didn't know if you had more insights about if they flipped the switch, all right. It's no longer up and it's opt-out, How long that could last for as we move into that direction.. Owen Thomas : Michael, I don't think anybody is going to surprise their employees. I mean, we're doing it ourselves. We try to give a lot of preview over how we see the world and when people should anticipate coming back to work. So I think that will help in this repopulation that you described. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Mizuho Securities. Omotayo Okusanya : Yes. Sorry about that earlier. Can you hear me? Owen Thomas : Yes. We can hear you. Omotayo Okusanya : Perfect. All right. Just a quick one. I know we're running long. Could you talk a little bit about just how you're thinking about dispositions in 2021 given some of what you've seen in regards to asset pricing, uses of capital next year, and also your leverage target? Doug Linde : Yes. No, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we sold 500 between $500 million $600 million of assets in 2020 and that's an elevated level for us at least over the last five or six years. And we anticipate that level plus or minus going into 2021. We have a couple of assets we're working on now. As I described, the capital market conditions for office are reasonably favorable, particularly for assets with certain characteristics, and I think you should count on us selling around that level this year. Mike LaBelle : And from a leverage perspective, Tayo, we haven't changed our views on the leverage that we think is appropriate to run the Company. I think it is somewhere between the mid-6s in the mid-7s on the net debt to EBITDA basis. The leverage is obviously a little bit higher this year because of some of the income items that we've talked about. And then, if you look at our supplemental, our leverage is reported at 8.07 this quarter, but that's because the calculation annualizes the charges that we took this quarter. So we have provided a footnote that describes that if you pull out the charges, the effective leverage 7.26, which is within the range that we are comfortable operating in. And then, we've got a lot of income coming in from the development pipeline over the next couple of years that we've described and we've described in the past. A significant amount of that money has already been spent for that development pipeline. So that will naturally delever us over the next couple of years. Operator : We have time for one final question and that question comes from the line of Rick Skidmore with Goldman Sachs. Rick Skidmore : Thank you. Mike, just a quick modeling question. How should we be thinking about real estate taxes as we go forward, given maybe what we've seen in 2020? And then, are you hearing anything from the cities with regards to how they're thinking about real estate taxes? Thanks. Doug Linde : Hi, Rick. This is Doug Linde. So obviously, it's market by market, right? In California, we know exactly what's going to happen because of the legislative referendums that didn't pass. So that one is taken care of. In New York City, I am sure that assessments are going to go way down. We won't know what's going to happen with the tax rate, but in New York, everything is sort of bled in over a five-year period of time as those changes occur. So year-to-year, it's not a very big change, a.k.a., versus what it would have been where we not in this evaluation challenge. In a market like Boston, there's been so much addition to the supply that we actually don't expect to see much in the way of significant rises in real estate taxes because of the assessments have gone up, but there is more base. The cities have actually reduced the tariff rate so it hasn't been significant. And similarly, I think in the Greater DC area, we'll, obviously, see they have tri-year evaluations in the district and you don't see much difference unless you're building is being revalued. But net-net, I mean it's quite clear that to the extent that jurisdiction has some fiscal issues, I mean it's going to be looking to its real estate taxpayers to bear a portion of that, but I don't think in the short term, it's going to be a meaningful detractor in our revenue or impact our margins in a very significant way. Mike LaBelle : And obviously, our tenants, we escalate our real estate taxes to our tenants, so an increase doesn't come back to us unless we have vacancy or we have leases rolling. So only a small portion of that increase actually comes to us every year. Operator : And I would now like to turn the call back over to the speakers for any closing remarks. Owen Thomas : Thank you, operator. Thank you, everyone, for your interest in Boston Properties. That concludes the call, all our comments and questions. Thank you very much. Operator : This concludes today's Boston Properties conference call. Thank you again for attending and have a good day.",

And now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks. Owen Thomas : Thank you, Sarah, and good morning everyone. The BXP team is joining you today from our offices all over the country, where we are beginning to see renewed signs of life as our cities reopen with increasing activity on the street, in shops and restaurants, on public transportation and yes, even in office buildings where building census is picking up and tour activities accelerated.  U.S. GDP is growing at 4.3%. Over 1.6 million jobs were created in the first quarter. Weekly jobless claims are in decline and unemployment has dropped to 6%, only 2.5 percentage point above pre-pandemic levels of February last year. Professional service employment has remained healthy, which is important given our tenancy. U.S. retail sales surged 9.8% in March and air travel as measured by TSA Checkpoint is up 10x over a year ago, though still only 50% of pre-pandemic level.  The U.S. and global economic recoveries continue to follow the course of the virus and vaccination rollout. While new COVID-19 cases have remained sticky at around 60,000 per day since late February, all data including 3 million daily vaccinations, 43% of Americans having received at least one shot and the J&J vaccine reinstatement suggest the trajectory for a highly vaccinated population and fewer new COVID infections remain positive.  The U.S. economy will likely continue to surge given the financial health of most industry sectors, the significant federal fiscal stimulus provided to individuals and small business, accommodative monetary policy and pent-up consumption sparked by the pandemic reopening.  This recovery is starting to bring positive momentum to the office market and BXP's result. For the buildings we can track, our census last week was depending on the city, at or above the post pandemic peak established last October. In the first quarter we completed 592,000 square feet of leasing, 84% of the leasing volume we achieved in the first quarter of last year and 46% of our longer term first quarter average.  These leases had a weighted average term of 7.6 years. Our leases that commenced this quarter demonstrated a 15% roll up of net rent for second generation space. We exceeded our FFO per share forecast for the first quarter and the tenant charges we experienced in 2020 largely disappeared. More broadly, tenant requirements in our target markets in March based on data provided by VTS were up 33% versus the prior month and 51% versus the prior year. They were only down \u2013 they are still down 40% from pre-pandemic levels. Office markets are lagging other asset classes because very few employers are currently mandating in-person work. That is now changing rapidly as many large employers such as Google, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Ernst & Young, Facebook, Amazon, Apple and others have announced return to work planned for this summer.  We continue to see Labor Day as a key tipping point for employees returning to the office, with forecasts low COVID infection rates, high vaccination levels, the end of summer and schools reopening. We hear repeatedly from our clients, as well as in interviews we have completed with large occupiers that the key to future success and competitiveness is to successfully reintroduced in-person work. Unlike most recessions, most of our clients are thriving and have not reduced headcount. In our leasing activity and renewal conversations with clients, we have not seen material reduction in space requirements.  Now, moving to private equity market conditions, there were 15 billion of significant office assets solid in the first quarter though volumes were down 37% from the first quarter of last year. Assets with limited lease rollover and anything like science related currently receive the best pricing, often better than before the pandemic. There were again several deals of note completed in our market, including in San Francisco the exchange on 16th located in the Mission Bay District sold for $1.1 billion or $1,440 per square foot, a record price per square foot in San Francisco and it represented a 4.9% cap rate. This 750,000 square foot recently developed building is 100% leased to a tenant trying to sublease the entire building. The asset was sold to a fund manager which may attempt a life science conversion.  In Seattle 300 Pine, the Macy's building sold for $600 million or $779 per square foot at a 4.4% cap rate. The majority of the 770,000 square foot asset was recently converted to office space, which is 100% leased by Amazon and the remainder is undergoing further renovation. The building was purchased by a joint venture between a fund manager and a real-estate operator.  And in Mid Washington DC CDD, a 49% interest in mid-town center was sold to an offshore buyer. The building comprises 870,000 square feet and is substantially leased to Fannie Mae as its headquarters. The gross sale price was $980 million, $1,129 a square foot and a 4.7% cap rate.  Moving to BXP investment activities, let's start with our growing life science business. BXP currently has over 3 million square feet leased to life science clients, approximately 2 million square feet of current and future office to lab conversion projects and sites for approximately 4 million square feet of life-science ground up development, primarily located in among the strongest life science markets in the U.S., namely Cambridge, Waltham, and South San Francisco. We recently received 1 million square feet of new entitlement at Kendall Center in Cambridge, and our joint venture at Gateway Commons is in discussions with local authorities in San Francisco to increase entitlements by 1.5 million square feet.  We had a very active first quarter launching three new lab development and redevelopment projects, 180 City Point, a 330,000 square foot ground up development and part of our larger city point campus in Waltham with strong visibility from I95. Second, 880 Winter Street is a 224,000 square foot class A office asset we acquired in 2019 for $270 a square foot, and will redevelop into a lab building, and 751Gateway, a 229,000 square foot ground-up lab development as part of our Gateway Commons joint venture in which we own a 49% interest.  Though all three projects are being commenced speculatively, we are seeing many new life science requirements in both the Waltham and South San Francisco markets and have made multiple lease proposals to potential tenants. A large portion of our active development pipeline is now lab and currently comprises 920,000 square feet and $560 million of projected investment for our share with projected cash yield at stabilization of approximately 8%.  BXP has a rich history of success, serving the life science industry. We have the land and building inventory in the strongest life science clusters in the U.S., as well as the execution skill and client relationships to make life-sciences an even more meaningful component of our overall business.  Moving to the balance of our development pipeline, we delivered into service this quarter 159 East 53rd Street with 195,000 square feet of office fully leased to NYU, as well as the Hue which will open after Labor Day and serve as the unique culinary amenity for our three building, 53rd in Lexington Campus.  We remain on track to deliver our 100 Causeway development in Boston later this year which is pre-leased to Verizon, and we have four additional and significant projects later to deliver in 2022. This pipeline is 86% preleased with aggregate projected cash yield, stabilization projected to be approximately 7%.  To maintain our external growth in addition to adding the three life science projects, we also are investing approximately $182 million into an observatory redevelopment project on the top of the prudential tower in Boston. When complete, the observatory will have three level, comprised 59,000 square feet and will be a world class attraction featuring both indoor and outdoor 360 degree viewing decks, as well as exhibit and amenity spaces. The project will be the only observatory in Boston and we expect it will generate strong returns to BXP after delivery in the spring of 2023.  Net of all these movements, our active development pipeline currently stands at 10 development and redevelopment projects comprising 4.3 million aggregate square feet and $2.7 billion in total investment for our share. We expect these projects, long with the lease up of two residential buildings delivered in 2020, as well as 159 East 53rd Street to contribute 3.5% of annual and external growth to our NOI over the next three years.  We continue to actively pursue value added acquisitions in our core markets in Seattle. Despite the impact of the pandemic, office investment opportunities in our core markets remain highly competitive. To enhance our financial resources, execution speed and return, we have reached an agreement with two large scale sovereign investors to pursue select acquisitions together. The partners including BXP will commit up to $1 billion and will have the opportunity to invest one-third of the equity in each identified deal at their discretion. BXP will provide all real-estate services and has agreed to commit its acquisition deal flow to the partnership subject to specific carve out. We believe this venture with approximately $2 billion of investment capacity provides us the financial resources and return enhancement to be an even more nimble and competitive participant in the acquisitions market. We will announce the completion of the partnership, including the participants, once documentation is complete, likely in the next month.  Moving to dispositions, we recently completed the sale of our 50% interest in Annapolis Junction Buildings Six and Seven, our last two remaining properties in the Fort Meade Maryland Market. The buildings totaled approximately 247,000 square feet and sold for a gross price of $66 million, which is $267 a square foot. We have under contract three buildings in our VA95 business park in Springfield Virginia for a gross sale price of $70 million, and we also have under Letter Of Intent, the sale of several stabilize Suburban Buildings for another approximately $190 million. Additional asset sales are being evaluated and we believe our gross disposition volume in 2021 will exceed $500 million.  To conclude, BXP is emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic with strength and momentum. Leasing volumes and requirements are rising; office collections exceed 99%; our clients our healthy if not thriving; tenant credit charges have largely disappeared; our $30 million per quarter of lost variable revenue is poised to return with offices reopening. We've launched new life science development. Our active development pipeline is expected to deliver strong external growth and we've raised a warchest for new acquisitions to add even further growth. I remain confident in both our near term and long term growth prospects.  I turn it over to Doug. Doug Linde : Thanks Owen. Good morning everybody. I'm going to try and give you my best shot at it, describing the operating environment that we are seeing in our portfolio as we sit here in late April.  So as Owen said, the office tenants are deep into planning for their return to the physical in-person work environment as we approach the back half of 2021, and while there are lots of announcements as Owen said of relaunches, and our building census is up, we are still at pretty low level, and I think you know you can see that most clearly from a financial perspective when you look at our monthly or daily parking, which was basically flat in the first quarter to where it was in the fourth quarter of 2020.  Although you know just yesterday, as an example, we had a our meeting for our California Parking and we had 67 requests for additional monthly spaces, 42 of which are hard and to give you a perspective, we actually locked more than half of our monthly parking, over 800 monthly spaces in the market area center [ph], so things are picking up.  When we spoke to you late in January, we said that the first half of \u201821 was going to have a low level of market leasing activity as defined by executed leases and that statement still holds. The reports that are published by the commercial brokerage organizations describing broad market conditions and all the calls that are sponsored by the analysts that follow our sector really didn't have any surprises in them. Leasing volumes are up at their historical pace, there was modestly more sublet space which was added to the market and that translated into some negative absorption and increased availability, no surprised, no shocks.  Last quarter, I described the dynamics around sublet space, particularly opportunistic sublet space. Again, this is when tenants are listing our entire premises, obviously at no cost, with an expectation that they'll decide what to do if they actually get an offer that they can actually respond to down the road. But the reality of transitioning, when push comes to shove is that tenants may reoccupy, they may relocate and transact. And then they find a way to sublet a portion of their space, but not the whole space, so I\u2019ll give you a couple of examples. In Boston we had a 50,000 square foot tenant, two floors in our CBD portfolio, list their entire space. They successfully sublet one floor and then they pulled the second floor off and they are reoccupying in July. We completed actually against the long term fully furnished sublet space in Mountain View in the Silicon Valley and the user began to negotiate on a sublease, but when the prime landlord refused to agree to recognize the lease, the user quickly walked away and took direct space.  So I'm not going to downplay the fact that there is a lot of sublet space on the market, but a large portion of it is not accessible because of short term, un-workable existing conditions or quite frankly the user discomfort with the lessors\u2019 profile. And when you ask what percentages, I don't know, but it's meaningful and yesterday JLO came out with a report saying there was about a 1.5 million square feet of New York City sublet space that was brought, pulled from the market by those sub tenants. Now the headwind from the sublet space are going to exists, but they're going to dissipate as companies return to in-person work. Obviously we are also confronting the caution that some organizations are facing as they work through how they move beyond having their employees working from their homes and only interacting on video call that are typically scheduled days in advance.  This may delay decisions to increase space needs, even though companies have hired more staff as Owen said, during this COVID shutdown and now as the economy is reopening. This backdrop is obviously going to add some more short term pressure on lease economics in some markets. It's not going to affect all the markets in the same way, and it's certainly not going to impact all the buildings in those markets in the same way either. The potential impact on pricing of sublet space and work-from-home makes a really dramatic commentary, but it's not going to be driving Boston Properties result. I hope the following analysis will illustrate that point. So the average gross rent on our expiring office space portfolio in 2021, 2022 and 2023, so the next almost three years totals about $5.8 million square feet, and the average expiring rent is about $65.50 per square foot.  So if you believe that pre-pandemic market rents on that space were $70 a square foot, and I'm just using that as an example, but it's close, and you wanted to measure the impact of some kind of a decline, and this is an example, not a statement or anything, what we think is going on with rent, so let\u2019s use 10% as an example. Then you would get to about a 4% roll down in rent or $2.50 a square foot or approximately $4.8 million per year over three years, that's it, that's the impact of the decline in rents on our portfolio from weak conditions. And as a point of reference, the change in second generation gross lease rent this quarter was positive 9.5%. Now that's a deal that started and was signed previous to this quarter. As I go through my remarks, I'm going to talk about where rents are on spaces that we physically signed leases on this quarter, or that we are working on now, and how those rents compare to existing in-place rents.  So that\u2019s it for my remarks for the Boston Property portfolio. I'm going to describe our level of activity and I think it's going to be counter to the weak macro market conditions that you're hearing about in macro reports. So let\u2019s start with our occupancy. Our in service portfolio occupancy which includes a 100% of our JVs ended the quarter 140 basis points down or 640,000 square feet. Now 50% of that space that was added to our vacancy this quarter provided no revenue over the last 12 months, that is it was space that we were trying to recapture from defaulting tenants.  In other words, much of this drop in occupancy doesn't reflect in any future revenue decline. This includes the Lord & Taylor box at the Prudential Center where we are in active discussions that we expect will result in a dramatic increase in the revenue from that piece of space. The office space that was given back by Asana at Times Square Tower and their [inaudible] retail outlook is a branch of that.  Next quarter we are going to have another one of these, as we take back the Arclight Cinema space since they officially ceased to operate. That\u2019s a 66,000 square foot lease at the The Hub on Causeway joint venture, and again, they never paid rent.  Also this quarter, we took back 62,000 square feet in a recapture so we could expand a growing tenant that we are negotiating a lease extension on, an extension at Colorado Center, but that lease hasn't been executed yet so the space is in vacancy. We did have one disappointment, which was the 200,000 square foot departure at the Santa Monica Business Park. However, today as I sit here talking to you have 640,000 square feet of signed leases that have yet to commence and they are not included in our occupied in-service portfolio. Unless we're actually booking revenue we don't consider it occupied.  On a relative basis, my view of the linking activity in our portfolio, so this is active lease negotiations, tours, RFPs is as fallows from top to bottom : Boston, Waltham, we don't really have any space in Cambridge, so I don't include that. Midtown Manhattan is second, the San Francisco CBD is third, Northern Virginia is fourth, followed by the Silicon Valley Peninsula, West LA Princeton and the DC CBD. All the transactions I am going to describe to you our post-COVID negotiations having begun in the latter half of 2020 or 2021. So let\u2019s start in Boston, which by the way represents over a third of the company's total revenue. So during the first quarter in the Boston CBD we did five leases totaling 37,000 square feet and in every case the starting rent represented a gross rent roll up of between 12% and 25%. We continue to have additional activity in the CBD portfolio, albeit it\u2019s with a preponderance of smaller tenants as we don\u2019t have much in the way of lots available, and we are working on eight leases totaling over 60,000 square feet.  Of the 30 leases we have done this quarter or in the works, none of those customers are contracting and five are expanding and more than doubling their footprint. In the suburban portfolio, we completed 124,000 square foot of new leasing. The cash rent of those leases was up by 50%. We continue to have additional activity in Suburban Boston. In Waltham we are negotiating six more transactions totaling over 60,000 square feet.  In the suburban portfolio, we have had some existing tenants expand and some contract, but we will be gaining occupancy with new tenants coming into the BXP portfolio like our new tenants at 20 City Point, and 195 West Street in Waltham, again those leases haven't commenced yet.  Life science demand in Walton continues to accelerate. We announced our plans to reposition 880 Winter Street in early March that had significant tour activity and have begun making proposals. This 220,000 square foot building will be available for tenant build out in the second quarter of \u201822.  In New York, since the beginning of the year we've had more physical tours than we had in the comparable period in 2020 and in 2019. We completed three leases during the quarter, totaling to 38,000 square feet, including a full floor expansion by a tenant at 399 Park. In total, the gross rents on the space was about 5% higher than in-place rent. Now I said New York City is our second most active region, and we're negotiating 14 office leases totaling over 170,000 square feet, including a full four lease at Dock 72 in Brooklyn. We also have two other active proposals to Dock 72, each in excess of 100,000 square feet.  The majority of these New York City leases will be full term in excess of five years and more than half of those tenants are new to the portfolio. We had one midtown tenant pull their space off the sublet market and another large tenant that it still has its enter space listed has began to repopulate. Five of the 14 active deals represent tenants that are negotiating expansions. Activity at the street point of our buildings is also picking up. When negotiating leases for food outlets at our 53rd Street, are eagerly anticipating the opening of the Hue Culinary Collective at 601 Lex later this year, and we have a new lease negotiation for our vacancy on the Street in Times Square Tower.  In Princeton, during the quarter, we completed four transactions and we executed a fifth at the beginning of April for a total of 28,000 square feet and we're negotiating leases for another 29,000 square feet, all in new tenants.  Activity in the DC region was light during the quarter with only 50,000 square feet of office leasing. But as the calendar moved to April, we signed another 170,000 square feet, 210,000 square feet of its totally leasing was completed on currently vacant space and included two large leases at Met Square in the district, and an expanding tenant in Reston Town Center. We have another 68,000 square feet of leases in processing in the DC region, including 25,000 square feet in Reston from another expanding tenant.  In the Town Center renters as basically flat to slightly down 1% to 2% since the re-let rents have been adjusted by the fact that the current rents have been increasing contractually by 2.5% to 3% for the last you know five to 10 years.  I would also note that retail activity in Reston has picked up. We have now opened four new restaurants since November of \u201920. We are negotiating leases with new food outlets totaling 27,000 square feet; they are going to open in \u201922. Pedestrian activity in Reston Town Center is active.  California has finally begun to reopen and allow for higher levels of office occupancy, although it's still way behind the rest of our market. During the quarter in Embarcadero Center, we settled rent arbitration on two multi floor five year extensions, and completed another 10 year full floor renewal. The markup on these three deals totaling 125,000 square feet was 46%. Tour activity for small tenants, lower or under has picked up and grown about 40% sequentially month to month from January to April. I would characterize half of our San Francisco CBD activity is with expanding tenants and half is with tenants that are contracting. The uncertain level and the lack of pedestrian activity at the street plant, particularly in the CBD of San Francisco has been more severe than anywhere else in our portfolio. This has affected tenants\u2019 appetite for making any decisions. But large tenants have started to begin to look for space. There have been a number of tourists on the high quality sublet offering delta market. We see the activity in the proposals on the available sublet space we have at 680 Folsom.  In South San Francisco, we signed a lease of 61,000 square feet at 601 Gateway, that's going to absorb about 50% of the exploration that\u2019s going to occur in the second quarter. We are under way at 751 Gateway, our first lab facility development in South San Francisco and have begun responding to proposals for this early 2023 delivery. 651 Gateway will be taken out of service in the second quarter of \u201822 when the final tenant vacates and we will commence a lab conversion of that 293,000 square foot building.  In Mountain View we continue to see a constant flow of medical dividing, alternate energy, battery storage, automotive and other R&D users looking for space. We are in renewal discussions with 24,000 square foot tenants and have commenced lease negotiation with the second tenant for 30,000 square feet on market ready vacant space and we have a tenant ready to go on a remaining floor of 18,000 square feet at 244 [inaudible]. There are some large tech tenants in the market down in the valley today looking for expansion space and we are certainly chasing those tenants if the timing were to match for our potential delivery at Platform 16.  In spite of the challenging COVID conditions in California, in Santa Monica we continue our new renewal negotiations with the 260,000 square foot tenant at Colorado Center and as I said at the outset, we recaptured about 60,000 square feet that's going to roll into that tenant expansion. We\u2019ve also signed a lease for 72,000 square feet at Colorado Center with Roku who's new to the portfolio.  As you may recall, earlier \u2013 late last year we did an expansion with the staff at the Santa Monica Business Park. So to summarize, the take away from my comment, it's true that market fundamentals are weaker than they were a year ago, but what would drives our same store portfolio, performance will be occupancy pick up, as well as the return of our parking income and the recovery of our retail activity and revenue.  There are tenants in our portfolio that are expanding in every one of our markets. Conditions are going to vary dramatically by some market. Rents may or may not decline depending upon the submarket, but we will still have embedded markup in our portfolio. There will be a flight to quality as better buildings see more tenant demand and tenant value paying less of a premium to be in the best assets, initial improved our occupancy. Let me turn to Mike. Mike LaBelle : Great, thanks Doug. Great summary. Good morning everybody. I'm going to start my comments this morning with little pieces on our activity in the debt capital markets. We had a very busy quarter and it impacted our results. As we guided last quarter, we redeemed $850 million of our expiring unsecured bonds that had 408% coupon using available cash.  In addition to that, and not part of our prior guidance, we issued another $850 million of new 11 year unsecured green bonds at an attractive coupon of 2.55%. The proceeds were used to repay our $500 million unsecured term loan that was due to expire next year, and we redeemed at par an expensive $200 million 5.25% preferred equity security.  We incurred non-cash charges during the quarter of approximately $7 million or $0.04 per share related to writing-off unamortized financing costs. Our next bond expiration is not until early 2023 when we have $1 billion expiring at an above market interest rate of 3.95%.  In advance of that, in early \u201922, we have a $626 million mortgage expiring on 601 Lexington Avenue in New York City. This loan also carries an above market interest rate of 4.75%.  So turning to our earnings results for the quarter, for the first quarter we reported FFO of $1.56 per share; that was $0.001 above the mid-point of our guidance range. The variances to our guidance were comprised of $0.04 per share of higher NOI from the portfolio and a $0.001 per share of higher fee income, partially offset by the $0.04 per share non-cash charge related to our refinancing activity. The portfolio NOI outperformance included $0.02 per share of lower operating expenses during the quarter, much of which will be incurred later in the year. And on the revenue side, we collected delinquent 2020 rent from several of our retail tenants, whose rents are being recognized on a cash basis. These collections drove a significant portion of our $0.02 revenue deal.  As we described last quarter, we believe the vast majority of our tenant credit charges are behind us. Our net write-offs this quarter were immaterial and collections from our office clients continue to be consistent and very strong. We provided guidance for the second quarter of 2021 FFO in our earnings release of $1.59 to $1.61 per share. At the midpoint, this is $0.04 per share better sequentially from the first quarter. The expected improvement M&As from lower seasonal G&A expense and the sensation of preferred dividends from our redemption, also the first quarter financing charges are not expected to recur. Partially offsetting this, we project lower termination income in Q2 and as Doug explained, our occupancy declined by 140 basis points this quarter, which was expected but results in a sequential drop in portfolio NOI from the half that was paying rent before.  We expect another drop in occupancy next quarter followed by a modest improvement in the back half of the year. Doug described 640,000 square feet of signed leases that have yet to commence occupancy. 460,000 square feet of this will take occupancy later this year, representing over 100 basis points of occupancy pick up.  While we're still not providing full year specific guidance, given the uncertainty and timing of our ancillary revenue streams, we did provide you with a framework for 2021 in our last call.  As you revisit your models for the full year, there are three other changes to consider. First, our financing activities during the first quarter have a net impact of increasing interest expense, about $5 million for the year. Second, we have a loss of rental revenue from taking 880 Winter Street out of service for redevelopment into a life science facility, which has a negative impact of about $2 million. And lastly, the additional $260 million of dispositions that Owen described are expected to result in the loss of about $7 million of NOI. In aggregate these items are expected to reduce FFO for the rest of 2021 by approximately $14 million or $0.08 per share.  Looking further ahead to 2022, we\u2019ve made substantial investments in prelease developments that will drive earnings growth. We anticipate delivering 100 Causeway Street in Boston and 200 West Street in Waltham late in 2021, representing $315 million of investment in our share that is collectively 95% leased. The contribution from these two development deliveries will not be that significant to 2021, but they will be at a full run rate in 2022.  The bulk of the remaining pipeline is projected to deliver in 2022. This includes our building for Google in Cambridge, Reston Next for Fannie Mae and Volkswagen, The Marriott Headquarters in 2,100 Pennsylvania Avenue. This represents delivery of $1.7 billion of investment in 2022 at our share, and 2.7 million square feet that is currently 85% preleased. This $2 billion of investment in conjunction with the recovery of our ancillary income sources and improved leasing activity post pandemic sets us up for occupancy improvement in a period of solid future earnings growth. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Owen. Owen Thomas : Thanks Mike. Before we take questions, there is just a last couple of things here I'd like to mention. Last week on Earth Day we published our 2020 ESG report, where we made several important commitments, and those include \u2013 we set a goal to achieve carbon neutral operations by 2025. In addition BXPs had previously set a carbon emissions reduction goal in line with the most ambitious designation available under the science based targets initiatives program. In 2020 BXP was one of six North American real estate companies with this distinction and the only North American office company.  We also established a new board level sustainability committee, to among other things increase the board oversight of and input for our sustainability issues. And lastly, we launched an internal diversity and inclusion committee last year with the mission of pursuing greater diversity among our workforce and vendors, as well as new programs supporting diversity and fairness in our community.  BXP\u2019s proud of its consistent recognition as an industry leader in sustainability and ESG, an area increasingly important to our clients, our community, capital providers and employees.  And then lastly there's one important milestone that I want to mention. This will be Peter Johnston\u2019s last earnings call as he's retiring from Boston Properties next month after 33 years of service. Peter\u2019s been an outstanding leader in our Washington DC business and he will be greatly missed by all of you, by all of us. Thank you very much Peter.  Operator, we're ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey, good morning. Mike, I guess just going to the guidance question, you know in the last quarter you talked about sort of an unofficial 652 when you took sort of the run rate and then made the changes for the DNA and we\u2019re very excited with what you guys have planned. That would suggest then 2010\u2019s [ph] pick up with the second half of this year, but you just outlined about $0.08 of negative that is incremental to that. So is that 652 sort of now 645-ish type number or is there some other things that may impact where we should be thinking about where this year will end up? Mike LaBelle : So, I mean that was the reason I described that $0.08 was because of that fact, because these are new things that happened this quarter that we didn't project in our prior guidance, which was not the pay out of the larger bond that we have, but the new bond that we did and then the sale from these assets. So yes, I want to describe those FFO drops for later this year. Now, we\u2019ve given some guidance for second quarter and it does show that we will have pick up later in the year, and I think that if you look at Q2 you're going to \u2013 we expect to have a further drop in occupancy in Q2, and if you look at our rollover schedule, about 60% of the main rollover for the year is sitting in just Q2. So Q3 and Q4 have very light rollover exposure, so we do expect to have some pick up in occupancy and revenue in the back half of the year from that leasing activity, and we would expect occupancy by the end of the year to be somewhere between 88% and 89%.  And then as I also said, we had 460,000 square feet signed that this was going to occupy this year, so that\u2019s part of that number. So the improvement in the back half of the year is coming from a combination of some occupancy improvement from Q2 through Q4, and we also expect our parking to start to improve. As Doug mentioned it, we're starting to see some green shoots with the parking, they'll be helpful. And then we have a couple of the development deliveries that I talked about, you know 100 Causeway and that sort of revenue provided later in the year. So those are the things that would pick-up in the back half. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. So in that Mike, the negative $0.08 that you mentioned right now, that you're hoping for a positive recovery on the ancillary deposits [ph], etc. It sounds like still we're sort of probably in an upper 640\u2019s, maybe 650. It\u2019s sort of mentally how the street could be thinking about it. A - Owen Thomas : Yeah, I think the street should be thinking about it as if we\u2019re \u2013 you know we feel good about the ability to kind of improve in the second half of the year, but there are already sales that we're going to have. So it's going to be down from what I told you last quarter. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. The second question is \u2013 oh! And you didn't mention the MTA site in your prepared remarks. Certainly there seems to be a lot more interest around Grand Central, especially with the coming of the inside access and the ease of commuting. You got the Hyatt project, whatever we know there as the 350 Park, then obviously your site numbers got to like probably one or two others that people try to cancel. Maybe if you could just give an update on how in your tenant discussions, you know how anchor tenants that you guys will be after, are thinking about taking \u2013 potentially anchoring one of those projects. A - Owen Thomas : John Powers, are you on the line? John Powers : I\u2019m on the line Owen. First, let me say we're very excited about the NGA site, it\u2019s a terrific site. It's a better site now than it was a couple of years ago and it'll be a better sight in four or five years than it is now with JP Morgan finishing there. We're entering a new loop, so we have to go through the process. We don't know how that will come out. We have to go through the whole community board, etc., to find out how big the building will be. We\u2019ve drawn it a certain way and we're very excited to present it. This is going to be quite a few years out from now, so we're not talking to any space. Owen Thomas : Yeah, I didn't mention Alex, just because of the time frame, but we're very excited about this site and it\u2019s just the Grand Central hearing that we think is improving. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay, great, thank you. Owen Thomas : Yup. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Nick Yulico : Thanks. Good morning everyone. So I appreciate all the commentary there on the rents for the leases signed in the quarter. I just wanted to see if you could give us a feel for what the blended gross rent number was, you know the increase for the quarter on the signed, not executed leases. And then also maybe if you could just give us a feel for how that number would be different on a net effective basis and so continuing here is seeing the face rents are down less than net effective rents. A - Mike LaBelle : So Nick, I don't have that information at my rental disposal here. The numbers are obviously up. I mean they were something that I described that were up 5% and there were some that I described that were up 50%. This quarter there happened to be a lot more leases that we executed that were up 50% that 5%, so the number's going to spew up. With regards to net effective, none of the transactions that we have been working on have had much in the way of significant changes in either free rent or TI\u2019s. I would say we've been building more space, but we were building more space pre-COVID, so there hasn't been a pickup in the cost of space, particularly on the TI side that we've seen yet, which is obviously good. So I don't think that has really impacted where our results are showing on a relative basis from sort of nine months ago to where we are today. Nick Yulico : Okay, thanks. My second question is on the topic of unassigned seating plans. We have seen some examples on your portfolio, but in New York City market we\u2019ve got some tenants moving now increasingly to unassigned seating plans or space per desk maybe going up, right, but space per employee is going down, because we\u2019ll not be having \u2013 pretty sure we \u2013 that are best for our employees. And so I guess I'm wondering, you know and this can be seen not only for a mature firm kind of downsizing, but also for a smaller tech firm who is expanding and are expanding as it would have been in the past, but it\u2019s in the wrong side of the seating. So I guess I'm wondering, you know in your portfolio if you're seeing any examples of this, you know what your thoughts are on this topic. Thank you. Doug Linde : So, let me just give a quick comment on that. So first of all, I just got a whole host of expanding tenants in our portfolio and particularly on the smaller side, they are not making any changes to the way they are utilizing their space. Most of those smaller tenants are in the financial asset management professional services sector and they are building our perimeter offices in to our larger workstation areas, and everyone is getting the workstation and nobody's sharing anything, okay. So there's a significant component of the market in terms of the transaction volume that is in that sector. The rest of the larger tenants have \u2013 I think there is a whole spectrum of results that you're going to see. We had a tenant that took 75,000 square feet of space in Waltham and provided a \u2013 put a press release out with us you know a couple weeks ago and they basically said, we're obviously not putting a workstation in for every single person in our organization who lives in the Boston area, and we're anticipating that there are going to be some people who are working from home. I have a daughter who is working for a tech company in New York City and their mandate was, if you're not prepared to work X number of days per week, you're not getting a permanent workstation and you're going to have to work on the hoteling side, right. Owen had conversation and he'll describe them with some of the larger technology companies across the country and they have a very different perspective. Owen Thomas : Yeah, I would just add to what Doug said. You know a lot of this where employers are trying to accommodate their workforce preferences and certainly that includes flexibility, but if you look at some of the surveys that were done, most notably by Gendler [ph] 90% of those surveys said they wanted a fixed workstations, and I think around \u2013 and I know around two-thirds of those surveys said they would not trade a fixed workstation for a custom work benefit, so. And then you've got the COVID issues you know, which makes sharing a desk more uncomfortable. So look, I can't tell you Nick that we\u2019re not going to see some of that, but I'm not sure it's going to be a torrent of activity. Nick Yulico : Thank you. John Powers : Can I just make a comment here? John Powers. Nick Yulico : Yeah. John Powers : I've heard a lot about this and in a lot of discussions about this, but I can tell you, in our portfolio in New York, not a single tenant has pulled a building permit to make any changes to their space related to COVID and we have almost 1 million square feet under construction during COVID and there was not one change order made by any of those tenants to adjust his plans pre-COVID while they were under construction. So I think this is a lot of wait and see. It takes a lot of capital to make the adjustments that I hear people talking about. Nick Yulico : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Thanks, good morning. Mike, I just wanted to try and piece together a couple of things you talked about when you're going through guidance and through the bridge from 1Q to 2Q. You guys talked about occupancy being down, but not all of that was sort of cash paying occupancy. So I just wanted to maybe try and figure out you know what\u2019s the loss revenue moving into Q2 and then you talked about rents being collected, kind of background being collected in Q1 for 2020 rent. It sounds like that might have been a one-time pick up, so I was just trying to think about those two as we kind of move into the next quarter. Owen Thomas : I agree with you Steve that some of the retail rent that we got in the first quarter was more one-time. We had both clients paying us for delinquency and also we had some termination income in the first quarter that we don't expect a repeat. And our termination income was about $4.5 million for the quarter, so that's more than what it normally would be. So you know I think that about half of the occupancy that we lost in the first quarter with non-rent paying last year, but half of it was, and then again we expect to lease some more occupancy this quarter, because we have some rollover coming.  So I mean I think that, you know if you think about the amount of kind of lower portfolio NOI from that. It's you know probably $0.03 or $0.04 quarter-to-quarter and then there's a couple of cents of the termination income, and so that's a negative. And then you've got you know the positives for the quarter are \u2013 obviously are G&A seasonal. You know the preferred dividend is only about $0.001 and you know the financing charges were $0.04.  So overall we\u2019re sequentially up, and then again I think the second quarter should be the bottom and that's where our kind of exposure to rollover really, really slows for the last two quarters and we've got signed leases coming on and we do have some renewals and some other activity we\u2019re working on. So honestly a lot of activity that Doug talked about that we\u2019re working on. This is for 2022 at this point. Steve Sakwa : Got it, thanks. And then I know it's a little bit far out, but if you think about the observatory, how did you guys think about sort of the underwriting for that as you thought about visitors and the expense load. Obviously we had some exposure and understanding of observatories from one of your other public peers, but how did you guys think about you know kind of the revenue and the expense structure of that you know? Owen Thomas : Go ahead, Doug. Doug Linde : So Steve, the answer to your question is, at this point it's an estimate, right. It's a projection. We obviously don't have a observatory experience in Boston that we can point to, but we do have three or four in New York, and we took what I would say is a very conservative view on a number of visitors that we would get relative to the kind of visitation that is going on in New York City, and we have a price point that's lower than the price point in New York City, and we have a long ramp up. And we look at that relative to the visitors that were going to destinations like Duck Tours, The Freedom Trail, The New England Aquarium, The Science Museum, The Museum of Fine Arts and we kind of triangulated into a range of where we thought we would start and where we might get to, and obviously you know there's an expense load that we will be able to ramp up or down depending upon volumes, and so we don't expect to be cash flow positive in the first six months of this thing, but as time goes on we think this is going to be a very productive opportunity and it's going to be a unique offering in the city of Boston, and we have the capacity to put a lot of people up there and push a lot of people through and we're creating a dedicated entry.  And the thing that I think people will experience that they have not experienced in the Boston market is, you have a 360 degree outdoor experience at the top of the Prudential Tower, looking out to the harbor, you got Fenway Park, to the Back Bay in Cambridge, and it\u2019s an amazing place. I mean you're going to be outside 365 days a year as long as you don't mind cold weather in certain months. Bryan Koop : This is Bryan Koop. Some additional things that went into it were service providers that are acting as consultants for us, operate several observatories throughout the world, so we use their advice on that. We also had historic numbers from our old observatory, plus we had historic numbers from the Hancock Tower, which at one time many years ago, there was two observatories in the city of Boston. We had numbers from what those two observatories were doing at the same time.  And in addition we threw in a mix of what we know our daily traffic counts at peak times at the Prudential Center were and what we may be able to capture there as well. But I may add that the city of Boston, we met with them just this last week and took the mayor through and state officials and we're really excited about the support they want to provide us on this. Steve Sakwa : I guess just as a quick follow-up, do you guys expect this to be kind of a double digit return on capital or maybe not quite that good? A - Owen Thomas : I would hope that it starts out you know in the low single digits and over a couple of years gets into the double digit thing and it goes from there, and obviously we're going to have to make some capital investment if we get the traffic that we hope we're going to get, but it could be a substantial opportunity for revenue and net income for the company. Steve Sakwa : Got it, thanks. That\u2019s it from me. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi. Manny Korchman : Just in the conversations with you and other landlords and the brokers, there's this commentary that tour activities what you have get you know leases, haven't actually been signed and occupancies have dipped up. Is that tour activity tenants that are potentially exploring, just changing their space within the market and it's just that \u2013 it's kind of like you going to an open house in your street, even if you're not thinking about moving your personal home and that's why tour activity is up, or is there sort of a more fruitful result of that tour activity and it just hasn't come yet? A - Owen Thomas : So I just wanted \u2013 I wanted to sort of ground you in the following way, which is when we were talking to you in January, I think it was January 30, we were pretty heavily into the last COVID wave, okay. So we are 60 days from that and we are probably 40 days away, you know out of sort of the worst of it relative to how much viruses are around. It takes time for leases to get signed, right, there\u2019s a process. So that's why I said there should be no \u2013 shouldn't have been any expectation of the activity in the first quarter. It was higher than what you saw relative to what we published by the brokerage connect houses, because there just wasn't time to do things. We are seeing a lot of activity now that I tried to describe was significant amounts of expanding tenants which grew on the smaller side, and then tenants that are looking to change their facilities and upgrade their premises. Now it is absolutely true that there's musical chairs associated with those kinds of demand generators, right. Somebody's in an older building with 50,000 square feet and they move into a new building, it might be 45,000 square feet, it might be 55,000 square feet.  There is no question that there is not a lot of positive incremental growth overall in the market today, but you got to start at some place and we\u2019re starting with tours and we're starting with lease expirations and we\u2019re starting with incremental smaller growth and smaller tenants. And as I said, we're seeing a few signs, particularly in California and some of the other West Coast markets of large scale demand from some of the large, what we refer to as tech titans. I can't tell you if that's going to translate into additional absorption of growth from smaller technology companies. I think my comments were, there\u2019s going to be a lot of it as Owen and I talked, experimentation and figuring this out and there\u2019s going to be a delay relative to picking up incremental space while that goes on and people understand how they are going to be utilizing their physical environment and their human capital and how they mesh those two things together. But I think you're going to see a lot more activity. I don't necessarily think you're going to see a lot of positive absorption from growth, but you\u2019re going to see positive absorption from sublet space coming off the market.  You know one of the other tours [ph] from Boston, this just may be specific to Boston, but I can't think of one example of tours that we've had over the last, let\u2019s say six months, are descriptive of what you talked about where it\u2019s just looking at open houses.  When you think of the significance of what it takes to get a tour going, let's say five or six months ago, for the client and the broker, etc., to get them out of homes and coordinate, its significant and one of the things that's been really interesting is the quality information that we get on each of these, call it perspective assignments, and these are all very definitive in terms of what kind of square footage they need and they have no quality of representative, what you're talking about, whether they're just out kind of taking a look around at what might be out there. These are very specific requirements. Manny Korchman : Great, I appreciate that. And then Owen, I know you said you\u2019d give us more details on the southern ventures in about a month, but thinking about the acquisition for the election environment more general, the assets that have had transacted have been at which valuations and sort of lockdown leases for a long amount of time. That's sort of not what I think you would want to buy, but maybe those sovereigns would buy.  So in those conversations that you're having with them, is this going to be a targeting value-add type stock. Is it more the types of assets that we have been trading and how do you tie sort of the valuation environment right now between those two pools together with forming a JV right now, yeah. Owen Thomas : Manny, this \u2013 we're not going to be targeting core asset at low cap rates, that's not our goal. We're a property company; we want to use our real estate skills to create value. We're going to eventually going to be targeting assets that need to be re-imagined, repositioned or simply leased up, and we're going to be a major co-investor and these two sovereign groups, like our plans and also forecasts that there will be opportunities.  As I've mentioned in previous quarters, it is true that most of the deal flow, most of the things that are happening are in the more core like assets, because there's liquidity for those, there's not a discussion about lease up and market rents and those types of things and the bid and the ask can merge. I will say, I do think our pipeline of value added deals is growing. We are looking at more of these deals today. You know COVID has been going on now for over a year. There are a lot of owners of these kinds of assets that just want to sell for whatever reason and we're seeing it, more of it come to the market. So you know we'll see if the bid they are asking will narrow on those deals, but our pipeline is definitely elevated in the last month or two. Manny Korchman : And oh! Just to clarify, the size of this venture would be $1 billion of equity total and that has levers too or it\u2019s going to be too big of an equity total and then we haven\u2019t talked about that. A - Owen Thomas : Yeah, it's not a committed fund. The $1 billion is just the capital that the investors have set aside for the venture and I do think it's anticipated that we\u2019ll carry probably 50% leverage at the property level on whatever we buy, but it will be investment by investment and if it goes well, it could be bigger, but these are just the initial allocation to capital for the venture. Manny Korchman : Great! Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line up Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Jamie Feldman : Great! Thank you and good morning. So, I wanted to get your latest thoughts and co-working and flexible space providers across the markets, you know as tenants start to think about coming back or their needs going forward. How do you think those types of users will or those types of space providers will fit into their plans and has that changed? Owen Thomas : I think Jamie, I think there will be demand for shared workspace product going forward. I think there'll be individual demand, I think there'll be small company demand, and I think large occupiers as well will want to procure a small percentage of their space on a flexible basis and will pay a premium for it. There's plenty of this product out in the market created by WeWork and many of the other companies as well as a landlords like ourselves, and you know I think the first step will be the retelling of that space, but I do think that demand will come back. Mike LaBelle : You realize Jamie that there\u2019s a, I'd say flexible operator 2.0 is happening, which is JLL is working with IGW, Newmark is working with another group, you know Nootel, CBRE or CNW and Hannah have their arrangement with industrious.  So there seems to be a change in the offering composition relative to it being more of a service as opposed to a transaction where someone is trying to arbitrage retail and wholesale rents, where you're taking the space of wholesale in theory and leasing it to retail. So there is going to be some change, and they are presumably the landlords that have gotten space, that will work with these operators to figure out better ways to market and to achieve occupancy.  I think that the really interesting question, and I wish we had the answer to it is, how profitable can it be and what are the economics of the transactions that are being signed by the tenants and obviously the densities are going to change to some degree because of the nature of how tight those many of those operators were packing people in, and will the users pay the premium in order to give the operators the margin necessary to make it work, and I think that \u2013 you know we\u2019ll see what happens. Ray Ritchey : Hey Doug, to that point, this is Ray. Bryan hosted a property management seminar with our four top tenants; our professional services, law firms, tech, and he posed the question, does co-working play a role in your future space needs? Every single one said affirmatively that co-working does have a role in meeting their space needs in future and that\u2019s directly from the user group. Jamie Feldman : Thank you. So do you think from a BXP perspective, those types of tenants grow on the portfolio or do you think maybe you just have to have more flexibility structures to compete for tenants, you know larger tenants that might want to\u2026 Mike LaBelle : Well, I think \u2013 I would just say the following. I think what you are hearing from us is we expect the demand increase. I think the other thing that you guided, you got a lot of the space that\u2019s not full at the moment, because its flexible. So a lot of the tenants left and the occupancy is quite low. So the first step is just going to be refilling all of the inventory that's out in the market that either landlords own or the flexible operators own themselves.  I think the interesting question which Doug was touching on is okay, once all that's full, then what happens? Are the economics of this business such that it makes sense to do the expensive build-out and to build more of it, and I think that's going to be the question that\u2019s going to need to be answered in the years ahead as once all of these existing supply gets filled up. Ray Ritchey : And OT \u2013 this is Ray again. We are seeing a fight to quality on the co-working which is really great for our portfolio, because in the vast majority of our markets, the best co-working experiences in our Boston properties building. So there may maybe more -- less attractive co-working things that go by the wayside, and they're going to abrogate in the best options for their clients and again that's good for us. Jamie Feldman : Alright, great, thanks for the color. And then you had mentioned both Dock 72 and Platform 16 as seeing a little bit more interest. I know platform 16 is obviously larger, you know longer out, but can you talk more about what's changed for those assets or how you are thinking about activity? Doug Linde : There are more tenants who are asking for proposals, because there are, people have gotten out of hibernation as Owen and I talked about it earlier today. There is just more overall demand and look we're negotiating the lease at Dock 72. We weren\u2019t negotiating a lease 90 days ago and 180 days we weren\u2019t talking to anybody. So there is just a natural progression, and look, it\u2019s a fabulous product that you know the team in New York built, and you know its ready available and we have to get people to start walking through it looking for space, and that's what's going on.  And again, I think you're seeing people come out of hibernation relative to large tech demand as well. We saw some of it that was going on during COVID. So it never stopped, but it I think that we are going to see some acceleration of that across the country, and hopefully it will fall into some of the markets that we operate in. Jamie Feldman : So would you say it\u2019s more, the fact that it\u2019s closer to where people live, it's not necessarily like a down town or like a mid-town Manhattan asset, and there is a change in what people want or no, this is just because the building is finally built, people can tour it, interest is rising. Owen Thomas : John, you want to describe the locational interest from the demand that we have? John Powers : Yes, well I think it's more the latter of what you said, that as Dough said, people are back. As we got caught with that building with COVID and that we had not finished the amenities prior to COVID and the amenities are very, very big part of the building if you haven't seen it or you should really come out. And now it's done and it's showing really well. The tenant, one tenant is from Manhattan and another \u2013 two are from Manhattan that Doug mentioned earlier with the lease out and paper being traded with the other two \u2013 two from Manhattan and one from Brooklyn. So it's really the buildings, as Doug said, the building looks great and people are around looking at things, knowing that they wanted to go back to the office and wanted to start the process. Jamie Feldman : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of it Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Derek Johnston : Hi everybody. Thank you. From our data, this is probably the second softest leasing quarter in over a decade on volumes. But when we kind of mix in concessions it clearly looks to be the weakest, which is understandable. So the question is, are you starting to reduce TI's, and free rent as the reopening momentum gained steam or are concessions at elevated levels still required to get deals done in this environment? Owen Thomas : So Derek, again I just want to ground you right. There was very little activity in the first quarter because of the nature of what was going on with the pandemic, and there's a lot more activity now. The real-estate transaction leasing market is a relatively long sales cycle and I don\u2019t think we are going to see dramatic changes in the economics in our market places over the next couple of quarters. If you ask me, will transaction volume and will concessions start to reduce in 2022? I think the answer is sure, absolutely I feel very confident that that's going to happen, but I think the next couple of quarters it's going to be, you know we are going to be leading into the recovery of leasing volume and as I said earlier, I think there is going to be not much in the way of positive absorption overall from new tenant growth, but there will be a positive absorption from sublet reduction.  And so I think, there is going to be concessionary pressure in certain kinds of buildings, in certain kind of markets. I will tell you that you could have a building in a market like New York or San Francisco or Boston where rents are holding and concessions are not going up. And there may be two buildings next door they have a lot of available space and they're being very aggressive about how they are positioning their space.  So it's going to be very, very different from building-to-building and from submarket-to-submarket. But if you wanted to have a broad general comment about overall levels across the country, across major markets, I think you're going to see a continuation of these conditions for a period of time. Derek Johnston : Okay. That makes sense. So how would you describe the pipeline today versus pre-COVID and I guess more importantly versus pre-COVID, you know maybe versus 3Q or 4Q of 2020 and you know what levels are we at today versus prior? Owen Thomas : So, I'm not sure what you mean by pipeline, but what I said earlier in my comments was that in New York City we have more tours that occurred in the first three months in X number of days of April in 2021 than we had in 2020, and more importantly than we had in 2019, okay, that\u2019s our portfolio. I don't think obviously you can make that same characterization for the market in general. We have a lot of activity going on right now across the Boston Property portfolio and it feels not too dissimilar from what it would have been in 2019 with one exception. That exception is we are not negotiating any large leases with new office tenants on new buildings, okay, and that's a meaningful different right, that was a big driver of our volumes over the last few years as the team you know led by Ray in Washington DC and the team led by Bryan in Boston, you know they did leases with Verizon and with Litos and with Fannie Mae and with Marriott, right. We are seeing any of the office new developments in our portfolio at the moment. So I\u2019d say that\u2019s the one substantive change between where we are today and where we are pre-COVID. Derek Johnston : Thanks Doug. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just first one on, I think you made a comment in San Francisco, maybe within the region, you're seeing sort of half the tenants looking for expanding or half the tenants contracting. Could you maybe just give it a bit more color on those comments? And in the past just related to that you compared and contrasted or I should say ranked markets in terms of rent growth expectations. Could you maybe just compare and contrast San Francisco versus New York? Owen Thomas : So, you know as I said, you know in our portfolio with regard to the transaction we are working on, we're seeing about half of the tenants growing and half of the tenants you know shrinking a little bit, I mean and these are again, these are all deals that are under our floor, that's what we're working on. So these are modest increases up or down.  There is no rental rate growth in San Francisco and there is no rental rate growth in New York in either market today. I would tell you that the condition in New York relatively speaking are a little bit stronger than they are in San Francisco, because again I hate to be a broken record, San Francisco is behind New York in its relative pandemic recovery. New York has been up and running, people being able to go to work, people started to do things for a nine-plus months and San Francisco really didn't open up until, call it March. So it\u2019s just you know \u2013 it\u2019s just been slower going, but we are as I said when I described, you know the sublet activity that we are experiencing on the space \u2013 piece of space set is available at 680 Folsom Street, which is a fabulous piece of space. There are a lot of tours form technology companies that are looking at that space. So it\u2019s slowly starting to happen in San Francisco, but it's behind New York City relative to the recovery. Vikram Malhotra : Got it, and just to clarify, so is the office utilization or census lower in San Francisco than New York? Owen Thomas : Yes. They are marginally, like 50% of what we currently are at. So if we're running a 20%-plus in New York City, we are running at 10%-plus at San Francisco. Vikram Malhotra : Got it. And then you know I think the broad announcement on BXP\u2019s plan to go carbon neutral, I think it's 2025, it\u2019s really interesting and probably ahead of many of your peers. I'm just wondering if you can give us a bit more color, what does the company need to do maybe from a spend perspective or strategy perspective to achieve that and from a operational perspective, getting to carbon neutral, do you think that brings some benefit. Mike LaBelle : I'll start and Doug may have some comments on this too. I think three pieces, one is in reducing the energy intensity of our assets which we have been doing for years. We are down roughly 30% already off of 2008 base year and that\u2019s improving and electrifying equipment in our building, as well as some mixing in some new building.  Second is, converting our power sources from brown to green, and we've been doing that with some limited increases in costs, but I've described them as limited and that's probably gotten like another third away there. I think we will accomplish this goal. We\u2019ll continue to turn the dial, both in terms of energy intensity and green power and then we may have to do some off to accomplish the final goal. There is some costs associated with it, but I wouldn't say it material relative to the overall results of the company and we think increasingly it's important to be a leader in this area. Again, I always say it's the right thing to do, but it's also a smart thing to do, because our customers care about it, certainly our city do, we are all in coastal cities. They're increasingly concerned about this topic, many have their own regulations.  Our capital providers care about it. As you know Vikram we\u2019ve seen more and more shareholder at ESG Conferences. We did a green bond recently where we thought we got some small benefit from offering a green bond, and I can tell you our employees certainly care a lot about it. So that's the plan and that's why we're doing it. Vikram Malhotra : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Blain, your line is open. Blaine Heck : Sorry about that. Can you just talk a little bit about \u2013 more about LA in general and Santa Monica in particular. It seems like the west side of LA has been a particularly high amount of sublease come to the market, and while it's great to see you guys get the Roku lease signed and I think you mentioned another lease you co-signed. Given that you guys are pretty substantial occupancy drop at both assets in LA this quarter, can you just touch on whether you think that sublease space is competitive to your vacancy or is it mostly opportunistic like Doug was describing?  And then can you talk about any additional prospect you might have, the profile of those tenants that might be kicking the tires in that market and any thoughts on expected timing to getting those assets back to stabilized occupancy. Owen Thomas : So Ray, do you and John want to take that one? Ray Ritchey : John, why don\u2019t you start and I\u2019ll provide any further commentary. John Powers : Sure. So the first the commentary of the sublet market, there are a decent amount of both, small blocks and large blocks available. And as Doug mentioned, many of which are quite opportunistic. We have some opportunistic sublet space in our portfolio here, but if you go ask the decision makers, our customers, they\u2019ll tell you that yes, this space is on the sublet market, but we want to be open and flexible in case we capture a sublet tenant.  If they come across someone that could backfill part of their space, it doesn't necessarily mean that they're going away. They just might need to downsize or rearrange. So I think that we see a lot of the competing sublet spaces out there that are not actually directly competitive with us and the other West Side landlords.  As it relates to you know kind of what we\u2019re structuring with our prospective tenants right now, we're seeing it to be the story of the has and the has not\u2019s. Depending on the industry and the sector, you've got technology entertainment and content companies that are continuing to grow in a big way. If you look at what we've done with Snapchat and a couple of the leases that we signed over at Colorado Center and the expansion that Doug mentioned with our existing tenant at Colorado, these groups are growing and they are looking to grow right now. And so we're excited about the prospect of that, while we're being mindful of the need to potentially switch the space and really kind of focus on. Ray, I\u2019ll turn it over to you. I don\u2019t want to be cognizant or commentary of what you're seeing and what you are \u2013 what we are seeing from our tech tenants. Ray Ritchey : Okay, well I would just say that, that Colorado Center, I mentioned earlier flight to quality with another reference, but we're saying the same at Colorado Center. We are currently, what? 90% occupied and I think with the activity we see in the last three or four weeks, we could easily be 100% leased there within the next six months. You know Santa Monica Business Park is a little bit different, a little older product. We just lost a tenant that decided to shipped out of the center, but the internal demand from our existing tenants led by Snap and others, we're quite confident that that Park will return to a fully stabilized point very soon.  And I've seen, you know relative to reference to other markets, I think the west LA market may have had a pause, but it's coming back very strong, led by the same tech sectors that John just elaborated on and not a lot of new supplies coming on and Colorado Center and Santa Monica business park are really strong market leaders and how we are respected by both, the tenants in the markets and the brokers. John Powers : I would add that the proposals that we're putting out there to the tech, media and content firms, net effective rates, you know the face rates are basically right there and the net effect of rates are very close to what we're seeing pre-COVID. And there is renewed activity in the first quarter on our prospect list, and they're coming from the credit tenants. We do a lot of start-up companies that are taking a look, that have ventured backed and growing here in West LA, but the other companies, you know the large scale tech firms and the large scale content firms, it's a bit of a race to lock down the quality space and so we're fortunate to have the Class A space that we deal in West LA. While we do see a lot of the other kind of B and B-minus space aggregate these sublet blocks that we don't think are that competitive to what we have here. Blaine Heck : Great, that's very helpful. Thanks John and Ray. Second question is just on the demand for life science outside of Boston and South San Francisco, and I guess what gave you the confidence to go ahead with three speculative developments or redevelopments there? I understand that they are smaller building than you guys are typically constructing, but to go ahead with three of them at the same time seems like a lot. So can you just talk a little bit more about your prospects or lease up at those projects and maybe more importantly, do you have any concerns related to the supply in the life science segment of the market? Dough Linde : This is Dough, I'll start. So the most important life science markets in the country by far are Cambridge, Waltham, Lexington, Boston and South San Francisco, Brisbane. It\u2019s not even a \u2013 there is not even a close start. And it is the \u2013 the markets are being led by demand growth, and it\u2019s the demand growth that gives us the comfort to be able to start these buildings on a specular basis, with a relatively short delivery time frame, because they are fully permitted and we have construction drawings and we did the costs, so we know exactly what the cost side will look like and we know what the delivery time is going to look like.  And again, we literally just started the foundation 751 and we have two RFPs that we\u2019re responding to, and that\u2019s the showy market and similarly as soon as we announced that we were going forward with 880, we've been having about a tour a week, we've already actually responded to two proposals. We have two more proposals that are coming in over the next couple of days that I'm told.  It\u2019s just that demand is there, because the drug discovery and the changes in the way capital is flowing into the life science sector, particularly into new compound development and new technologies for compound development is concentrated in the two parts of the country, and there is just great demand and it\u2019s the demand Blain that\u2019s creating the confidence that we have to do what we're doing, relatively speaking on a specular basis. We are also considering on markets that have, I don't know, the vacancy rate for lab space in Boston that\u2019s under 5% and it's probably in the 5% to 7% range in the South San Francisco Brisbane market when you add in all the space that\u2019s been committed on the new development. Blaine Heck : So no real concerns on the supplies there? Owen Thomas : Not in the next couple of years. Mike LaBelle : Look, obviously before we made these investments, we studied carefully not only the requirement that were in the market, but also the forecast deliveries and we do think that demand far outweighs the supply. The other thing I\u2019d just add to Dough comments too, you know there are three project, they are 2G Graphic locations and the Waltham assets actually are different too, because one they're on different schedules. The lab conversion deal can be delivered for tenant build out next year, rather for ground up is the year following. So that also creates a different demand environment. Blaine Heck : Great! Very helpful. Thank you both. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Dilts with UBS. Brent Dilts : Hey guys, thanks. Just one question for me at this point in the call, but maybe you could talk about what impact you think some of the current federal and local tax proposals might have on your tenant base and the leasing market if they get enacted, just given some of your key markets are already high tax jurisdictions. Thanks. Owen Thomas : I'll start with that. So look, I guess the most important one that I would point to is the increased taxes in New York State, and the reason I'm pointing that is because it actually happened. You know everything else is conjecture at this point and as we know plans don\u2019t always turn into legislation.  So look, I do think that you know higher taxes are not great for business. I do think that in New York it does impact a smaller portion of the population, because it's primarily the high earning population which is not a large percentage of people. And a lot of the employers that are attracted to New York are employing broader parts of the population that are not necessarily impacted by those tax increases, but it's certainly not a lot of positive overall for business. And then at the federal level again, you know these are all plans, nothing has been inactive. Those things that we are paying attention to are obviously the capital gains tax change, the increase in taxes for high earners, again both of those are going to impact a pretty small percentage of the population. Don't really have a geographic overlay, because it impacts the entire country.  Then the other one that's in the most recent Biden plan is repeal of Licon [ph] exchange, and you know this has been talked about before by federal legislatures, legislators and it generally doesn't pass. And I think at the end of the day a lot of the Licon exchange transactions just don't occur if you get rid of the Licon exchange benefit, so. But we'll just have to see you know how that plays itself through the entire system.  The other thing that we hear is being discussed in Washington is the repeal of the salt exemption cap. Again, I have no idea, we have no idea whether something like that would pass. If it did, it would clearly be beneficial to our footprint. Brent Dilts : Great! That\u2019s it from me. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of a Omotayo Okusanya with Mizuho. Your line is open. Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Ismail with Green Street. Daniel Ismail : Great! Thank you. Looks like you mentioned requirements not changing due to the pandemic or at least not changing thus far. Does that include changes on densification due to health concerns or is that too early to tell us well? Owen Thomas : We haven't seen anybody reduce their density because of health concerns per se, as John said that nobody had pulled a building permit. Yeah, I think it's pretty clear that a lot of companies are being a little bit more thoughtful as they buy new furniture, and they configure space going forward that the spatial separation of people that are in open office areas will be slightly more generous, which obviously is a tail wind to our business because it means people will need more space. But honestly it's not a significant factor at the moment. Daniel Ismail : Makes sense and then Doug, you mentioned parking starting to pick back up and some these ancillary revenue streams, generally picking up in the back half of the year and to recognize that it\u2019s a small portion of your overall business, but how does pricing compare to pre-COVID levels. You know has there been any degradation in parking rates so the revenue associated with a certain parking spot today versus per-COVID? Owen Thomas : Yes, so the answer is no Danny, we have not changed our pricing on any of our ancillary parking review in particular on the monthly cost. Our monthly spot is a monthly spot and I mean, look we know that we will get to a point where we're not going to have parking availability for people.  I don't know if that's going to happen in July, September or October, but they're going to be a point where we're going to have more demand for monthly basis and we have monthly basis to sell, and that's obviously a good thing for our revenue, it\u2019s just a question of when.  But we're also not going to raise prices to push demand off. We are in this for the long term. We generally look at our parking revenue pricing model once a year, early in the year and we stick with it and we don't, it's not a dynamic pricing model where based upon particular demand, we reduce or increase our pricing on hourly or a monthly basis. Daniel Ismail : And then, just last one from me, going back to the carbon neutral commitment, how many tenants or potential tenants are demanding some level of ESG requirements. I\u2019m trying to get a sense of how large the competitive advantage that 2025 carbon neutral commitment is verses some of your peers and the rest of the market. Owen Thomas : I think that\u2019s very hard to quantify. I mean I just start with saying there's no way it\u2019s ever a negative and I think there are segments of our customer base, some of it industry driven, some of it city driven that are not as concerned or focused on ESG factors with the building or the landlord and then there are other sectors and locations where they are hyper focused on it and it\u2019s a reason they make a decision. So you know it's always hard to quantify that in terms of rent. I think certainly seeing the lease up has helped by, but again it's hard to quantify.  The other thing I would say is, it\u2019s only going to get better or it's only going to become a bigger issue and we're already seeing it, every year we talk about. You know we\u2019ve been doing this for years and every year we talk about sustainability at ESG, the focus on it from our customers and other constituents just goes up every year. Daniel Ismail : Makes sense. Thanks a lot. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I will now like to turn the call back over to the speakers for any closing remarks. Owen Thomas : No closing remarks. Thank you, all, everyone for your interest in Boston Properties. That concludes the call. Operator : This concludes today's Boston Properties conference call. Thank you again for attending and have a good day!",

I'd like to welcome Owen Thomas, Chief Executive Officer; Doug Linde, President; and Mike LaBelle, Chief Financial Officer. During the Q&A portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, Senior Executive Vice President; and our regional management teams will be available to address questions. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks. Owen Thomas : Okay. Thank you, Sara, and good morning, everyone. I'm delighted to report that for the first time since the pandemic, I'm together with Doug, Mike, Sara and our Boston team for this earnings call, and all BXP employees returned to the office on July 6. BXP is emerging from the pandemic with strength and momentum as evidenced by improving financial results and rapidly elevating leasing and investment activity. This morning, I will cover the economic recovery that is underway in the U.S.; BXP's momentum in terms of financial results and leasing; private equity capital market conditions, particularly for office real estate; and BXP's capital allocation activities focusing on 4 new investments we announced this quarter, including our official entry into several new markets. So the U.S. economy, awash with fiscal and monetary stimulus, is roaring back as we exit the pandemic. U.S. GDP growth was 6.4% in the first quarter and predicted to be higher for the second quarter and for all of 2021. Over 850,000 jobs were created in June, and aggregate unemployment decreased to 5.9%. Industries that use offices have been less impacted by the pandemic and the employment rate for their workers is lower. Despite the annual inflation rate rising to 5.4% in June, the 10-year U.S. treasury rate has dropped to around 1.3% and the Federal Reserve's rhetoric remains succinctly dovish, given it believes recent inflation is driven by transitory factors. High economic growth and low interest rates create the ideal environment for strong real estate investment performance. Now BXP's financial results for the second quarter reflect the impacts of this recovery and an increasingly favorable economic environment. Our FFO per share this quarter was $0.10 above market consensus and $0.12 above our own forecast, which Mike will detail shortly. We completed 1.2 million square feet of leasing, more than double the volume we achieved in the first quarter and only 10% below our long-term second quarter averages. Our clients are making long-term commitments, the leases signed in the second quarter at a weighted average term of 7.5 years. Many are expanding as was the case with 2 large media and tech clients in L.A. And building quality is increasingly important as evidenced by strong tour and leasing activity at the GM Building, Reston Town Center, Colorado Center and the view floors at Embarcadero Center. We believe this activity and performance supports our repeatedly stated position that tenants are committed to the office as their location of choice to collaborate, innovate and train all critical for their long-term success and that concerns about the work-from-anywhere impact on the BXP footprint are overstated. Moving to private equity market conditions. $15.7 billion of significant office assets were sold in the second quarter, flat to last quarter, up 77% from the second quarter a year ago and down approximately 44% from 2019 pre-pandemic levels, and it remains 23% of commercial real estate transaction activity. Cap rates are arguably declining for assets with limited lease rollover and anything life science related, given lower interest rates. Notably in Cambridge this last quarter, a REIT agreed to purchase Charles Park vacant, though, with identified tenants for $815 million or $2,200 a square foot. Also One Memorial Drive in Cambridge, a fully-leased 409,000 square foot office asset, is under agreement to sell for $825 million or over $2,000 a square foot and a 3.8% initial cap rate. Moving to BXP's capital market activity. We had a very active and successful quarter with acquisitions. All of the investment strategies we have described to you over the last several quarters are represented in the 4 new investments we recently announced, which aggregate almost 2 million square feet. These strategies are : grow in life sciences, enter the Seattle market, acquire high-quality assets that need redevelopment or refreshment at discounted valuations due to the pandemic; and acquire office assets in partnership with private equity investors through a joint venture investment program we set up with GIC and CPP, 2 leading global real estate investors. So let's start with our official entry into the Seattle region with the acquisition of Safeco Plaza. We have previously discussed the Seattle areas having a strong real estate market as well as a logical expansion region for BXP's gateway strategy. The Puget Sound region is the headquarters location for leading global employers like Amazon and Microsoft and has one of the largest clusters of computer science workers in the U.S. Seattle has experienced high levels of population and rent growth, given its expanding technology and life science employment base, and is much more affordable than other major technology markets, given no state of Washington income taxes and lower real estate costs for both office space and housing. Rent, land values and building values are lower in Seattle than any of our other core gateway markets. The broader Puget Sound market has the scale and growth potential to afford us opportunities to both acquire and develop in multiple districts of Seattle, Bellevue and other Eastside markets. We have had a BXP executive, Kelley Lovshin, who's joined the call this morning, based in Seattle for well over a year. We have an attractive pipeline of additional investment opportunities currently under review and will build out a full-service real estate execution team over time. Safeco Plaza comprises 800,000 square feet, has a LEED-Platinum certification and is located in the center of the Seattle CBD with convenient access to rail, ferry and highway transit option. The building is currently 90% leased with 6 years of weighted average lease term at rents that are approximately 30% below market. Safeco Plaza offers generous ceiling heights, 360-degree views and timeless architectural features. And our strategy is to refresh the ground plane lobby and amenities and re-lease the building at market rates in the coming years. Liberty Mutual, which acquired Safeco, is the anchor tenant leasing 68% of the building. BXP will own either 51% or 33.3% of the property, depending on whether 1 or 2 private equity investors join the partnership. We believe our basis in the acquisition, which is $465 million or $581 a square foot, is very favorable relative to replacement costs and recent office trading activity in the Seattle market. We believe Safeco Plaza to be a very attractive investment opportunity with a future redevelopment play, given the quality and location of the building, our going-in basis as well as the cash flow we receive from existing tenants during the refreshment process. We have a nonrefundable deposit posted and intend to close the acquisition in early September. We are also entering a new submarket for BXP, Midtown South in New York City with the acquisition of 360 Park Avenue South. Midtown South has become New York's strongest submarket in terms of rent growth and vacancy, given it is the preferred location for many technology occupiers, New York City's most rapidly growing business segment. 360 Park Avenue South comprises 450,000 square feet and is in a prime location at the corner of 26th Street, 1 block from Madison Square Park. The transaction will close and the building will be vacated by a long-term corporate user later this year, which provides us the opportunity to plan in advance and subsequently execute a complete refreshment of the building. With generous ceiling heights and a unique elevator configuration, allowing for 2 separate dedicated lobbies, we believe the building will appeal to both large and medium-sized users seeking marketing and brand expression opportunities with their space. In terms of economics, we're paying $300 million for the building or $667 a square foot, which leaves us significant latitude relative to comparable sales to budget generous building enhancements. The acquisition structure is also creative and we think favorable for BXP. Consideration for the purchase will be the assumption of a $202 million mortgage on the property and the issuance of $98 million of OP units in BXP's operating partnership. We are committed to complete the transaction on December 1 of this year, and the number of OP Units issued at closing will be determined by BXP stock price at that time, but with a floor of $111 a share. In other words, we would benefit by issuing fewer units if our share price continues to rise through the closing date, but our downside is capped by a floor. Most importantly, the tax deferral inherent in our contribution structure distinguished our proposal such that it did not have to be the highest price to yield the seller the highest after-tax value. One of our joint venture investment program partners will likely join this investment by funding all of the capital needed for the refreshment resulting in their owning up to a 50% interest in the project over time. Next on acquisitions, we added to our life science business and entered the Montgomery County, Maryland life science market through the acquisition of a 7-building 435,000 square foot office park located in close proximity to the Shady Grove Life Sciences Center, the premier cluster for life sciences in the Washington, D.C. region. Montgomery County is the fourth largest life science market in the U.S. and home or proximate to several large biomedical institutions such as NIH, FDA, John Hopkins University and the University of Maryland. The 4 million square foot Shady Grove submarket at the epicenter is currently 3% vacant with rising rents. We are paying $116.5 million for the asset or $267 a square foot and intend to convert the entire park to lab and life science use over time. There are 7 buildings in total, 3 of which are vacant and will be converted to lab immediately. The remaining 4 buildings are 63% leased and will be converted to lab use as leases expire and office tenants vacate over the next few years. The entire site is 31 acres and can accommodate additional ground-up development depending on demand. There is a strong backlog of space requirements in the market, and we are already competing for a large build-to-suit in addition to other requirements. We have a nonrefundable deposit posted and plan to close the acquisition in August. And lastly, in the second quarter, we completed another life science acquisition, 153 and 211 Second Avenue in Waltham, Massachusetts. These 2 existing lab buildings comprising 154,000 square feet and 100% leased to Sanofi are located immediately adjacent to our 200 West Street lab conversion property, which is almost complete and expected to deliver in the fourth quarter of this year. This was an off-market transaction completed at a price of $100 million or $650 a square foot and a 6.4% initial cap rate. Sanofi's lease is short term and below market. The site comprises 14 acres and has 120,000 square feet of additional development rights, which could be increased when combined with the excess development capacity of our adjacent 200 West Street site. Life sciences is a rapidly growing segment of our overall business. Today, Life sciences at BXP is 3 million square feet, representing 6.4% of our total revenue. We have 920,000 square feet of lab redevelopment and development projects currently underway that are experiencing strong user demand and expected to deliver in the next 36 months. And we have approximately 5.5 million square feet of future conversion and development opportunities under our control in the Cambridge, Waltham, Lexington, South San Francisco and now Montgomery County markets. Within 5 years, assuming continued strong market conditions, we could more than double the amount of BXP's revenue that is generated from the life science sector. Regarding dispositions, we have an agreement to sell our Spring Street Office Park in Lexington, Mass, for $192 million or $575 a square foot. We expect the sale to close in September as part of an exchange with the 2 life science acquisitions mentioned previously. Year-to-date, we've completed or committed to dispositions aggregating $225 million in our share of gross proceeds and are considering additional asset sales in 2021. And as a reminder on investment activities, though we did not add to or deliver from our active development pipeline this quarter, we have 4.3 million square feet of development underway that is 71% pre-leased and projected to add approximately $190 million to our NOI and 3.7% to our annual NOI growth over the next 3 years. On a final and important personnel note, John Powers, who, as you know, is the Head of our New York region, told us he would like to retire at the end of this year. We conducted a thorough external and internal search and are very excited to have Hilary Spann join BXP as an Executive Vice President. Hilary has many years of real estate, management and investment experience as a senior officer of CPP and prior at JPMorgan Investment Management, having completed $12 billion in investments in New York City alone. Hilary will join BXP after Labor Day and commence her duties as New York Regional Manager at the beginning of 2022. So in summary, we had a very active and successful second quarter with strong financial results and multiple new business wins in the leasing and investment markets. BXP has a strong growth ramp, driven by improving economic conditions and leasing activity, the recovery of our variable revenue streams, delivery of a well-leased development pipeline, completion now of 4 new acquisitions, a strong balance sheet and capital allocated from large-scale private equity partners to pursue new investment opportunities as the pandemic recedes, a rapidly expanding life science portfolio in the nation's hottest life science markets as well as low interest rates and decreasing capital costs. Finally, I want to express my sincere appreciation for the BXP team, which is back at the office, serving our clients and winning new mandates with great care, expertise and enthusiasm. Over to Doug. Douglas Linde : Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. Obviously, we have a lot to talk about on the transactional side. I'm sure there'll be some questions on that, but I do want to spend a few minutes talking about the leasing markets and the activity that we're seeing. There's certainly no question that we're on the precipice of significant change in the atmosphere around in-person work. But more announcements come out every day. The fact remains, there's still some uncertainty and there's some repetition about COVID-19, the Delta variant and whatever the next thing is going to be. So the transition period that we are now in, as many organizations like ours encourage or require their employees to come back to work, it's going to take some time. So there are going to be some ramifications to that. Many of you participated in our NAREIT meetings, and my comments this morning about impact on work from home, I think, are going to be pretty consistent with what we talked about during that conference. The impacts on space needs, they are going to really vary depending upon the size of organizations, which we like to put in 3 categories. So the first are the really large employers. And honestly, they are moving forward with plans for space based on long-term growth plans, hiring that's occurred over the last 16 months and thousands of open job requirements that they are trying to fill right now. Then you have really small organizations that are very stable. And they have all recognized that very little is going to change regarding how they utilize the real estate. Maybe some will work more from outside the office, but everyone is going to continue to have a dedicated workspace in their facilities, and they're really not impacting the amount of space they have. And then there's a third group, which is an important group. And the third group of midsized organizations or younger companies that are experiencing growth, but where it's very unclear is how their organizational culture is effectively going to be built, if people are or aren't in physical contact. And I think those companies are going to have to take some time to figure that out. Will it work or won't it work? And we don't believe that this is going to happen immediately. We think it's going to take 6 to 12 months. And it's going to really depend, quite frankly, on how they're doing from a competitive perspective, how are their peers doing in their industries and does it matter that they're not in contact with each other all the time. When surveyed, most employers prefer to have their teams together as much as possible to enhance efficiency and collaboration and serendipitous idea generation, et cetera, while many employees declare their preferences for some or more remote work. Well, with a tight labor market, employers are acknowledging the reality. There will be an increase of work that takes place outside the office, and this will incrementally moderate some space growth in the short term. But these same companies may over time add collaborative spaces to accommodate their teams when they're all getting together, and they may eventually decide that people need to be back more frequently. Unlike any other prior recession, there have been thousands and thousands of new positions created and there are lots and lots of job openings across the service sectors, the technology sectors, the life science sectors, the generators of office demand in our markets. And we believe many of these jobs are going to lead to space absorption over the coming years. Employees are returning to their offices with very few reminders of COVID restrictions, and they're getting together formally in meeting rooms and collaboration areas, and they're taking the time to reconnect their breakfast and lunch and dinner in restaurants. In many of our CBD assets, we have access control, so we can sort of see what's been going on in our competitive building set. So comparing to February of 2020 in New York City, about 50% of the employees who had cards are now coming to the office at least once a week. And that number is about 34% in Boston and 20% in San Francisco. So it's very different from market to market. Our sequential parking income grew about 20% from the first quarter. And while we've not seen monthly parking permits pick up, tenants are driving in and paying for daily parking. We actually think that monthly parking permits will be a good indicator for the increase of office frequency in Boston and San Francisco. In Boston, true transient parking is actually up, and we've actually had to close portions of the Prudential Center garage around lunchtime every day during a couple of days in July due to lack of capacity, believe it or not. At Embarcadero Center, we've seen about a 20% pickup from the low point on monthly parking, but we're still only at 60% of our historical high. So we have a long ways to go on parking. We expect to see improvements during the rest of the year. And at the end of the year, we think we're going to be at about 70% of where we were in 2019 on a full year comparative basis. As you listen to the apartment company calls, you're hearing about the dramatic increase in occupancy in urban areas. The employees are moving back into the cities, into those same apartments, which, by the way, didn't grow during the pandemic. And so unlikely they're planning on working at home in those apartments on a frequent basis. And we're seeing this in our portfolio as we move from 51% occupancy in January to 82% at the Hub House project, that's the Hub on Causeway project, from 10% to 41% at Skyline in Oakland and from 79% to 93% at Reston Signature. And then our restaurant activity is up materially and only is really being limited now by the challenges that the operators are having with labor, both in the front and the back of the house. We have begun to move away from percentage rent assistance to our retail tenants and back to contractual fixed rent. Believe it or not, in Reston, we actually had a tenant request a modification back to fixed rent because the percentage rent was creating a higher payment to us. Sublet space continues to be a major topic during many of our conversations with investors. Last quarter, I described the dynamics of opportunistic sublet space and discussed our belief that many of the visceral announcements made by tenants that we're putting space on the market would reverse as organizations begin to plan their in-person work strategy again. This quarter at 535 Mission, a tech company without subletting any space, withdrew 40% of their 100,000 square foot availability. In Manhattan, CBRE is reporting that there has been a drop of about 5.9 million square feet out of a total of 19.3 million square feet that was put on post-COVID, and about 67% of that was backfilled by the prime tenant. Yes, there is a lot of sublet space on the market, but a large portion is going to be reoccupied. Some is not actionable because of short terms. It has unworkable existing conditions or, quite frankly, users just don't like the comfort of the lessor's profile. And some of it is getting leased, like the 3 floors that were completed at 680 Folsom in San Francisco that Macys.com had on a sublet market. The headwinds from sublet space exists, but they are going to dissipate as companies begin to come back to work. Now as I pivot my remarks to the Boston Properties office and life science portfolio specifically, I'm going to describe a level of activity that I think is counter to the headlines of weak market conditions across the office sector in the United States. The BXP portfolio includes a number of iconic, high-quality, well-maintained and continually upgraded assets. When there is market weakness, our assets outperform. We spent a lot of time discussing our portfolio vacancy last quarter and our forward expectations. We experienced quicker-than-expected revenue commencement on signed leases and saw basically flat vacancy relative to the prior quarter. We were down 10 basis points on a 45 million square foot portfolio. And this included taking back 66,000 square feet of nonrevenue space that I talked about last quarter at The Hub on Causeway from the cinema that had never opened. We now have new signed leases for 640,000 square feet of space that have yet to commence and are not included in our occupied in-service portfolio. So on a relative basis, here's my view of the markets, and I'm making it based upon activity in the portfolio, active lease negotiations, tours, RFPs from best to least. Boston Waltham, we don't have any available space in Cambridge, so we have no activity there. San Francisco CBD, Northern Virginia, Midtown Manhattan, Peninsula, Silicon Valley, West L.A., Princeton and finally, D.C. CBD. All the transactions I'm going to talk about are post-COVID negotiations, meaning they all began in the latter half of '20 or into 2021. So just to change things up this quarter, let's start with L.A. Last quarter, I acknowledged our disappointment that we were unable to keep a 200,000 square foot tenant at the Santa Monica Business Park. Less than 30 days later, we had a signed lease for 140,000 square feet of that space to a growing tech company. During May, we completed a 350,000 square foot long-term extension and expansion at Colorado Center with a media company. In total, this 490,000 square feet had a weighted average expiring rent that was effectively equal to the starting rent of that space, and 200,000 square feet of the expiring rents were at above-market holdovers. This follows our immediate release of the 70,000 square feet vacancy that we had from a defaulting tenant in the first quarter. We have a number of smaller deals in negotiation in Santa Monica Business Park, and we're responding to requests from tenants that would prefer to go direct on some of the sublet availability at Colorado Center. In Boston, during the second quarter, in the CBD, we signed 6 leases totaling 55,000 square feet, and the average rent starting represented a gross roll-off of about 20%. In each case, the tenant was either renewing or expanding. We have 7 additional leases in the works totaling 70,000 square feet. Obviously, most of them are small, since we don't have much in the way of availability in our Boston portfolio. In the suburban Boston portfolio, we completed 60,000 square feet. The average weighted cash rent on those leases was up 17%. Life science organizations are dominating activity in this market. We commenced construction on 880 Winter Street, that's the lab life science renovation that we're doing in Waltham, and have signed an LOI for 16,000 square feet. We started the building on July 5 and are exchanging proposals with over 180,000 square feet of tenants for the 220,000 square foot building, and it will be delivering in August of next year. We've been responding to new inquiries just about every week on that space. Asking rents in the market for lab space are in the high 60s to mid-70s triple net, which are well above our underwriting when we planned this project about 15 months ago. Many of you have been asking about inflation and construction costs. When we do our construction budgeting, we always include an escalation expectation. So those numbers are baked into those numbers in our supplemental. It varies depending upon the labor market conditions, subcontractor availability and material costs. We bid and our on budget for both 880 Winter Street and 180 CityPoint. So we figured out what the escalation would be and we hit it. Currently, we're carrying about a 4% to 6% escalation for base building jobs that we would bid in 12 months. Now turning back to leasing. In Waltham, we're negotiating leases for another 70,000 square feet of space with life science companies at Bay Colony, that's adjacent to 880 Winter Street, and our Reservoir Place building. Our new acquisitions at 211, 153 Second, which Owen described, have a lease expiration in the late '22, and the current rental rates on the space are dramatically below market. The expirations will land right in the sweet spot of the current demand in the Boston and the Waltham and the Lexington submarkets. There is some pure office demand in the market. And with more and more buildings being converted to life science, we actually expect the office market is going to tighten dramatically over the next few years. In New York, we continue to have significantly more tours than we had in comparable periods in 2019, and the second quarter is actually up significantly on a sequential basis from the first. We completed 10 office leases totaling 90,000 square feet, including another full floor expansion at 399. In total, gross rents on leases signed this quarter were about 20% lower than the in-place rents. We are negotiating over 400,000 square feet of additional leases, including almost 250,000 square feet at Dock 72. The majority of the New York City leases will be for terms in excess of 10 years, and we include 2 more expanding tenants at 399 Park Avenue. Activity at the street plane of the buildings is also picking up. We signed up a new fitness provider at 601 Lex, a new fast casual restaurant at 399. And we're negotiating a lease for all of the available restaurant base at Times Square Tower, and we plan on opening The Hugh culinary collective at 601 Lexington in September. In Reston, our buildings continue to have extensive activity. This quarter, we completed over 170,000 square feet of leasing, of which more than 100,000 square feet was on vacant space. In addition, we have active negotiations on another 72,000 square feet, including almost 60,000 square feet of currently vacant space. Reston Next is moving towards completion with the first tenant expected to take occupancy by the end of 2021. We have another 85,000 square feet of office renewals in negotiation in Springfield, Virginia. Retail leasing is roaring back in Reston Town Center. We've negotiated 35,000 square feet of restaurant transactions and have almost 100,000 square feet of cinema, fitness and soft good transactions in the Town Center. Pedestrian activity in Reston Town Center is as active as any location in our portfolio. Office rents are basically flat to slightly down on the re-let, since the expiring cash rents have been contractually increasing by 2.5% to 3% for the last 10 years. In San Francisco CBD, we completed 5 transactions totaling 54,000 square feet with an average roll up of 8%. Why is it so low this quarter? While the square footage was impacted by a full floor transaction, it starts in the mid-90s where the tenant elected to forgo any TIs for a lower rent. If you exclude that transaction, the mark-to-market would have been 17%. In addition, we have 8 active lease negotiations involving 143,000 square feet with an average rent starting of over $100 a square foot. That's over $100 a square foot in this purportedly terrible market in San Francisco. The bulk of these spaces are in the higher floors in Embarcadero Center, and they all have used. Pedestrian activity at the street plane, particularly in the CBD of San Francisco, has improved over the last quarter, but it's still well behind Boston, Reston and New York. And this has affected tenants' appetite for making space decisions. However, medium-sized technology users have begun to look for space. Sublease absorption has picked up in the city with about 1 million square feet of withdrawals or completed transactions. And as I said earlier, Macys.com did 104,000 square feet at 680 Folsom, our building. In Mountain View, we continue to see a constant flow of medical device and alternative energy and automotive and other R&D users looking for space. We completed a full building lease with an energy company with a healthy 60% markup in rent. And we have another 21,000 square foot lease in negotiation. There are some large tech tenants in the market today looking for expansion space, and one recently executed leases for about 700,000 square feet of availability that was in Santa Clara. We are certainly pursuing those tenants for Platform 16, and we have begun internal discussions about the appropriate time for the speculative restart of this building. So to summarize, our leasing activity in the second quarter accelerated. Our portfolio is in great shape in L.A. We continue to see strong economic transactions in the CBD of Boston, our suburban Boston portfolio and the CBD of San Francisco. We have significant activity in Reston and are covering our vacancy. New York tour activity is strong. We're doing deals, but economic terms are weaker. We are expanding our life science investments across the company. And in Greater Boston and South San Francisco, our new construction is seeing strong demand at escalating rents. Mike? Michael LaBelle : Thank you, Doug. I'm going to start my comments by describing our earnings results, which, as Owen mentioned, significantly beat our expectations. We reported FFO for the quarter of $1.72 per share, which is $0.12 per share better than the midpoint of our guidance. About $0.06 of our outperformance came from earlier-than-anticipated leasing and better parking, retail and hotel performance, which I would consider core revenue outperformance. The other $0.06 is from unbudgeted termination income and expense deferrals that we expect to incur in the third quarter. Our office portfolio beat our expectations by approximately $0.02 per share from accelerated leasing. We had several larger leases commence earlier than we expected, including our 350,000 square foot renewal and expansion with a large media tenant in L.A., a 65,000 square foot health care firm in suburban Boston and 3 technology tenants in Reston totaling over 100,000 square feet. All of these leases were in our full year assumptions and were completed faster than we anticipated. Leasing in our residential portfolio also improved this quarter, exceeding our revenue projections by $0.01. The improvement was across the board with our stabilized residential buildings exceeding our occupancy assumptions by 100 to 200 basis points and the recently delivered projects at The Hub House in Boston and Skyline in Oakland seeing even stronger absorption. While market rents continue to be below pre-pandemic levels, concessions are starting to dissipate. Our parking, hotel and retail income exceeded our expectations by $0.03 per share. As Doug detailed, these components of our income stream have started to improve, which should continue as activity levels grow in our cities. The other 2 areas where we exceeded expectations were in termination income and lower operating expenses. Our termination income totaled $6.1 million, which was $0.03 above our budget. It came from 2 sources. First, at 399 Park Avenue, the building is full, and we have more demand than available space. This quarter, we were able to accommodate one of our expanding financial services tenants by recapturing 50,000 square feet from another tenant. The transaction resulted in $2 million of termination income in the quarter. And second, we received about $4 million in unexpected settlement income from tenants who defaulted on their leases last year. We categorized this as termination income. While we anticipate a modest amount of termination income every quarter, we do not assume receiving any additional settlement income this year. Finally, in our operating expense line, our maintenance expenses came in $0.03 per share lower than we anticipated. We've deferred these costs and expect it will be incurred in the third quarter. One other item I'd like to point out is that we reported second quarter same property NOI growth of 8.9% on a GAAP basis and 7.5% on a cash basis over the second quarter 2020. The strong increase, honestly, is primarily due to the charges for accrued rent and accounts receivable we took in 2020 related to tenants impacted by the pandemic. If you net out last year's charges, our GAAP same-property NOI dropped by 1% year-over-year due to lower occupancy. However, our cash same-property NOI grew by 3.8% year-over-year, as free rent periods expired, and we've converted those to cash rents in 2021. This quarter's leasing statistics also require explanation. The total company in New York City leasing in particularly were negatively impacted by 2 retail leases in New York City. Excluding retail, the mark-to-market on our New York City office leases was positive 6% on a gross basis and positive 8% on a net basis. And office leases in the total portfolio demonstrated strong rental increases of 14% growth and 21% net. Now I'd like to turn to our expectations for the rest of 2021. For the third quarter, we provided guidance of $1.68 to $1.70 per share, $0.03 above consensus estimates at the midpoint. At the midpoint, our third-party guidance -- our third quarter guidance is $0.03 per share lower than our second quarter FFO. Again, this is due to the outsized termination income and expense deferrals from the second quarter. Net of those 2 items, our third quarter guidance is $0.02 to $0.04 per share higher than the second quarter. In the office portfolio, our occupancy exceeded expectations in the second quarter due to early lease commencements. For the rest of 2021, we anticipate occupancy will be relatively steady. As Doug mentioned, we have 640,000 square feet of signed leases that have not yet commenced occupancy. We expect 450,000 square feet of these leases to occupy before year-end. In addition, we have another approximate 600,000 square feet of both renewal and new leases in the works for 2021 occupancy. This activity, combined with already signed leases, are expected to cover the 1.1 million square feet of lease expirations that remain in 2021. With stable occupancy, the current run rate for the in-service portfolio is a good proxy for the rest of 2021. We are expecting consistent quarterly improvement from our other income sources, primarily from our parking and the continued lease-up of our recently delivered residential properties. Our assumptions result in $0.02 of projected incremental NOI growth from -- in the third quarter from these sources. We also expect growth from the acquisitions that Owen described. Acquisition activity, net of dispositions, will add approximately $0.01 to our third quarter NOI and $0.02 to the fourth quarter. So in summary, after adjusting for $0.06 of higher termination income and deferred expenses from the second quarter, we project our in-service portfolio for the third quarter to be higher by $0.02 at the midpoint and our net acquisition and disposition activity to contribute $0.01. While we are not delivering any developments into service in the third quarter, we anticipate incremental growth from developments in the fourth quarter that will accelerate in 2022. We anticipate that we'll start to recognize revenue as the first tenants commence the occupancy at our $270 million Hub on Causeway office tower in Boston in the fourth quarter. And by mid-'22, we expect this project that is currently 95% leased to be generating a stabilized NOI. We also expect to deliver our $50 million life science lab conversion at 200 West Street that is 100% leased in December of this year. It will be at its full run rate in 2022. Our development deliveries will accelerate and be more meaningful to our earnings growth in 2022. In addition to the deliveries in Q4 of this year, next year, we have $1.7 billion of developments slated for delivery and initial occupancy, and they're 85% leased in the aggregate. Overall, we're thrilled with our results this quarter as the markets continue to recover. Our leasing activity is exceeding our expectations. Our variable income streams are improving. Our development pipeline is on track to add future growth. And we're taking advantage of opportunities to acquire some unique assets at favorable prices that we expect will generate additional future earnings growth and value creation. Operator, that completes our formal remarks. Can you please open the line for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Alexander Goldfarb : The first question is, Mike, as you guys think about your earnings growth and dividend growth, you have the new $2 billion JV, which obviously provides a lot of capital that it lessens the need for dispositions or external -- raising external equity. So with the potential for more dispositions this year, is the BXP view that earnings growth and dividend growth will come first, meaning that dispositions will be limited in such a way that it really won't impair FFO growth? And that way, all the development and life science stuff and all the good stuff that we see will flow through into earnings next year, the year after, et cetera? Michael LaBelle : Yes. I mean, Alex, our goal is to continue to grow our earnings over time, no doubt about it. And we've got a very significant development pipeline and acquisition pipeline that we're working through to add to that growth over time that should result in additional dividend growth over time. So dispositions are a way to recycle capital. And we select assets based upon what we think their growth potential is, and we reinvest that capital into assets that we think are going to generate higher returns over time. Owen Thomas : Yes. The only thing I would add is we've been selling $200 million to $300 million of noncore assets for about 5 to 7 years, and we're running out. We have fewer of them in terms of the noncore assets. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. That doesn't sound like such a bad thing. It sounds like you've cleaned the cupboard well. The next question is the rebound in the ancillary income, meaning the parking, the hotel and the retail. I think last quarter, you guys spoke about $130 million or so of sort of missing income that was impacted by the COVID shutdowns. How much of this was back in the second quarter? And then what are your thoughts for timing of full restoration? Michael LaBelle : So the -- it was actually revenue of $130 million that we were talking about in those areas. We do have some of it back. Obviously, the hotel, which used to generate about $15 million of NOI is still losing money. So that has not -- it's improved slightly, but it hasn't improved significantly at all. And the other areas on an NOI basis, we are somewhere around $60 million to $65 million short of where we were before on the retail and the parking. Douglas Linde : Yes. Like I said -- so we're -- with the end of the year, we're going to be at about 70% of our parking revenue. So that's a meaningful number for 2022 as people really start ramping up our monthly parking again. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Stephen Sakwa : I appreciate all the detail. And Mike, you sort of talked about occupancy kind of trending flat the back half of the year. I realize it's early to really give guidance or think about '22. But when you just sort of talk to your tenants and you think about next year's expirations and you kind of look at your pipeline, I guess, I'm trying to just sort of think through when you think the occupancy really starts to ramp in the portfolio? And how long do you think it takes you to get back to what you would consider to be normal occupancy? Douglas Linde : So Steve, this is Doug. I'd answer the question in the following manner. We have relatively modest amounts of rollover in 2022. And we are covering vacancy today. The increase in our development activities that will happen in early '22 or late '21 are effectively buildings that are 100% leased. So if you look at our portfolio occupancy in the first few quarters of 2021, it will be picking up. I'm not smart enough to tell you when we're -- when we get to 92% or 93%. But that's -- I'd say that's the path we're on. We're -- today, we're very high, 88%, I think what, 88.6% this quarter. So I would hope that by the end of next year, we're going to be in the 90s again. And we may be significantly higher than that depending upon the recovery in the market, and honestly, how well we do with our life science developments. Because right now, we are developing stuff that we believe we'll deliver are 100% occupied. Owen Thomas : I think the other thing I would just add is, look, our rollover is modest. It's 6% in '22 and 5% in '23. A big chunk of it is in Boston, which is our strongest market. So we think we're going to do well there, and we're going to have roll-ups there. We also have some in San Francisco in the CBD, where again, I think we're going to see roll-ups. And as Doug described, we're already working on a lot of early renewals for '22 expirations that we think will exhibit roll-ups. There's very little in L.A. There's very little in D.C. And New York City has about 500,000 square feet in 2022. Stephen Sakwa : Okay. And then maybe secondly, I don't know if this is for Owen or Doug, just maybe a little bit more commentary on the Seattle entrants. The Safeco sounds like it's got a little bit of vacancy for you to lease up. But I'm just curious sort of what other opportunities you might be pursuing? And I assume you're looking on both sides of the lake. And I assume it would have some kind of development focus. But maybe just expand a little bit on Seattle comments. Owen Thomas : Steve, I'll start and Doug may want to jump in. As I mentioned in my remarks, I -- we have a very active pipeline of investments that we've been reviewing for probably 6 to 9 months. Kelley Lovshin, who is on the call, moved to Seattle in February of 2020. And with her help on the ground, it's been a very active pipeline. I think it's robust because it's: one, both acquisitions and development; and two, as you're suggesting, it's in multiple geographies. So we've been looking in the CBD of Seattle where Safeco is. We've been looking at South Lake Union. We've been looking at the Bellevue area and to the east of there. So -- we think there -- it's a robust pipeline, and I think we will have success in growing out our region in Seattle in the near and medium term. Douglas Linde : And regarding Safeco, Steve, look, we are not looking to buy stabilized beautiful assets that are achieving a stabilized return of 3.5% to 5%, okay? That's not what we're doing. We're looking to find assets where we can create value through our operating prowess. And if you look at Safeco Plaza, it's an 800,000 square foot building that was built in the late 60s. It's got great bones. It's got great ceiling highs. It's got great views. And it's fine from an architectural perspective in the interior, but it's not fabulous. And our goal is to do what we did at 100 Federal Street with that asset, which was make that building something that it wasn't, which was a building that tenants wanted to go to as opposed to just another nice building in a CBD that was sort of moving one way or the other with the market. And we are actually -- we've got to figure out exactly what it is we think we can do and economically how to do that. And honestly, I would say that we are -- while there is a little bit of vacancy in the building, we're not in a rush to lease the space in the building tomorrow because we want to make sure we understand what the building could become and sell what it will be, not what it is. And so we're going to be thoughtful and constructive with how we do that. And obviously, it's a weaker market today than we believe it will be in 12 months and 18 months. And we hope when we're at a point where we've done the work, the building is going to have a very different reputation and a very different positioning in the building. And we're going to use the Boston Property skill set to do that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. James Feldman : Clearly, you've become more active on the value-add investment side here. Can you just talk about how the competitive landscape is changing? And what we're likely to see in terms of people willing to make more bets on vacancy and office across your markets? Owen Thomas : Yes. I think as we described the last few quarters, we felt there will be an opportunity to pursue high-quality, but unstabilized real estate at pandemic discounts. And we think we're seeing that in the market. I think the capital for office real estate for anything that's leased with a long weighted average lease term or certainly anything life science is robust, highly competitive. I could argue cap rates are going down. And as Doug just said, that's just not -- we don't see that value creation for our shareholders. What we want to do are things like Safeco that are not stabilized, great bones. And we think the competitive landscape for those kinds of assets is less than it is for the leased assets. And I think if our thesis holds true, which we obviously think it is, which is people are going to return to the office, I think the capital will follow what we're doing. And I think those transactions will get more competitive. But Jamie, I wouldn't leave you with the impression that there are not other bidders for these assets. But as you see from our success this last quarter, we have been able to buy quite a few things. And I think that is an indicator that pricing is somewhat different for that sector of our market. James Feldman : And then how are you -- or how did you underwrite whether it's stabilized yields or IRRs? And what are you and your partners looking for at this point? Owen Thomas : Yes. We're -- look, we mark the market rents to market. If we think there's a change in market rents based on what's occurring, we underwrite that. I think we're conservative in the lease-up. I think those assumptions actually drive the bus more than anything. And we feel like we're being appropriately conservative. But over time, what we're trying to achieve is approximately a 6% NOI yield over time. Michael LaBelle : Which isn't -- that's not an IRR, right? So that's -- when we get done, we're yielding in the low 6s with growth, obviously, because there are typically escalations in rents. And if you put some leverage on that and you assume some cap rate differential between what your yield is and what you could sell it at, it gives you a healthy IRR. James Feldman : Okay. And then just a follow-up to a comment you made earlier, Doug. I think you were talking about either the Bay Area or Mountain View specifically about maybe tech -- larger tech looking for space. Can you just talk like big picture across all the markets about what we should expect to see from big tech? And clearly, they drove the market ahead of the pandemic. I'm just wondering what we might see coming out of it? Douglas Linde : I think, honestly, you're going to see very much what you saw in the 2016 to 2020 era, which is big tech is looking for really thoughtful, talented people. And they believe that the markets that they're currently in have some of those people and then there are places where they think they can expand. And so -- I mean there's a rumor that Facebook is looking for a couple of hundred thousand square feet in the Boston marketplace. We can tell you that there is a rumor that there's -- that Google and that Amazon are looking for additional space in the Silicon Valley. We see the requirements of what's happening right now in Bellevue and the amount of space that's under construction that we believe Amazon is going to be growing into. They don't announce when they do a lease, but that's the perception. So I just -- I think you're going to see more of the same. And these companies have enormous appetite for space and for talent. And whether or not antitrust impacts them from -- if it's 1 company or 2 companies or 5 companies, which obviously is a consideration, I do think that the growth is still going to be there. James Feldman : Okay. You didn't mention New York. Any thoughts there? Douglas Linde : Look, Facebook is -- put a fork in the ground in their campus, which they've done very quietly on the far west side. John Powers is on the phone. You can comment about other technology demand. I mean we've announced that -- the market knows that we're interested in doing 360 Park Avenue 2 weeks ago. And obviously, we announced it last night. We've seen a significant amount of large tech demand for that building. So I don't think that New York is at all being left behind. In fact, I think it's similar to what's been going on. Remember that in 2020, Google and Facebook took -- and Amazon took some very large pieces of space. People forget, Amazon took the entire Lord & Taylor former WeWork headquarters building, which was almost 800,000 square feet, right? Google took 1 million square feet out of 500 Washington Street. And Facebook, I think, has amassed over 1.5 million square feet in the Hudson Yards. So that just happened. So I don't think we feel any differently about New York City. John, do you have any other thoughts? John Powers : I can just tell you that at the end of June, there were 295,000 open jobs posted. Most of those in tech in New York. So we're seeing a lot of expansion here. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : On Safeco Plaza, according to media reports, the building has already undergone a fair amount of CapEx over the last 15 years, about $100 million. What do you expect in terms of capital spend to reposition the asset going forward? And can you remind us of your views on Liberty Mutual and whether or not you expect them to renew when their lease expires in 2028? Michael LaBelle : So we're not going to comment on what a tenant wants to do. Liberty Mutual purchased Safeco Insurance. Safeco Insurance has space on the sublet market. That would be an indication that they're not utilizing all their space. So that's probably an opportunity to have a conversation. With regards to what was spent on the building, almost all the capital that's been spent on the building has been on the bones of the building, not been on aesthetics, not been on place making. And that is -- that's going to be our primary focus in addition to making sure there's no deferred capital. We don't -- I don't have a budget I can give you. When we know what we're going to do and we present it to the Seattle office market, we will present it to you. John Kim : Okay. And on the co-investment program, are you looking at single asset transactions only? Or is the fund willing to look at portfolio acquisitions? And also, is there a possibility for BXP to contribute assets to fund? Owen Thomas : We are -- we would definitely look at a portfolio acquisition. As you know, we tend to aggregate our company and our portfolio one asset at a time, either through acquisition or development. But that would certainly -- portfolio acquisitions would be included. And no, we have not had discussions about joint venturing our existing assets. I want to just -- I want to clarify a word that you used that I don't think is necessarily an accurate statement about what we're doing. It's not a fund. It's a co-investment program. So every asset stands on its own. One or both or neither joint venture partner might elect to invest in a particular asset, and they're not aggregated into a \"fund.\" So I just want to clarify that because I think it's important for you to understand. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Nicholas Yulico : Doug, I appreciate you gave some color on leases signed in the quarter. Is it possible to just get the mark-to-market on those lease signings in the quarter? And I guess, as well, how we should think about what that number could look like for the back half of the year based on lease signing so far? I mean, obviously, the second quarter number was 14%. But how does that number kind of shake out for lease signings in the quarter and how it could look for the rest of the year for commencements? Douglas Linde : Well, so timing is everything. And the reason I provide you with the information I do is because it is an indication of what is going on with the spaces that we lease today, which unfortunately, may not hit our supplemental statistics from a revenue perspective for 2 quarters, 3 quarters or 6 quarters. So I'm just trying to sort of give you a flavor of what is going on, on a relative basis, right? So it's very hard to sort of predict what's going to happen because I don't know which spaces we're going to lease and what the rent was versus what the rent might be on those spaces until it happens. So again, on average, everything I said was as basically down in New York City of 20%. That doesn't mean the market is down by 20%. It may mean that those leases might have had a negative mark-to-market in 2019 because the rent went way up in a particular building and the market just never got to where the increases were. But so things were down in New York, and they were flat in Los Angeles, again, on the portfolio of space we leased based upon what was being paid and what will be paid on a cash basis. And then the other places in Boston and in San Francisco, we were up about 20%. In Mountain View, we were up 60%. And in Reston, we were down, call it, 5% to 7%. But again, a lot of the space in Reston was vacant. So it wasn't down. It's actually 100% increase because that space had been vacant for more than 12 months, right? So that's the reason that we give you what we give you in terms of the data, so you can have a sense of what's going on, on a current basis. Nicholas Yulico : Great. Very helpful. Just second question on the Midtown South purchase. Maybe you can give us a feel for rough numbers about how you're thinking about the additional redevelopment costs and potential rents you're targeting there? Douglas Linde : So let me just make a few comments, and I'll let John Powers give a more verbose answer. We -- as Owen said, we bought the building for a very attractive basis. And we're going to be in this building for well under $1,000 a square foot. I'll let John talk about where rents are. Again, we're in the early stages of figuring out exactly what it is we want to do to this building. And I'm expecting John will say it's going to depend on who shows up. Because depending upon who shows up, they may want different things for the building. John? John Powers : The building is very attractive for us because it's being delivered vacant at the end of the year. So we don't even have the carry cost for this year. We're paying for it, as Owen said, at the end of the year. And it's very difficult to get a building in that market with good bones, and this has pretty good floor plates, and also get it back all vacant at the same time. So we're in the visioning stage now of this and putting it together. We had a session yesterday. It went very well. We think we're going to do some very interesting and different things in the lobby space there. And we're -- we think there'll be a lot of interest from different types of tenants. It's very difficult to get identity if you're a 100,000-foot tenant or 150,000- or 20,000-foot tenant. Certainly, that's the case in many of our buildings, which are much larger. So this, I think, will be a very good branding opportunity, as Owen said in his comments, for some tenants. Rents, it really depends upon the size of the lease-up. And we're budgeting some downtime, obviously, next year. And we may convert quicker. We don't know how the leasing is going to go on this. But I would say if you think of something with the 9%, that would be consistent with our underwriting. And we may do better than that, and we hope we will. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi. Emmanuel Korchman : Just thinking of life sciences as a broader space, you guys are increasing your exposure there as are many other owners and developers. How should we think about sort of differentiating what you're building in overall supply versus what we're hearing in the headlines of seemingly everyone chasing life science? Owen Thomas : Yes. So I think the most important differentiation, Manny, is that we already control most of the conversion and land that we're going to develop. I mentioned in my remarks, we already have 5.5 million square feet under control. So we don't have to go out and buy anything. And all those projects are in the nation's hottest life science markets. They're in Cambridge. They're in Waltham. They're in South San Francisco. They're now in Montgomery County, Maryland. So again, we don't have to go create the raw material to build our business. We already control it. Now that being said, fortunately, this last quarter, we did find some things that we thought were interesting. We bought a smaller existing lab building that's adjacent to a project we already had in Waltham, which we thought was a terrific, attractively priced tuck-in opportunity. And then our D.C. team got very comfortable with the Montgomery County market and found a very interesting transaction to open up basically a new life science market for Boston Properties. And we're in the process of closing the deal, and we're already in discussions with a number of users for that site. So we have high hopes. So anyway, I think that's the big difference is you hear a lot of people \"getting into life science or growing in life science.\" We're going to do it by just executing on what we already control. Michael Bilerman : Owen, it's Michael Bilerman. I was wondering if I can follow up. In your opening comments, you mentioned the concerns about work-from-anywhere impact on the BXP footprint are overstated. And I wonder if you can distinguish sort of BXP relative to the whole office market. Because obviously, you've made that comment that it doesn't impact the BXP footprint, but I have to assume there's going to be some impact overall on office. Are you able to sort of tease out sort of your outperformance relative to the broader office market and why you believe it's sort of greatly overstated? Owen Thomas : Yes. Yes, Michael, I think let me answer that in 2 different -- or I'll answer just 2 different questions. Look, I think we have said we don't -- we believe there will be some impact on the office market due to work-from-anywhere, but we just think it's overstated. If you look at the recovery of the office companies relative to other property companies and overall industry, it's much lower. So clearly, the market is concerned. It's not just about Boston Properties, it's about the whole sector and what this return-to-office profile looks like for office companies. So we acknowledge that's the case. In terms of BXP's differentiation, I would say 2 things are very important. One, we like our gateway footprint. We would acknowledge that in the short term, cities in the Southeast, Southwest, they're opening more rapidly. And perhaps in the short term, they might have better performance. But we believe, over the long term, our gateway markets that are increasingly driven by tech and life sciences demand and have some barriers to entry are long term the best place to be. And then the second thing that both Doug and I talked about in our remarks is applied to quality. If you look at the tour activity in high-quality building, our tour activity in New York is much higher in terms of number of tours this year-to-date than it was in 2019. If you look at assets like the GM Building, there's a lot of not only tour activity, but leases getting signed. And as Doug said in his remarks, when you're in a soft market, people want to upgrade their buildings and they want to go to quality. I also think a lot of the future in terms of work from home is I do believe corporate leadership wants to have their employees return to the office. And one of the ways they're going to do that is to have great offices. They're going to want to be in great locations, and they're going to want to have great space in place. And that's what we try to do. Michael Bilerman : And the other question I had was, you talked a lot about sort of the employer versus the employee difference, where clearly, a lot of the surveys show that employees want significant flexibility. But obviously, when you look at the employers or CEO surveys, you get slightly different answers. With the Delta variant rising and sort of increased masking up in some of the gateway markets again, do you think that the tone with your tenants on the employer side just may be shifting a little bit sort of acknowledging we're going to be with this for a while, right? Unless the vaccination rate increases meaningfully, it's going to be hard to get rid of COVID and all the protections and things that are happening that all sort of got relaxed a little bit when we had this euphoria that we were done with COVID. Do you think it changes or slows anything down should sort of the frustration with going into the office on the employee side where sort of both of these things sort of meet the head? I'm just curious how you think about that on a current basis, given what's happening. Owen Thomas : Yes. We haven't seen much evidence of that. Our footprint, as you know, it tends to be in a more highly vaccinated parts of the country. So I think that's the first important point. I completely agree with the dynamic that you described of it, what is the employer preference and what is the employee preference. And I think that's a lot of the dynamic that's working itself out and determining office policies at this time. Look, the Delta variant could slow the recovery, but I don't think it's a matter -- I think the recovery is going to happen. So it's not an if question, it's a when question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Craig Mailman : Just, Mike, I know you gave us the kind of the impact from the acquisitions in 3Q and 4Q. But can you guys just provide some going-in cap rates that we can think about initially for the different assets? Because I know you can kind of back into it, but the timing piece as we head into '22, I just figured it might be easy on a run rate. Douglas Linde : I'd rather not give you explicit cap rates because we're -- these aren't closed and we have confidentiality agreements and such. I just would give you the following because I think this will be helpful. So 360 Park Avenue, as John Powers said, will be vacant in 2022. So I think the cap rate is obviously there. And the -- and as Owen said, the Shady Grove development, we intend to basically vacate all of those buildings as quickly as we possibly can. And so there's very little incremental income there. Safeco is a well-leased building at very below market rents. When we close, we'll be able to provide more detail on that. And I think we provided some detail on the Second Avenue and the... Michael LaBelle : 6.4%. Douglas Linde : And that's a -- if you back into that and you listen to what I said about where market rents are, you can get to where we think that's going to be in '22 when we release the building. Craig Mailman : Okay. That's helpful. And then just a clarification on 360 Park Ave South, did you guys buy the fee or the leasehold? Douglas Linde : We bought the fee interest. Michael LaBelle : We are buying the fee interest. Owen Thomas : We are buying the fee interest. Craig Mailman : And then just one last one. I've been asked a couple of times, and I'm just kind of curious myself. Is there any potential to redevelop the Cambridge Marriott into life science or office over time? Or is there something there that would stop you from doing that? If it made economic sense? Douglas Linde : So the answer is there's nothing legally preventing us from having a conversation with the hotel operator about their contract, and there's nothing that legally prevents us from going to the Cambridge City Council and ask for a change in use there. So clearly, we have been successful and other -- doing other things like that in the city of Cambridge. And again, one of the things that people sort of -- I don't think they ignore it. They just don't appreciate it. We're going to build almost 1 million square feet of new lab or office space in Kendall Square that is currently being leased at rents of between $110 and $140 a square foot triple net. We have to build a underground parking structure for the existing space, and we have to give some below-grade ground to the local utility company. But that's going to happen sooner rather than later. So we have plenty of opportunity to grow our Cambridge portfolio. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Caitlin Burrows : Earlier, you mentioned that the list of noncore disposition candidates were shrinking. So I was just wondering, as you go through these acquisitions and developments, how you generally plan on funding them? I know this quarter, you did mention the use of some OP Units in one of the cases. So would you identify other dispositions, issue equity, only do it when your cash position allows or something else? Michael LaBelle : I'll start to answer that, and then you guys can jump in if you want. Look, I mean we've got a very, very strong balance sheet, and we've got a significant amount of pre-leased developments that the money has already been spent and the income is coming in, in the next couple of years. So that balance sheet is only going to strengthen as that income comes in and brings our leverage down from a place where we're comfortable now, but bring it down to provide even more capacity. So we will continue to fund through some modest asset sales, some additional debt capital and utilizing private equity to help on any kind of acquisition type of an activity. Typically, we want to do the developments on our own unless somebody else owns the land. And that's the only way that we can access that. And we're comfortable with that strategy in the foreseeable future. That doesn't mean we would never bring in additional public equity into the company. That's really dependent on 2 things : one, the investment opportunities and profile that we think we're going to have over the next couple of years; and then obviously, what our share price is and whether we think that's an attractive cost of capital for us. So we look at all of those things when we think about funding future investments. Douglas Linde : So just to sort of put a finer line on it, this is Doug, everything that we have done to date, we are funding with our existing capital capacity in addition to all of the developments that are currently underway and are very comfortable with our overall leverage, our use of capital in terms of where the dollars are going and how those dollars are coming in to the extent that we need additional capital to fund that. I mean everything that we've announced to date has been funded. Caitlin Burrows : Okay. And then maybe just on the development pipeline, you guys went through a lot of the leasing that was done in the quarter. But it didn't look like the development pipeline, in particular, recognize that active leasing. So just wondering if you could go through the activity that you're seeing for those projects and expectations going forward? Douglas Linde : Sure. So the only holes in our development pipeline to date are the Brooklyn Navy Yard, which is no longer part of development, which I described. And then our Reston Gateway project, which is -- and I'll let Jake and Pete Otteni, who are our regional team from Washington, D.C., talk about the leasing efforts there and sort of where we are. Jake Stroman : Sure. This is Jake Stroman in the D.C. region. So on the Reston Next project, we have about 150,000 square feet left to lease in the 1.1 million square foot building. We've actually had some great activity, lots of broker tours that have come through that building. We have -- we're trading proposals with a full floor tenant right now. And we're also going to engage a factory program on an additional 30,000 square feet, so -- which has been very successful in the Reston market to date. So really good activity, hoping to convert a few of those opportunities to leases here soon. Michael LaBelle : And then, Caitlin, on the stuff in Boston, I thought I'd describe that. So at 880 Winter Street, which is part of our [indiscernible] pipeline now, as I said, we have a 16,000 square foot letter of intent already signed and we have 180,000 square feet of active proposals, some of which are actionable right now, and we're just arguing about economics. And then we actually are -- we are in discussions with some tenant at 180 CityPoint. These are not discussions that have gotten to the point where we have a letter of intent that we've said is close to being executable. That building also is later. So the sequencing is 880 is delivered and ready for people to be working in it in August of 2022. And then about a year later, 180 CityPoint is available. And that's why I said, if you think about that, we also have these 2 new buildings that we've acquired at -- on Second Avenue with a lease expiration in the fourth quarter of 2022 to right in the sweet spot of where all this activity is. I think -- if you listen to the market commentary on demand for life science, particularly in the greater Boston market, there's way more demand than there are existing opportunity to lease space. Lots of people are talking about building this supply. Most of that supply are larger projects that won't be completed until 2024 to 2026. So the sweet spot of the market, from our perspective over the next couple of years, has a significant amount of demand and very little competitive supply. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Dilts with UBS. Brent Dilts : Great. On Page 16 of the supplement, where you break out second-generation leasing info, it's pretty clear, the retail portfolio in New York still is a bit of a challenge. But I think in your prepared remarks, you referred to some current negotiations in that portfolio. So could you just talk about your outlook for a recovery there? Douglas Linde : Yes. So I want to be very clear. So the reason that the numbers are as poor as they are in the retail portfolio in New York is because we took some space back or we re-leased some space on an as-is basis in 2019, okay, not in 2020, at the General Motors Building on Avenue. And the rents were dramatically lower than what the in-place rents were. That's the reason for the change, and that's effectively what happened. So we are now leasing vacant space, and the vacant space is obviously all going to be incremental. The rents are market rents. They're depending -- upon where the spaces are, they're commensurate with what you would hear from a retail team. I don't want to negotiate rents on this call. But the spaces that we're negotiating, a fitness center in the basement of an office building or a high-quality restaurant in Times Square are very, very different because of the nature of the spaces and the marketplaces. But it's -- we are acting at the market. Brent Dilts : Okay. Great. And then you have a decent amount of retail up for renewal in Boston in 3Q. Any color on how negotiations are for that space? Or if you've got plans to redevelop, et cetera? Douglas Linde : So our biggest hole in Boston is at Lord & Taylor. And we have lots of active dialogue going on, on that space, which we haven't seen revenue on for over a year, I think, almost 16 months, which we now have back. The expiration that you're pointing to in Boston is actually not an expiration. It's a lease that is in litigation with the other anchor. They are now paying on a contractual basis. And I don't expect that, that lease will be terminated in the third quarter. Whether we are able to work something out with them on a long-term basis, unclear, but they're not going anywhere in the short term. Owen Thomas : Basically, how we handled some of those leases where we had a retail tenant that defaulted, we terminated the leases. And then we -- in our rollout, we assume that it expires in the next quarter because they're sitting in it. And most of these tenants, we only have a couple left, but they're paying rent. And it's just a matter of time before we're able to kind of negotiate what the new deal will be. So the expirations in the third quarter in Boston are those situations. So as Doug described, we don't expect them to create vacancy. Brent Dilts : Okay. And then just one last quick one on Seattle. I know you've already talked about it a decent amount. But do you have a target for where you want to get that market to as a percent of the portfolio over time? Owen Thomas : Yes. So we -- I'll address that. Look, we set strategy top down. We like our gateway footprint, we think Seattle should be part of it. But the answer to your question is driven more by bottom-up opportunities. So we clearly want to be in Seattle. We're being aggressive there. We want it to grow. But it will be dependent on the volume and the timing of the attractive investments that we see. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Sorry, just to clarify on that retail lease at GM Building you mentioned, the 33,000 square foot excluded. Can you just remind us what that was and what drove that negative -- the big negative markdown? Douglas Linde : There was a space at General Motors that had a big negative markdown. And then there was also a space at 601 Lexington Avenue. So -- and I'm not going to tell you what the rents are. Like I said, I'm not going to negotiate rents for tenants on the phone. Vikram Malhotra : So just -- so those spaces were re-leased, and that's what drove the markdown? Douglas Linde : Yes. And one of them was -- and just as an FYI, I mean, this is technical. One of them was actually paying 0 because they had defaulted on their re-lease. But we are using their what-was-contractual rent to define what the change in mark-to-market is, even though they hadn't paid rent in 6 months prior to the date that they terminated. Vikram Malhotra : Okay. That's helpful. just given the talk we've had so far on employees wanting flexibility, employers maybe wanting slightly different things, I'm wondering if you can touch on 2 things. One, just sort of what you're seeing at your co-working platform and where you expect that to trend maybe in terms of just offerings in additional buildings? And then second, just on lease terms itself, are you seeing any variations in discussions on lease length or flexible options for termination or expansion, that would be helpful. Douglas Linde : Sure. So let me just define what our platform is. So we have in Boston FLEX by BXP in 3 CBD office buildings and then 1 suburban asset. And the character of the leasing there has actually been that it's picked up significantly over the past quarter. We've done, I'd say, 6 or 7 deals, which have leased all of the space at our suburban location and the vast majority of our space at the Prudential Center location. And we're in activity at The Hub on Causeway. And the nature of all those tenants are companies that don't know what their long-term growth is. They don't -- didn't have office space prior to the pandemic. They want to get back quickly, and they just need space because they want their people together. And they're saying, we want to -- we're going to take this for 6 to 9 months, and then we're going to figure out how much we need. And then we'll decide if we want to do additional flex space with you or we want a long-term commitment. And again, our spaces are generally 4,000 to 6,000 square feet max, and we have a few that are a little bit smaller. But it's -- that's the character of the spaces. Owen Thomas : And I think, Vikram, we don't have plans right now to grow that business. I mean that could change over time depending on the economic performance, but we don't have -- we're not planning to expand it at this time. Vikram Malhotra : Okay. Great. And then just -- sorry, just to clarify the lease -- the kind of the lease terms overall. Are you -- you're not seeing any change in sort of the components, whether it's term or just -- of out options or expansion options or anything like that? Douglas Linde : In the perfect world, the tenant would like to have an ability to get out of their lease whenever they can. We obviously -- we don't provide that kind of flexibility. As I think Owen said in his remarks, our average leases that were signed this quarter were 7.5 years. Typically, we've been telling people that we have an average lease length of 8 years. So it's de minimisly less. But again, the leases that are in active negotiation right now are all on average 10 years or more, all the activity that I described, including the life science stuff. And I would tell you that tenants would like -- as I said, would like to have more ability to be flexible in their space and buy their way out of leases. And occasionally, we are giving some of that flexibility after longer periods of time. You sign a 10-year lease, and you can terminate after the seventh year or something like that. But there really hasn't been any shift in the profile of the amount of time that the companies that are looking at our kind of spaces are expecting. And all of our build-to-suit stuff is still 10, 15 or 20 years. Vikram Malhotra : Okay. Great. And then sorry, just last one. I know the -- you've talked obviously a lot about Seattle, and it makes sense strategically. Just thinking about other markets, one of your West Coast peers expanded into Austin recently. And I guess you can never say never. But if we look at the next sort of 2 to 3 years, is it a possibility that you look at any of the kind of key Sunbelt markets as more tech tenants expand there? Owen Thomas : Look, we believe in our gateway strategy. We think Seattle was the logical expansion to -- as a gateway market. And there's plenty to do in the 6 markets we're in now. Vikram, you and others are focused on Seattle. I could argue we actually went into 3 new markets this quarter. One was the Park Avenue South, below -- Midtown South market. That's a new submarket for Boston Properties. The New York market is 3x the size plus of Seattle. It's got -- it's multiple cities in and of itself. We just went to a new one. And then our D.C. team went into the Montgomery County life science market, which we hadn't been in before, that's managed out of the D.C. region. So I think those 2 deals are evidence of all the robust opportunities we have to expand our footprint in our existing \"region.\" Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Ismail with Green Street. Daniel Ismail : Great. Maybe going back to the development pipeline. Doug, I believe you discussed the speculative restart of Platform 16. Are there any similar discussions across the non-life science pipeline such as 3 Hudson or anything else? Douglas Linde : I would say the only other project that is in our land portfolio this time that we're looking is the blocky residential development in Reston Next. I think that could be a start. You can see later this year, early next year. Owen Thomas : And then to your question specifically, we're going to need a really large tenant commitment to start 3 Hudson Boulevard or to start 343 Madison Avenue, which, by the way, won't even be in a position to start for a couple of years or any of the other land holdings that we have in our more urban locations. Daniel Ismail : Got it. And then you discussed throughout the call today about the quality of your portfolio and the outperformance that it's generating. And I'm curious, within the leasing activity this quarter or in the pipeline, are you seeing any tenants trading up from Class B space to Class A? Douglas Linde : I would say that we're not seeing people trading up from true Class B space because true Class B space is significantly less expensive than Class A, but we are getting tenants who are in what I would refer to as A minus minus buildings that are looking at our assets. In other words, modern inventory of office space that has really not been either amenitized as not -- where the landlords don't even understand what it means to create great place and great space, where they haven't made the changes to the infrastructure of the buildings, but where the building is well located. And so those tenants are there because of that and they're sort of saying, \"Wait a minute. Given everything that's gone on and the importance as Owen described of having great places for their employees to want to come back to and the health security issues that we've talked about ad nauseam for the last couple of quarters and how we're dealing with those things, there's just -- there's a flight to those kinds of environment that I believe is occurring.\" And so to answer one of the questions that was asked previously, I do believe that there will be buildings that were built, call it, in the modern era, so in the '70s, '80s, '90s, 2000s, that have not been well maintained or well thought of with landlords who really aren't thinking about the long-term viability of their buildings. They be left behind in our core cities as people move to better buildings and better -- with better landlords and better activities for their customers. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to the speakers for any closing remarks. Owen Thomas : Okay. Thank you, operator. We don't have any more formal remarks. And I just want to thank everybody on the call for their time and their interest in BXP. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's Boston Properties conference call. Thank you again for attending, and have a good day.",

During the Q&A portion of our call, Ray Ritchie, Senior Executive Vice President, and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks. Owen Thomas : Thank you, Laura, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will cover the economic recovery that's underway in the US, BXP's momentum in terms of financial results and leasing, private equity capital market conditions for office real estate and BXP's capital allocation activities and growth potential. The US economy continues to exhibit strong growth as we emerge from the COVID pandemic. US GDP grew 6.7% in the second quarter but is expected to slow in the third quarter due to the surge in infections caused by the Delta variant. However, daily COVID infection levels have dropped over 50% from highs in September, which bodes well for strong economic growth in future quarters. The relatively low unemployment rate at 4.8% is being driven by both new job creation, which recently has been tepid and workers withdrawing from the workforce. There are over 10 million job openings across the US and virtually every employer, including BXP, is experiencing a highly competitive labor market. Annual inflation remains high at [5.4%] in September, driven largely by energy prices, which are up 25% versus one year ago. Supply chain challenges are a primary topic this earnings season for many companies, and Doug will cover BXP's experiences in his remarks. Lastly, the 10-year US treasury rate has increased approximately 40 basis points to 1.6% since our last earnings call. Given the prospect of further interest rate increases, we've been very active refinancing our corporate and specific asset level debt. Interest rates remain extremely low relative to office cap rates and the yields we are achieving on our developments, creating the potential for lower cap rates and higher value creation in the quarters ahead. BXP's financial results for the third quarter continue to reflect the impact of this recovery and an increasingly favorable economic environment. Our FFO per share this quarter was $0.03 above market consensus and $0.04 above the midpoint of our guidance, which Mike will detail shortly. We completed over 1.4 million square feet of leasing, significantly more than double the volume achieved in the first quarter, well above the leasing achieved in the second quarter and just under our long term third quarter average. Our clients continue to make even longer term commitments as the leases signed in the third quarter had a weighted average term of 9.3 years versus 7.5 years in the second quarter. Year-to-date, we have completed 3.3 million square feet of leasing with an average lease term of 8.3 years. This success can be attributed to not only our execution but also the enhanced velocity and economics achieved in the current marketplace for premium quality, well amenitized assets, which are the hallmark of BXP's strategy and portfolio. In addition to our leasing activity, which included 524,000 square foot long term renewal with Wellington at Atlantic Wharf, Google purchased 1.3 million square foot building in New York for its use. In the Silicon Valley alone, Apple completed 720,000 square foot new requirement. Facebook is looking for 700,000 additional square feet. And ByteDance is searching for approximately 250,000 to 300,000 square feet. In the Seattle region, Facebook is pursuing 0.5 million square foot requirement in South Lake Union and Amazon has executed on enormous growth in Bellevue. I could go on. These examples support our repeatedly stated position that tenants are committed to the office as their location of choice to collaborate, innovate and train, all critical for their long term success. Measurable census in our portfolio also continues to improve. Our leading region is New York City, which hit 52% occupied last week. Our lagging region is San Francisco, which is increasing but currently at 18% and the remaining regions are in between. From watching on television, stadiums packed with unmasked people to trying to park at busy shopping centers to experiencing difficulties in making restaurant reservations in our core markets, it appears to us people are undoubtedly more comfortable with in-person activities. Liquidity fueled strong business performance and a tight labor market are clearly factoring into remote work decisions by businesses. However, as time progresses and the shortcomings of remote work become more apparent, we increasingly hear concerns from business leaders about the decaying cultures of their companies, inadequate training and difficulties in onboarding new professionals, as well as the potential for deterioration in innovation and competitiveness. We believe it's only a matter of time before employers more strongly encourage their teams to return to in-person work. Record levels of commercial real estate sold in the third quarter and private capital market activity for office assets is also recovering rapidly. $26 billion of significant office assets were sold in the third quarter, up 38% from last quarter and up 165% from the third quarter a year ago. Cap rates are arguably declining for assets with limited lease rollover in anything life science related given low interest rates, and activity is increasing for assets facing near term lease expirations. Of note this past quarter in all of our markets, One Canal Park an [empty] 112,000 square foot office building in Cambridge sold to a REIT for $131 million or $11.70 a square foot. As mentioned, Google exercised its option to purchase St. John's terminal in New York City, which is 1.3 million square foot office building that fully occupies and the price was $2.1 billion or $1,620 a foot. Coleman Highline, which is a 660,000 square foot office complex under construction in North San Jose and fully leased to Verizon sold for $775 million, which is $1,180 a square foot and a 4.2% initial cap rate to a non-US buyer. 153 Townsend St., which is 179,000 square foot office building in San Francisco sold for $231 million or $1,290 a square foot to a local operator and fund manager. This asset is fully leased to a single user, which has put the entire building on the sublease market. West 8 is a a 540,000 square foot office building in the Denny Triangle Seattle, sold for $490 million or $910 a square foot to REIT. The building is fully leased but faces significant rollover through 2023. 49% interest in 655 New York Avenue in Washington, D.C. sold for a gross price of $805 million or $1,060 a square foot and a 4.7% cap rate. The building comprises over 760,000 square feet, is 93% leased and sold to a non-US investor with a domestic adviser. And lastly, The Post, which is 100,000 square foot fully leased office building in Beverly Hills, sold for $153 million, which is $1,530 a square foot and 4.8% initial cap rate to a domestic fund manager. Now moving to BXP's capital market activity. We closed on the acquisition of Safeco Plaza and entered the Seattle market. BXP will own a one third interest in the asset along with two partners in our strategic capital program. We also closed the Shady Grove Biotech Campus acquisition and entered the Montgomery County, Maryland life science market. We're also on track to close the 360 Park Avenue South acquisition with Strategic Capital Program Partners on December 1st, thereby entering the Midtown South market in New York City. I described the economics for all these acquisitions last quarter. Regarding dispositions, we completed the sale of our Spring Street Office Park in Lexington Mass this week, bringing our share of gross sale proceeds from dispositions year-to-date to $225 million. We're also marketing for sale two additional buildings, which, if completed, are projected to yield approximately $200 million in gross proceeds. On development activities, this quarter, we delivered 0.5 million square feet of Verizon and other tenant space at 100 Causeway and 285,000 square feet of Fannie Mae space at Reston Next. In the aggregate, we have 4.3 million square feet of development [Technical Difficulty] underway that is 72% pre-leased. These future deliveries plus the stabilization of recently delivered projects are projected to add approximately $190 million to our NOI and 3.8% to our annual NOI over growth the next few years. So in summary, we had another active and successful quarter with strong leasing and financial results and entered several new geographic markets. We believe BXP is about to experience a strong growth ramp, which we project to be approximately 13% in FFO per share in 2022, driven by improving economic conditions and leasing activity, recovery of variable revenue streams, delivery of a well leased development pipeline, completion of four new acquisitions, a strong balance sheet combined with capital allocated from large scale private equity partners to pursue additional new investment opportunities as the pandemic recedes, a rapidly expanding life science portfolio in the nation's hottest life science markets and low interest rates and decreasing capital costs. Finally, I'd like to welcome Hillary Span, who is joining this call this morning to BXP's executive team. Hillary joined BXP right after Labor Day and will become our regional head in New York when John Powers retires in January. Let me turn our remarks over to Doug. Doug Linde : Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. I'm going to begin my remarks this morning with a few comments on the supply chain and its impact on our capital expenditures, both for new construction and our existing assets. So the impacts of the supply chain are both in time and money. Schedule is one of the criteria we use when we bid our jobs. And to date, we've been able to award bids while maintaining the schedules necessary to get our tenants in their spaces as required. The supply chain challenges have made the process much harder but we are still able to deliver the current development pipeline on time and within budget. And as you all know, we have contingencies that are in our budget and at some point, we are using those contingencies. However, in the near term, as we look at new jobs, there are fewer material choices and we are working closely with our consultants and our contractors to make sure that they are not specifying critical path items that could impact schedules. Our construction teams are working a lot harder at figuring out exactly how the key and the parts are put together. We are intentionally minimizing oversee items and we're releasing our material packages as early as possible. Trucking issues are real and at times, we are being forced to air freight as well as stockpile materials offsite, hence the use of some of our contingencies. There's no single answer to how much more is it going to cost. But when we're budgeting jobs that will start eight to 12 months from now, we're using 5% to 6% escalation in our total construction costs. We are in the process of rebidding our Platform 16 base building project, which was previously budgeted in late 2019 with an eye towards our 2022 restart. And we will have real time perspective in mid-November. But as of today, we just don't know what that's going to be. Supply shortages are also impacting our operating budgets. Energy is a material input into our operating expenses. While our largest utility cost is electricity, we are mostly hedged for 2022 and we have been successfully increasing our procurement from green power. We are still exposed to the marginal cost of electrical generation in the Boston region where we expect double-digit increases from last year. Cost for security, cleaning and engineering labor continues to increase due to labor shortages across all those trades. However, our lease contracts take two forms. We have net leases under which 100% of the operating expense and real estate taxes are paid by the tenant and we have gross leases with a base year that is set upon the lease commencement with increases in expenses over that base year added to the rental obligation of the tenant. In other words, our exposure is on our vacant space and for new or renewal leases where we are setting a base. This is a pretty small percentage of the total so it really doesn't have a material impact on our actual operating results as we look at 2022. As you saw in our supplemental, our second-generation leasing statistics were weak this quarter, and they need some finer explanation. I wish we could put all this into our press release but we simply can't. The universe of square footage that is encompassed in the statistics is about 500,000 square feet and it includes 105,000 square feet of short-term transactions 18 to 24 months that we signed in the heart of the pandemic with tenants that were not in a position to make a long term commitment, but they were prepared to extend for a negotiated discounted as-is deal. One of those tenants has since agreed to lease space for 13 years, where the interim rent was $60 a square foot and they'll be paying $103 a square foot, and this is in a New York asset. If you eliminate that 105,000 square feet, the statistics that we would have shown you changed dramatically, going from down 14% to effectively flat. You should also note that our transaction costs were also significantly below our run rate since there were no TIs involved in any of these short term deals. Our life science and office portfolio make up 91% of our revenues. As we look towards 2022, we currently have more than 800,000 square feet of signed leases that have not commenced. In 2022, lease expirations for the whole portfolio, not just our share, totaled about 2.9 million square feet and we already have renewal conversations underway on over 25% of that space. Historically, we have leased well over 1 million square feet a quarter each and every year. The question will be when those new expected leases will commence. Occupancy should slowly edge up in 2022. The changes in the quarter occupancy this quarter are due to the addition of the Shady Grove and Seattle acquisitions, not a degradation in our occupancy in our existing portfolio. Now let me give you a sense of what's going on in our portfolio today. New York is a good place to start. Tour activity, proposals and ultimately, leases continue to be very consistent with the commentary we've been providing during the last few quarters. The high end buildings are seeing good activity. Brokers that advise the small and midsized financial firms and professional services firms are very busy and their clients are taking action. Many of those users are incrementally increasing their space requirements as they continue to acquire people and AUM. Sublease space continues to gradually melt from the statistics. You may remember that we were asked about a 200,000 square foot sublet at 399 Park Avenue during various conference calls in 2020. That space has been taken off the market as the user reoccupies. Now there still is significant supply of direct and sublease space in New York City and our view is that net effective rents remain down 10% to 15% from pre-pandemic levels. During the quarter, we completed eight deals totaling 113,000 square feet in the CBD portfolio. Many of these spaces were vacant, but the two largest had a roll up of 8% in one case and a roll down of 4% in another. About 70,000 square feet of leases are in the category of leases that will not have revenue commencement until sometime in mid '22. Last week, we signed a lease at Dock 72 for 42,000 square feet. We don't anticipate this tenant completing their buildout until the latter half of '22. We have an additional 340,000 square feet of leases under negotiation in New York right now, including almost 200,000 square feet at Dock 72. We don't anticipate revenue commencement on [65%] of that space until 2023. One of the themes for next year is going to be a pickup in signed leases with contribution to occupancy or revenue flow-through occurring when tenants complete their installations in late '22 or '23, and we don't necessarily control those times. At Carnegie Center down in Princeton, we did eight leases for 38,000 square feet and have another 106,000 square feet in active lease documentation. One final note on New York before I turn to the other markets. Our culinary collective The Hugh has opened at our 53rd Street campus in 601 Lex. This is as good an example of place making as we can point to in our portfolio. As users who want to encourage their employees to come back to work this type of experience will dramatically enhance their physical space offering. It's why we do what we do. In Northern Virginia, our leasing team is seeing a consistent flow of inquiries, tours, lease proposals and ultimately, completed transactions. During the quarter, we completed seven leases totaling 70,000 square feet in Reston, and we're in lease negotiation on another seven deals totaling 125,000 square feet. The tech tenants that have identified the DC metro market as a fertile area for workforce expansion are continuing to grow and their growth is going to be in Northern Virginia. In addition, the contractors that service the defense and the homeland security are also expanding. There are significant vacancy in northern Virginia. But the urban market core in Reston is under 10% vacant, and it continues to dramatically outperform with starting rents in the high 40s to low 50s gross and with our Reston Next project opening up this week, the rents are starting to hit the low 60s. The Reston Next development is welcoming Fannie Mae into the building this month and we are actively marketing and leasing the remaining 160,000 square feet of available space. Our Reston Town Center retail place making is also very active. During the quarter, we completed a lease with a new theater operator for 50,000 square feet. Last week, we signed a 20,000 square foot lease with a local restaurant distillery and yesterday, a new 20,000 square foot fitness operator. We have three more restaurants totaling 22,000 square feet that are close to execution. This 115,000 square feet of leased retail is not expected to have any revenue contribution until 2023. In the District of Columbia, we continue to chip away at our current availability at Net Square 901 New York Avenue and Market Square North. We completed seven leases for 49,000 square feet during the third quarter and have signed another 32,000 square feet during October. Just as an aside, we completed a major repositioning of Next Square this year. And year-to-date, we've signed 162,000 square feet over eight transactions when we do our work our buildings lease. The urban downtown recovery in San Francisco continues to lag our other markets. Very few businesses have commenced their return to work, downtown streets remain quiet, much of the ground plane remains closed and the city has had a very restrictive mass mandate. As Owen pointed out, daily consensus continues to be significantly below all our other urban markets. There's been a reduction of sublease space in the market stemming from active lease commitments and reoccupancy plans, but overall availability continues to be elevated. This description while accurate overlooked important subtleties in the market. Pre-pandemic, there was very little available space in high-quality, multi-tenanted buildings, particularly those with views. Broadly speaking, those conditions still exist for that segment of the market. The bulk of the demand in the last 18 months has come from traditional financial asset management and professional services firms that have focused on the best space in the best buildings. This has resulted in very little change to leasing economics in the best buildings, particularly in spaces we've used. We've discussed this on recent calls and it continues today. This quarter, we've completed over 100,000 square feet of leases, including [four] full floor transactions in Embarcadero. The average starting rent was just over $100 a square foot on those full floor deals, a 21% increase over expiring rents. We are negotiating leases on another 106,000 square feet right now. And from what we've seen, these experiences are being repeated in a competitive set north of market. In contrast, sublet transactions are being closed at significant concessions to pre-pandemic economics, but with no capital. Life science activity at our Gateway development continues to be healthy. The BXP ARE joint venture has signed an LOI with a full building user for 751 Gateway, 230,000 square feet and we're actively responding to proposals for our anticipated redevelopment of 651 Gateway, about 300,000 square feet, which won't commence until the third quarter of next year. Further down the Peninsula and Mountain View, activity has picked up in the last 30 days. This quarter, we completed two full building deals totaling 58,000 square feet. We're seeing less information gathering exercises and a lot more active tours with RFPs and the need for immediate occupancy or early 2022 occupancy. There are, as Owen said, large tech requirements active in the Silicon Valley. For those of you who saw that the Tesla announcement that they're moving their headquarters to Texas, you may have missed that they leased 325,000 square feet in Palo Alto contemporaneously with that announcement. High quality new construction availability is very limited in the valley and we're actively considering when we should restart the construction of Platform 16 next to Diridon Station and the future of Google development in San Jose. Finally, let's touch on Boston. In the high end market in the Boston CBD, particularly in the Back Bay, there is currently limited availability, particularly with use space. Rents have remained at pre-pandemic levels and concessions are only marginally higher. As we move closer to 2023, there will be additional new construction supply entering the market in the CBD but not the Back Bay. As Owen mentioned, the big lease for the quarter was the early renewal with Wellington. They agreed to expand by 70,000 square feet at Atlantic Wharf, and we're going to terminate 156,000 square feet at 100 Federal Street in 2023. The space we're getting back is leased at a rate that's below market, so we're optimistic that we can create additional value through this re-let. We completed an additional 73,000 square feet of leases in our Back Bay portfolio, and we have about 50,000 square feet of leases under negotiation today in that same group of properties. The Boston retail portfolio is also very active. We have signed an LOI for the 118,000 square feet formerly occupied by Lord & Taylor, as well as 40,000 square feet of in-line space that's currently vacant or in default. This 158,000 square feet will likely commence paying rent in early '23. As we move to the suburbs, life science is dominating our activities. Last week, we signed our first lease at 880 Winter Street, our lab conversion that we started four months ago, 37,000 square foot deal, which will deliver in the middle of next year, and we are in the final stages of negotiation on another 128,000 square feet which will bring that 224,000 square foot building to 74% leased, and we have active dialog on the rest of the space. And during the quarter, we signed over 105,000 square feet of leases with life science tenant at 1,000 [winner], 1,100 [winner] and Reservoir Place for additional office buildings. As we move into '22, we're developing plans to convert additional available office space in Waltham into lab space. So to summarize, we've seen a recovery in employment, as Owen discussed. Employers are aggressively looking to hire, capital raising in the venture world is breaking through levels never seen and [IPO] takeouts are at a historically high levels. Conditions are right for recovery in office absorption. Employers are going to want to use their physical space to encourage their teams to be together. Our mantra has been to create great places and spaces to allow our customers to use space as a way to attract and retain their talent. If you believe that employees may be spending less time in their offices, it's even more important to have the right space in place when they're present. And I'll stop there and give it over to Mike. Mike LaBelle : Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. Before I jump into the details of our third quarter earnings as well as our 2021 and 2022 guidance, I want to touch on our recent financing activities. This quarter, we took advantage of the low interest rate environment and very attractive credit spreads to issue $850 million of 12 year unsecured green bonds when the underlying 10 year treasury rate was 1.3%. We achieved a coupon of 2.45%, the lowest in the company's history. We utilized the proceeds to redeem $1 billion of 3.85% unsecured notes on October 15th. Those notes were scheduled to expire in early 2023 and represented our largest debt maturity through 2025. The early prepayment will result in a redemption charge of $0.25 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021. We will benefit from the 140 basis point drop in the relative debt cost and we are thrilled to issue such attractive long-term financing. The only other significant debt maturity we have in the next 18 months is our $620 million mortgage on 601 Lexington Avenue in New York City that expires in April of next year. Similar to the bond we redeemed, this loan also carries an above-market interest rate of 4.75%. Given the increase in the cash flows from the building, owing partially to the redevelopment we completed earlier this year, we anticipate that we will be able to increase the size of the financing and reduce the interest rate substantially. We're working on this now, and our assumptions include closing before the end of 2021. The impact of these financing activities will be accretive to our 2022 earnings through a meaningful drop in our interest expense from 2021 that I will touch on in a minute. First, I'd like to describe our third quarter 2021 results. For the third quarter, we announced FFO of $1.73 per share, that's $0.04 per share higher than the midpoint of our guidance and $0.03 ahead of consensus estimates. Our outperformance came from better portfolio NOI with $0.02 of higher rental and parking revenue and approximately $0.02 of lower than projected operating expenses. Looking at our parking revenues, they started to accelerate sequentially as clients and visitors increased driving days into our properties. As Owen described, we're seeing building census grow and the results are evident in our parking. Our share of this quarter's parking revenue totaled $22 million. This compares to a comparable pre-COVID quarterly result from the third quarter 2019 of $28 million. At the bottom, in the second quarter of 2020, our share of parking revenue was $14 million, so we are over 50% of the way back. On an annualized basis using the third quarter run rate, we have about $25 million of revenue or $0.14 per share to recover before we are back to pre-COVID annual parking levels of $113 million. Our Kendall Square hotel was profitable for the first time in six quarters contributing about $1 million of positive NOI. Given the hotel's location in the heart of Cambridge and adjacent to MIT, we expect that it will ultimately restabilize at or above the $15 million annual NOI generated in 2019, though certainly not in 2022. The third leg of our ancillary income is our retail income. Other than in San Francisco, nearly all of our retailers have returned to paying previous contract rents. This quarter, our share of retail rental revenue was $43.6 million. On an annualized basis, this is $16 million less than our share of 2019 retail revenue, which totaled $190 million. And as Doug mentioned, we have some vacancy in our retail due to the pandemic but we're negotiating leases now on significant portions of that space. If you combine and annualize our third quarter hotel NOI and our share of parking and retail revenues, we have the opportunity to gain approximately $52 million or $0.30 per share to return to 2019 full year levels. We believe that all three of these income streams will fully recover and ultimately exceed prior peaks over time. Looking at the rest of this year, we released fourth quarter 2021 guidance of $1.50 to $1.52 per share and full year 2021 guidance of $6.50 to $6.52 per share. Our fourth quarter guidance includes the $0.25 share redemption charge related to our bond refinancing. Excluding the charge, our fourth quarter guidance would be sequentially higher than third quarter results by $0.03 per share at the midpoint. The improvement is primarily from Verizon taking occupancy of its 440,000 square foot lease at the Hub on Causeway office development this quarter and lower interest expense after our refinancing. And while we expect our same priority portfolio NOI will also grow sequentially, the growth is partially offset by the FFO dilution from the sale of our Spring Street office campus in suburban Boston that closed for $192 million this week. Turning to our assumptions for 2022. Last night, we released our 2022 FFO guidance. We have three major drivers that are all headed in the right direction that provide for very strong FFO growth of 13% at the midpoint over 2021. The drivers include delivering a significant volume of leased new developments and acquisitions, growth in our same property portfolio and our refinancing activities that lower our interest expense. The first growth driver is developments and acquisitions. We're delivering five of our development properties over the next four quarters, totaling $1.6 billion of investment. These projects totaled 3 million square feet of additions to our portfolio and are 92% leased, they include; the Hub on Causeway in Boston that is leased to Verizon; 325 Main Street in Cambridge that is leased to Google; the 200 West Street Life Science development in Waltham that is leased to Translate Bio; Marriott's new headquarters facility in Bethesda, Maryland; and Reston Next that is leased to Fannie Mae and Volkswagen in Reston. It is also possible that our Life Science conversion at 880 Winter Street in Waltham will begin to contribute in late 2022. In total, we expect our development deliveries to contribute an incremental $65 million to $70 million to our FFO in 2022. Additionally, we've layered in several acquisitions that we completed this year, most notably Safeco Plaza in Seattle and our Life Science project we acquired in Waltham. We expect these acquisitions will add $7 million to $10 million to our share of NOI next year. The second growth driver for 2022 is the projected growth in our same property portfolio NOI. Our guidance assumes that our share of same property NOI will grow between 2% and 3.5% next year. The growth is expected to come from higher parking revenues, improvement in occupancy and pricing in our residential portfolio, higher NOI from our hotel and increased occupancy in our office portfolio. Our leasing velocity has picked up in the last two quarters where we've leased 2.7 million square feet of signed leases. Given the length of the typical leasing cycle, many of these leases we've signed or are negotiating will take occupancy either in late '22 or '23. We expect the improvement in our headline office occupancy to be gradual. As Doug described, we have several larger leases in the works for vacant space where we anticipate occupancy will occur in 2023. On a cash basis, we expect our share of 2022 same property NOI growth to be much stronger at between 5.5% and 6.5% over 2021. This equates to between $90 million and $100 million of incremental cash NOI to 2022. Much of our cash NOI growth is coming from approximately $50 million of free rent that is burning off in contractual leases. Our third FFO growth driver is coming from lower interest expense. As I mentioned earlier, we will incur a debt redemption charge of $0.25 per share in the fourth quarter of '21. We do not expect that this will recur. Also, we are aggressively refinancing loans that were placed five to 10 years ago in a higher interest rate environment with low cost current market financing. Partially offsetting this, we do expect to see higher interest expense in our joint venture portfolio. This is because we will cease capitalization of interest on the Marriott and Hub on Causeway projects when they are delivered into service. In aggregate, we expect that 2022 interest expense will be $52 million to $60 million less than in 2021. That equates to $0.30 to $0.34 of incremental positive impact on our 2022 FFO. So to summarize, our guidance for 2022 FFO was $7.25 to $7.45 per share. The midpoint of our range is $7.35, which is 13% or $0.84 a share higher than the midpoint of our 2021 guidance. At the midpoint, the incremental growth is coming from $0.43 from development and acquisitions, $0.25 from our same property portfolio and $0.32 from lower interest expense. This will be offset by $0.06 of dilution from our 2021 disposition activity, $0.06 of lower termination income and $0.04 of higher G&A. The past 18 months have brought challenges and uncertainty to so many, including our team at BXP. These past few months, it's been heartening to see our cities reopen, our colleagues and our clients starting to return to their offices and office leasing volumes picking up. As I spelled out, we anticipate very strong FFO growth in 2022. And beyond 2022, we have more developments underway that will deliver additional FFO. Plus, we have the highest quality portfolio of office buildings that we believe will generate higher occupancy rates and earnings in the future. Operator, that completes our remarks. Can you please open the line up for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first response is from Steve Sakwa, Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Appreciate all the detail. I don't think I caught everything, but two quick questions. Mike, when you talked about retail and sort of what you were potentially recapturing, I just want to make sure for tenants that are currently in occupancy today but maybe aren't fully paying their stated rent, can you remind us what that dollar amount is just on a quarterly basis? Mike LaBelle : I don't think I have that number in front of me, Steve, but we've got $43.6 million that is our share currently. So we\u2019re missing about $16 million on an annual basis. So most of that, honestly, is coming from filling vacant space. I would say that there's very little remaining in the way of kind of deferrals and things like that for retail tenants right now. In San Francisco, which is the smallest retail portfolio we have because the tenants there just don't pay high rents, that's where the tenants haven't all returned to occupancy and the vast majority of them are not paying rent. So that's the place where those deferrals are. I mean I think that's probably $2 million a year, something like that, that's not the most significant piece. The big chunks are some of the stuff Doug talked about, where we're filling the Lord & Taylor space, that's a big 120,000 square feet. We've got a number of new retailers coming into the Pru where we had vacancy that was created by some bankruptcies there and then in Reston as well. So those are kind of the big ticket items where it's coming from. So I would say most of it is coming from filling vacant space, not from tenants that were deferring rents and are going to be paying contract going forward. Doug Linde : If you take the summation of all the spaces that I described where I sort of basically said we're not going to receiving rent until probably late '22 or early '23, I want to say it's somewhere north of 250,000 square feet and the average rent is probably $45 a square foot net. So we're talking about $11 million or $12 million of incremental revenue from that portfolio of available, that\u2019s currently either leased or LOI space that we will get leased in the next couple of months. Steve Sakwa : And then I just wanted to circle back on the average occupancy that you sort of outlined for '22, the 88% to 90%. Just to be clear, is that wide range really sort of, I guess, due to the uncertainty over when leases will start or is some of that uncertainty because leases actually need to get signed over the next, say, three to six months and then they need to commence? I'm just trying to figure out how much is a timing of when the revenue will start from a GAAP perspective versus how much actually needs to get leased? Mike LaBelle : So again, just going back to where I started from. So right now, we'll call it 88% plus leased, and we have 800,000 square feet of signed leases that haven't commenced yet. Most of that will commence in the latter parts of 2022. As I said, we're working on renewals on about 25% right now of our 2.9 million square feet of space, which is, call it, 700,000 square feet of space, plus or minus. And we've been doing over 1 million square feet a quarter of incremental leasing in the portfolio. So we don't have -- it's not a heavy lift for us to get the space leased. The challenge is we're not sure what the timing is going to be. We don't -- you know we're going to sign a lease for 195,000 square feet with another tenant at Dock 72 and unlikely they're going to be in, in '22, but they could be. But we're assuming or not, right? So that's the sort of the, I'd say, the art behind our range of occupancy. Operator : Our next response is from Emmanuel Court with Citi. Emmanuel Court : Doug, I think you mentioned the net effective levels in New York versus pre-COVID of about 10% to 15%, if I caught that correctly. Do you have similar metrics for the rest of your markets? Doug Linde : I would tell you that, I guess, I tried to imply this. Rents and concessions haven't changed in San francisco. They haven't changed in Boston. I mean, as we've talked about, they've actually gotten better in suburban Boston and in Cambridge because we've been doing more life science as opposed to office. So I'd say that they're up to flat. And then in Washington D.C., they're actually slightly down and rested because there's a slight amount of concession increase but rents are pretty consistent with where they were. And honestly, I don't think they've really changed in Washington D.C. because Washington D.C. market was very challenged pre-pandemic and those conditions just remain today. Emmanuel Court : And then if we look at your leasing pipeline, how much of your pipeline is new to market tenants versus moves or trade trade-ups maybe from other buildings in the market, if you could classify it that way? Doug Linde : I don't know how you define a new-to-market tenant, because there are very few companies that are now relocating to any of these places from others. So I'd say, in general, we're moving up our quality and/or we're expanding in the market relative to the amount of space we have, or we're consolidating into a better building from where we were before it. That's where the bulk of the demand is coming from other than obviously, life science. Those are new formations the companies are located here. But I mean, the least we're negotiating right now, for example, at 880 is a company that did their IPO. They're moving from 80,000 square feet or [60,000] square feet currently and they're adding another 120,000 square feet, that's sort of dramatic growth that's occurring. Emmanuel Court : I guess maybe to ask the question different way. If we look at the market vacancies, so if we listen to any of the broker calls or read any of the reports, when we look at the market vacancies. How much should we expect those market vacancies to change versus you sort of getting a bigger share of the pie and your occupancy can move up but market vacancies might be sticky at the levels they're at? Doug Linde : It's a hard question to answer. Part of it is going to have to do with how much of the sublet space gets absorbed. So as the sublet space gets absorbed that will improve the overall market statistic. So for example, if you look at Manhattan, I want to say there's probably been 4 million to 5 million square feet of space that's been taken off the sublet market over the last couple of quarters, that's improving the statistics but you're still talking about a very high level. I would say that we will outperform the market relative to where we are. I can't tell you whether our percentage change will be higher or lower than the market, because we just don't have enough clarity on how much of the sublet space, which is the bulk of where the existing availability came from in San Francisco and in New York City, which is obviously those are the two weakest markets from a statistical perspective, how much of that is going to melt. Operator : Your next response is from Nick Yulico with Scotia Bank. Nick Yulico : I was hoping to just get a feel for what the leasing spreads were on signed leases in the quarter? I know you quote those on commenced leases. Doug Linde : So I tried to give you that where I could. I mean I told you that, again, when we have vacant space that's been vacant for less than 12 -- more than 12 months, we don't quote what the spread is. But I said in San Francisco, the spread was about 20%. In New York City of the larger deals we did, I said some of it was up 8% and some of it was down 4%. So I guess what I was trying to convey was that it's sort of flattish in New York City right now with the portfolio of spaces that we did this quarter. In the greater Boston market virtually everything is up. And then again, if you look at our D.C. market, the deals that we're doing in Reston are modestly up or down on the rent level because of the question of how much growth there was in the rent over the last period of time that the existing tenant was in there. So if we had a deal that was done 10 years ago and we had 3% increases every year, there was probably a modest amount of negative rental rate growth. If the tenant was a shorter term deal, it's probably positive because there's been a pickup in terms of, I guess, the strength of the market over the last 12 to 18 months. Mike LaBelle : And Nick, these rents are all cash to cash. So GAAP to GAAP, It's much higher. Nick Yulico : Just second question is on San Francisco, and hear a little bit more about your thoughts about the potential for that city to recover. Obviously, it's much different dynamic. You talked about mass mandates, it's also a city that's kind of split between a financial district being more empty than the residential areas of the city. You have tech companies that aren't pushing employees back to work in the way that banks are in New York. So I guess just a thought on kind of how the recovery potential of that market, if there's also maybe a return of some larger potential tenants looking for space in that market? And then the second part is, your willingness to invest further in the city since there is talk about one of the larger development sites in the city potentially coming up as an opportunity? Owen Thomas : COVID has had the biggest impact on San Francisco of all the markets where we operate. And I think a lot of that has been the technology tenants in some ways, leading the way on work from home and second, the very restrictive COVID mandates that have been put in place. And the lifting of those mandates has lagged all of our other cities and that's undoubtedly had an impact on the census data that I mentioned earlier. That all being said, San Francisco remains arguably the technology capital of the world. It's got the largest cluster of computer science workers certainly in the United States. And we believe in the long term recovery of the San Francisco market, but I do think it will lag our other markets. We will continue to invest in the area. Doug talked about the potential for us to restart our Platform 16 development. We haven't made that decision yet but that's something that we'll be talking more about in future quarters. We also have a very attractive development site at 4th and Harrison that we will be looking at certainly in '22 and '23. And we are open for business and we'll consider other investments if they make sense for shareholders. Operator : Your next response is from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : The concerns with the supply chain, do you think this will delay or taper development projects, either for you or your competitors, just given market rents are not really moving up in lockstep with the additional cost? Doug Linde : So I guess what you're getting at is how is inflation going to impact the overall development model going forward. If there is significant inflation then the rents that are necessary to justify new construction, assuming interest rates are also going up are going to need to rise, and there's no question that speculative development will be more challenging. But there are still lots of customers in this country who want new construction and want the best and brightest of the way buildings are built, potentially being very green carbon neutral, net zero, whatever you want to describe it as, it's harder to do that with an older building. And so I think the question will be, what will the character of the leasing be and where will it occur. But I don't think it's going to necessarily stop new construction. I do think that speculative office development is a very, I'd say, challenging proposition today in most markets because of the amount of supply that exists. But remember that when you're starting a new building, you're talking about delivering somewhere between 36 and 48 months later if it's a high rise. And then even if it's a low rise building, it's a minimum of 24 months. So people's views on what the world will look like when we get to those periods of time, will it be influential. And I mean, as Owen just suggested, we're looking at the Silicon Valley and we're looking at Platform 16, and we're saying to ourselves that's a really interesting market relative to the amount of demand that currently exists today. The lack of high quality first class Class A office product, the potential location of the building that we would be building relative to transportation. And so we're pretty optimistic in certain instances but clearly, it's not what it would have been three years ago. John Kim : And Doug, you mentioned the impact that the short term leases had on your leasing spreads this quarter. How much of a drag will that be in future quarters? Doug Linde : I think there's very little remaining. I mean, it was kind of a tsunami of these deals, all starting in this quarter of 2021. I mean just to sort of give you a little bit of the sausage making. We're sitting out in late 2020 and we have leases expiring in '21 and the tenants aren't using their spaces. And they're coming to us and saying, well, we're not sure what we're going to do. We might just give the space back. But if you cut us a deal in a short term, we'll hold the space and we'll continue to look at it and we'll think about what we're going to do in the future, it's a negotiation. And our view was very sort of selfishly rather have half a dollar than a whole dollar versus no dollar. And again, we're starting to see the success of that strategy, which is the tenants that did those short term commitments are going to likely be renewing on a long-term basis, and we'll get a dramatic uptick. And I guess, when you see in New York City in a couple of quarters, big increases because we went from $60 net gross number to $100 gross number, it's not because the market has gotten better it's because we're moving away from what we did in the last couple of quarters. Operator : Your next response is from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Alexander Goldfarb : So two questions. First, OT, as you talk -- or Doug, as you guys talk to different CEOs and office managers, what are they telling you as far as the decision of some, not all, but to keep punting on the return to office? I mean, in fact, we even heard of one company that suspended indefinitely return to office. Is it a fear that these companies have that their employees will just go elsewhere because it's such a tight labor market? Is it that commutes are still really bad and people just don't feel like schlep in, whether it's New York or San Francisco where I know you guys are in Chicago, but Chicago is another sort of hard hit CBD. What is the reason that you're hearing that these companies keep delaying? Because obviously, as you point out, restaurants are full, planes are full, leisure hotels are full. So it's clearly not a fear of COVID that's keeping people at home. Owen Thomas : I think pretty much universally, the CEOs and business leaders we talk to, if they're not back in the office, they want to figure out a way to get back in the office for all the reasons I articulated in my opening remarks. So we think that's going on. The delay that we experienced this fall, I do think was driven by health security. The infection levels from the delta variant elevated, cities put on mask mandates and things, it's not pleasant to be in an office building wearing a mask. So that's a very real thing even if you're not concerned about COVID. But that being said, as I mentioned, the infection levels are down. And I do think the tight labor market is factoring into CEO's decisions and the desire by some, certainly not all, employees to continue to work remotely that has caused some delays. But as I articulated, I think over time, I can't predict what the virus is going to do. But I do think over time, you're going to see more and more companies bringing their employees back to the office because those leaders are concerned about the future competitiveness and cohesion of their companies. Doug Linde : I would also say, Alex, that there's something else going on, which is you get a lot of public positive reaction when you say, hey, we're thinking of remaining hybrid or we're thinking of delaying our return. You don't get that same hurrah when you say everyone must be back by January 3rd. And what we're seeing, I mean, we had two conversations yesterday, one with a tech company, one with a professional services company, and they both told us they've already sent out announcements to their folks that, hey, in one case, they want everybody to start coming back to the office on a hybrid model in November. And the other one is, hey, you better be near your office because we expect it to be back in January. Those companies are companies that have also, we know publicly have said, we're not sure when we're coming back and we've delayed things, and they're not publicly stating what I just described. So I think there's more going on right now relative to companies starting to put pressure on their existing employee base that it's time to start to think real hard about moving yourself into the right location so that you can be in the office on a much more consistent basis going forward. Alexander Goldfarb : I just thought, I mean if you have companies paying people, the one paying gets to drive the bus. So it's funny that right now, it's like the passengers driving instead of the bus driver, but\u2026 Owen Thomas : I think the other demonstration of proof of concept is look at all the leasing that's going on in our own company and in the market. If companies weren't committed to the office, why would they be leasing all the space? Alexander Goldfarb : The next question is, as far as life science goes, you entered D.C. -- I mean, you entered Maryland. On life science, you hadn't been there before. I was just reading an article this week or last week that people are contemplating in the Navy Yards trying to do life science. As you guys look around your portfolio, whether it's now like south Lake Union in Seattle, maybe the Navy Yards in Brooklyn is a spot, maybe, maybe not, or maybe San Diego would be a good life science market to enter. How many areas do you see the potential to expand your life science development program to? And do you think it would lead you to new markets driven by life science or most of the life science development that you're looking at is really in your existing markets plus Seattle? Owen Thomas : First thing I would say is almost half of the lab space in the country is in Boston and in the San Francisco area where we're already very active. And if you look at the best opportunity we have as a company is to build what we have. I mean we have 5 million square feet, plus or minus, of land for development and multiple millions of square feet of redevelopments. And we control all that real estate at pre-COVID, pre-life science pricing. So I think that's our best opportunity. But that being said, just as we did in Montgomery County, we're open for business for making new acquisitions and we're certainly going to focus in the markets where we're active first. Operator : Your next response is from Ronald Camden with Morgan Stanley. Ronald Camden : A couple of quick ones for me. Just first is just a lot of transparency sort of the 2022 outlook and the same store cash NOI guidance. I was just wondering, I think you touched on some of the drivers for same store cash NOI. But is there a way to quantify sort of the contribution from whether it's retail or for the hotel versus sort of the core office, that would be helpful. Mike LaBelle : So look, I think we're going to get some nice benefit from parking coming back. If you look at quarter-over-quarter over quarter, it's continuing to improve. So I think that's a big one. I also think we're going to get some nice benefit from some of the residential properties that we have, where pricing is improving and we've got some lease-up opportunity there. The hotel is a little bit harder to gauge, honestly, because it's just tougher to project. So I would say we're not necessarily expecting -- I think it will improve but we're not expecting a huge impact there. And then the portfolio is the rest and it's going to be a little bit more moderate. And again, I think it's related to what we see as kind of a gradual improvement in our occupancy with the hotel, which we think is going to accelerate into 2023 as some of these leases that we're talking about are going into occupancy and actually generating revenue. Ronald Camden : And then sort of the second question was just maybe asking a compare contrast between New York and San Francisco a different way. Certainly heard that clearly, San Francisco is behind New York. But is the expectation still that at some point they're going to be on the same recovery trajectory, or is there anything that you're hearing or seeing that\u2019s may be different between those markets that that could solve that? So when you think about Europe versus San Francisco, are there any sort of unique factors in San Francisco for the lag basically? Mike LaBelle : You're asking honestly, a social question more than an office question in my opinion, because the reason that San Francisco and quite frankly, the State of California is behind is because of the decisions that have been made by the health departments and the political leadership. And we unfortunately don't control those decisions. When San Francisco starts to have a significant return to the office wave, I think it will pick up rapidly and that we will start to see a significant recovery. Remember that pre-pandemic, Manhattan and New York had a supply problem and San Francisco did not have a supply problem. So the opportunity from for San Francisco is how much of that labor will want to come back and how quickly will those companies that have grown dramatically in terms of their own headcounts during the pandemic want to bring those people into close proximity with each other on a day-to-day basis. And there's an opportunity for San Francisco to accelerate and to quickly return, it's got a challenge from a political perspective right now and it's got a challenge from a statistical perspective because there's a lot more available space on a percentage basis than there was and has ever been from a sublet perspective. Manhattan is still way below where it once was, call it, 2002, 2003 from a sublet as a percentage of the market. San Francisco is way above where it's been historically. And again, a lot of that space could be reoccupied by the companies that chose to kind of cope up on the sublet market. And so I think that's what ultimately is going to be the thing that changes the trajectory of San Francisco in terms of its rate of recovery pace. Bryan Koop : Doug, as evidence of what you mentioned on social, for Boston -- this is Bryan Koop. Pre-Labor Day, we were ticking up every week in terms of occupancy. And then the City of Boston that the state came out with a stricter mandate on masking, et cetera, and that changed the return for like five to six of our major firms, and it ticked back down. We're starting to see that come back up again. And in fact, one of our buildings, 888 hit, I believe, close to 70% occupancy last week. So it's evidence of the social part in the city saying what's going on for that particular market. Operator : Your next response is from Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Blaine Heck : Owen or Doug, as I think you guys mentioned a few times in your remarks, it seems like we're still seeing the majority of leasing activity, and even investment sales activity is concentrated in high quality assets that are either recently developed or have recently undergone major renovations. So I guess to take the opposite side of an earlier question, do you think there's a risk in any of your specific markets that these trends spur additional new development as office landlords kind of position themselves to benefit from the flight to quality that we're seeing but ultimately, maybe they end up hurting the market as a whole by adding new space? Owen Thomas : I'm not sure that's a risk we're concerned about at this time. I mean the -- I agree with what you said about the interest by both investors. I would say, by the way, the interest by investors is in assets that are of high quality or have the potential to be high quality, and on the interest by tenants in higher quality buildings. But the markets, even though they're recovering the level of availability, including sublease space is quite high and that will be a headwind. And as Doug described, construction costs are going up because of supply chain issues, which makes development more difficult. So it's an interesting question but I'm not sure that's a major risk that faces us at this time. Blaine Heck : And then maybe one for Mike. You guys have been running at high operating margins relative to prepandemic levels. So I wanted to get your sense for how sustainable those margins are going forward and how sticky any of the expense savings that you guys achieved during the pandemic might be as utilization and physical occupancy increases within your portfolio? Mike LaBelle : I mean, I think our margins should be continuing to run between 63.5% and 64.5%. As Doug described, the increases that we may see in some of our operating expenses, the vast majority of that stuff gets passed through to our tenants. So we don't expect to see an impact, significant impact from those items. And if you look over time, we've gone through inflationary and deflationary times over long periods of time and our operating margins have been within a band. So I would not expect that we would suddenly have a 200 basis point change or something like that in those margins, that's just not what we see happening. Operator : Your next response is from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Unidentified Analyst : This is Julien on for Caitlin. There's been a lot of talk, obviously, and this is following up on some of the questions about shifting to tenant demand towards newer high quality well amenitized product. And obviously, that shift will benefit some of your assets, both your recent builds and redeveloped assets. But is the elevated vacancy at the tail end of your portfolio, call it that older vintage, non-lease certified office product making you reconsider the strategic fit of some of these assets? I'm thinking of vacancies at Carnegie Center, Gateway Commons, Bay Colony Corporate Center, Colorado Center, et cetera. And then second part of that question would be, does it make economic sense to make capital intensive redevelopments in some cases? Sounds like you have plans at Gateway, not sure if Bay Colony would be eligible for conversion to lab space. But more broadly, maybe to try to elevate some of these assets to lead gold platinum certifications? Doug Linde : So I'm not trying to be cheeky here, but you and Caitlin should spend some time actually coming out and seeing our portfolio, because I think a lot of these questions would be answered. We've been talking about all of the renovations that we've been doing up at Bay Colony as an example. And I mentioned a few minutes ago that we've done 100,000 square feet of new leases with life science companies, and we're actively looking at converting some of those buildings to full life science buildings. Carnegie Center is probably the most amenitized project in Central New Jersey and we have a tremendous amount of investment that's been made and it's been very receptive. So I think that the -- and by the way, we are probably at the forefront of lead, not just silver but platinum, new lead standards, energy efficiency, indoor air quality. I mean we are doing those things as a road task today everywhere in our portfolio. So I would tell you that the portfolio doesn't have any of those issues that you might describe as challenges. And honestly, we have as much vacancy in a Class A office building today as we've had in other challenging time periods. And again, we are committed to picking up our occupancy rate and we are doing that as I described in my comments relative to the amount of leasing that we're doing today. So we feel really good about the whole portfolio. Now there are some markets that are less hearty as than others relative to the amount of leasing demand and San Francisco is obviously one of them. But as an example, you mentioned Gateway. We're taking 651 Gateway out of service to convert it to life science. It's why it's got a 90, square foot lease and 300,000 square foot building. We're trying to clear it out. So we are actively doing those things. But I would really encourage you guys to actually spend some time with our teams and get a feel for the portfolio. Owen Thomas : And the only thing I would add to what Doug said is, we have 53 million plus or minus square foot portfolio. We sell to the $500 million of assets per year. So we are in constantly refreshing our portfolio, not only in the things that Doug described in terms of amenitization but also selling assets where we think we can get a a good price that may not have some of the characteristics he described. Operator : Your next response is from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Anthony Powell : Just a question on census. Where do you think that number goes to on a stabilized basis given we've seen more companies even that are backing office, say that employees can work from home on Fridays? And can census and I guess the leasing demand decouple in the future as tenants still want space but allow their employees a bit more flexibility? Mike LaBelle : I think the census -- the denominator of the census was the physical occupancy of the buildings the month before the pandemic started. So I think as we've been saying over and over again, we think our clients are going to return to the office but we also think hybrid work is going to be a bigger factor for many employers. And what we're also seeing for our clients that have returned to the office, most of them have a hybrid work option but they're saying to their employees, we got to have everybody in the office on certain days of the week. So the answer to your question is, I think our census should go back up to 100%, but it may not be every day of the week. It may only be in the middle of the week, Mondays and Fridays would probably be a little slower. Doug Linde : And just the only other thing I'd add is that over time, there maybe more spatial considerations given by our tenants, so they may actually have fewer people in their spaces, not because they're any less occupied but because they were so tight together and so densely packed and that given the issues associated with the pandemic and health security, and indoor air quality, and having people just feel comfortable in their spaces, they may actually have to either increase their space in order to maintain their same occupancy or they will have fewer badges at any one time because there just aren't going to be as many seats as they want to add. Anthony Powell : And maybe on Dock 72, seem like there's some momentum there. Can you talk about just conversations you've had with more tenants at Dock 72 and just the feeling around the building? Doug Linde : John Powers, do you want to take that? John Powers : Well, as Doug said, we did a deal. We're very happy with that transaction and we have a lease out for 192,000 feet. We have some action on the prebuilds and we've had more people coming to the Navy yard and seeing it, which is really what we need, because it's a fantastic building. Operator : Your next response is from Peter Abramowitz with Jefferies. Peter Abramowitz : Just sort of a high level strategy question here. Sort of as you're evaluating new markets, how do you think about Miami as a potential next market? Seems like a place that would kind of fit with your strategy of being coastal markets, maybe not as high barrier to entry as New York and California but certainly a more kind of business friendly environment and addition of demographic shifts that are kind of benefiting it as a result of the pandemic. So any thoughts of how you look at a market like that or any potential other markets where you might enter? Owen Thomas : We are very focused on the six coastal large gateway markets where we currently operate. We believe those markets have the largest clusters of knowledge workers that are important to the growth businesses that we serve, particularly in the technology and the life science sectors. We also see stronger barriers to new entry in those six markets, and that's where we're focused. And within that, we are building a life science business as well as an office business in many of those markets, and that's going to be our focus for the foreseeable future. Operator : Your next response is from Daniel Ismail with Green Street. Daniel Ismail : Doug, you touched on this earlier about how vacancy might change relative to markets. But is it your sense that leasing volume will reach pre-COVID levels in '22, or is that a '23 event? Doug Linde : I'll try and articulate what I've said in the past, which is that for the large tenants, what I would refer to as the tech titans and those tenants haven't left the market and they're going to continue to do what they were doing. And those are the kind of companies that Owens was describing they're looking for space down in Silicon Valley, and have made major expansions in the urban areas of all our markets. And then on the small side, tenants that are less than a [four], they are back doing exactly what they were otherwise doing. And so there is plenty of volume in that sector. I think the challenge is the companies that are thinking about what it is that hybrid means and how hybrid will work for them. And those companies will need to get their people back into a consistent in-person environment or understand what their employees want to do and what they want them to do. And that's going to take some time. And so I believe that 2022 will be a lighter year relative to absorption than pre-pandemic. And then in 2023 when the experiments have all run their courses and companies understand what their expectations are for human capital and physical capital that's when we will see, I believe, and I think Owen articulates as well the reasons why we'll see a very strong pickup in absorption and demand, gross demand. Daniel Ismail : And then maybe just last one, a bigger picture question. We've discussed high quality and ground up and renovated office buildings seeing strong pricing recently. But is it your sense there is any pricing differential between ground up construction and a fully renovated office building? And is there any difference in tenant demand between those two categories? Doug Linde : Are you talking about sales values or rental rates? Daniel Ismail : Sales value and then tenant demand as well. I guess they go hand-in-hand. Owen Thomas : I mean, I think it's a little bit dependent on the market that you're in. I mean let's take New York, for example. There's been strong technology demand on the West side and Midtown South, and a lot of the stock there ground up development, it has happened, but it's not as available. So there have been some very successful and interesting renovations of existing stock. I would say some of the best buildings in Midtown South are actually older buildings that have been renovated and we intend to make 360 Park Avenue South one of them. So I think it's very dependent on the local market, I think a very high quality older building that's been fully renovated in Midtown South is going to get equivalent pricing to something that's new. Doug Linde : And on the demand side, Danny, the only thing that you can't fix or change on a renovation is the structure. So everything else can basically go. You can literally rip off the facade and put a brand new energy efficient window system in, you can dramatically change the mechanical. You can even create new shafts for a larger duct work and change the mechanical equipment in the buildings. So if the building has a really challenged structural system, meaning lots and lots columns or a very low slab to slab, I think those are the impediments to a renovated building relative to new construction where you're going to see many fewer columns and you're going to see much larger volumes of space. But other than those two characteristics, a fabulous renovation of a building is going to get the same, I think, level of interest as a new construction building. Daniel Ismail : And then one more, if I may. You mentioned 360 Park Avenue. I believe you issued a few OP units to do that deal. Just the risk of higher pass throughs seems to be increasing. Is utilizing that structure increasing more in your discussions when you're out looking for new acquisitions? Owen Thomas : It is a very valuable structure that we can offer and it gives us, as a public company, a competitive advantage to be able to exchange OP units for a tax sensitive seller. And it's been a long time since the last OP unit deal. But I would say today that we are having dialogs with other owners of real estate about a similar structure. Doug Linde : I think it's very case specific, though. I would say, yes, the dialogues are higher, but I also wouldn't suggest the tidal wave of this activity either. Operator : Your next response is from Brent Dilts with UBS. Brent Dilts : Just could you talk about how demand for your Flex product has evolved this year, and where you see co-working demand going from here as physical occupancy improves? Owen Thomas : Bryan, do you want to talk about Flex by BXP? Bryan Koop : Our Flex from BXP in Boston got four locations and it\u2019s great stability throughout COVID. And we're starting to see some pickup in activity, but not really of the kind of that we'd be really proud to be saying has taken place pre-COVID. But we definitely have interest in it and we've got inquiries on it coming up. And mainly from corporate users versus entrepreneurs seems to be the theme, where it's a corporate use saying we're going to have a special project, what do you have in 2022 that we can take immediately. Owen Thomas : And I think in terms of the broader market, I would continue to reiterate what we've said in the past is we think flexible office space will be an important part of the office business going forward. We've seen in our own portfolio its value to small companies that just want space and they want it now and they want flexibility. And I also think larger corporates will see value in procuring a small percentage of their space on a flexible basis given their business often changes more rapidly than space can be delivered to them. But I think the first thing that has to happen in the market is roughly 2% to 3% of US office space today is flexible. It needs to refill. I mean that's the first thing that needs to happen. And then the question will be, if it's going to grow, how is it going to get financed. I'm not sure that operators are going to be financing additional growth of flexible office space. I think it's going to be the landlords and where, and when, and how much will they elect to do going forward. And I think we'll see -- I don't think those decisions will need to be answered for the next year or so. Brent Dilts : And then just one other one here. I heard your comments on physical occupancy, maybe not being the same as card counts and stuff in the future. So as companies have been returning employees to the office in bigger numbers, has there been any increase in those tenants making changes to floor plans or amenities? And just related to that, are there any new tenants in the portfolio requesting anything in terms of build out that's been different versus pre-COVID? Doug Linde : So I am surprised that I'm going to say what I'm saying, which is we've seen virtually no existing tenants do anything that requires a building permit. That doesn't mean that they aren't moving furniture around or they're not eliminating workstations or they're converting small chat rooms into offices, we don't know if that's going on or not. But to date, the the energy has been on simply getting people to get comfortable coming back into their office environment not changing the physical infrastructure. And again, even the companies are saying, hey, we want you back, it's going to take some time for those companies to get all of their employees to come back on a consistent basis. And I think it's at that point that they will have a better understanding of their space needs to be organized to effectively fit the way they want their people to be working when they are in person. Operator : Your next question is from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Jamie Feldman : I just want to go back to your last answer on Flex office. Now that we've seen WeWork as a public company, they are one of your largest tenants. I mean do you think they're going to grow in the portfolio going forward? Just how do you think your BXP and WeWork will function together going forward? Owen Thomas : Well, we have a great relationship with them. We're delighted that they were able to go public. And we have, I believe, five different stores with them right now and we're going to have to see how their success evolves and the whole Flex market evolves. As I mentioned a minute ago, the flexible space is less occupied and there needs to be some recovery of that market before we could consider additional growth. So we will consider in the future but I think that's at least a year off. Jamie Feldman : Are there characteristics of the flex office leases that you're seeing more tenants request in terms of duration or breaks, or anything like that? Doug Linde : So Jamie, the reason that we did our own flex space was because we have enough volume of space in our portfolio where we wanted to be able to satisfy those customers who basically said. We don't want to think about anything other than can we be in the space tomorrow and we don't have to buy furniture, we don't have to buy technology services, we don't have to do anything other than bring our people in and go. And so that was the nature of the experiment that we have doing been with our spaces. I would tell you that we continue to see requests from small companies for, hey, what do you have for me, I'm looking for some short-term space. And that's exactly what our Flex product should be about. What we are not doing and don't have any intention of doing is taking large pieces of our space and converting it to Flex space and competing with WeWork or any of the other flexible space operators for corporate users who are looking for large blocks of space, because that's just part of their strategy. That's not what we're going to be doing. Relative to where our buildings are and the amenitization we have, I think that's the attraction of why the companies that are in our spaces have gone there is because you can go to the Prudential Center, or you can go to the Hub on Causeway, or you can go to 100 Federal Street and get the advantage of all the amenitization and the great place and space making that we have done and do it on a short term basis, if that's what your business strategy calls for. Owen Thomas : I mean I think the decision to grow from our seat is really two things. One is what Doug is describing, which is, is this something we should just have to attract more customers, particularly where we have a high concentration of office space like at the Pru or at Reston or Embarcadero Center? If you're building an apartment building, you don't just build single bedrooms. You have studios and two bedrooms. So this is a different product. And is it valuable to have that product at one of our facilities? And also, by the way, does it create tenants that might move, become successful and bigger and then like being at the Pru, for example, and become a longer term customer? So that's one question. Then the second question is what's the math? And that's a big question, because you have to do turnkey build-out, cost hundreds of dollars a square foot. You face vacancy, because you don't have long term leases and you have to understand what the math looks like. Bryan Koop : Yes, 100% of what Doug said on our corporate users is evidenced at the Hub. So we've got a full floor in the last space that is flex space. And 100% of our clients in there are users in the buildings and they tend to be special project related for six to one year in term. And as a great example is we have a e-gaming division in one of the units that's a subsidiary of one of our clients up above. So the Hub is a great example. It's 100% of our clientele in that one. In other locations, it's probably 50% to 60% but it tends to be longer in term, not month-to-month. And then again, our Flex product is totally different than co-working. We're not doing co-working. These are spaces that are prebuilt and we have no social aspects to the needs of our clients, they do that. Jamie Feldman : And then I guess just some housekeeping questions for Mike on the guidance. What are you assuming for leasing spreads? And then can you talk about CapEx next year and maybe to help us get to like an AFFO number? Mike LaBelle : So I mean, look, leasing spreads, it's not going to change that dramatically. Boston and San Francisco, spreads are going to be up in our view. And the deals that Doug talked about that we're doing in San Francisco this quarter and the things that we have under discussion are going to be rolled up. Same thing with Boston and Cambridge and the suburbs. I think Reston will be closer to flat, maybe slightly up on the leasing that we do. And New York City is going to be a little bit more volatile, because it really depends on the space. We have certain spaces that are going to be rolled out in certain spaces that are going to be rolled up. So I think you will see more volatility in New York City there. With respect to kind of AFFO, if you look at '21 and we've got three quarters in the books, I mean, I think our AFFO is getting pretty close to where it was in 2019, honestly. We have a shot of getting to, I think it was $4.43 a share in 2019. So I think we have a shot of getting there. We maybe slightly below. And looking out at 2022, I would say, on the CapEx side, probably pretty similar to what we're seeing this year, which is $100 million, maybe $120 million max in kind of CapEx. Leasing costs, they're running somewhere in the mid-200s on an annual basis, which is not that significantly different than what they've been in '21 and prior years. And then we've got a lot of, obviously, free rent burning off. Our noncash rent is going to be slightly lower than we guided for 2020 one, and we gave that guidance is $90 million to $110 million of noncash rent, but there's a lot of free rent burning off. And then you have other noncash items that go the other way like stock comp and fair value ground lease rent and things like that, that's about $75 million the other way. So the way I kind of look at it is, if you want to add up all those adjustments, there's probably $370 million to $400 million of adjustments off of our FFO. So that's $2.25 a share. So that will drive you to 2022 to an AFFO that's around $5, which is up significantly from where we'll be in '21, but also from where it was in 2019 pre-COVID , because of all the cash NOI growth we've had and developments that have come in and are increasing our cash NOI. So I think it's a very positive story. Jamie Feldman : And then how do you think about just dividend coverage and growth? Mike LaBelle : Well, I mean, I think as our cash NOI goes up, you're going to see our dividend coverage improve. Obviously, it's been pretty tight for the first quarter and second quarter. Our FAD ratio has been in the high 90s. It went way down this quarter. It was like 72% because as kind of Doug talked about, our transaction costs were lower this quarter, which helped us. And as our FFO grows and our cash NOI grows, it's going to improve and improve. At this point, we haven't made any decisions about a dividend policy or strategy going forward but it's certainly something we'll be discussing with the Board on a quarterly basis as this cash NOI comes in. Operator : There are no further questions in the queue at this time. Owen Thomas : Okay. Operator, thank you. That concludes management's remarks and thank all of you for your interest in Boston Properties. Have a good day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

I\u2019d like to welcome Owen Thomas, Chief Executive Officer; Doug Linde, President; and Mike LaBelle, Chief Financial Officer. During our Q&A portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, Senior Executive Vice President, and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks. Owen Thomas : Thank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019d like to start by introducing Helen Han, who is our new Head of Investor Relations. Helen was formerly Head of Marketing for our western region has been with BXP for over 15 years and has a deep wealth of knowledge about our company and people. Welcome, Helen, great to have you here. So today, I am going to cover BXP\u2019s operating momentum, the economic conditions that serve as a backdrop for BXP\u2019s operations as we enter 2022, the current private equity capital market conditions for office real estate as well as BXP\u2019s capital allocation activities and growth potential. BXP\u2019s financial results for the fourth quarter reflect the impact of the recovering U.S. economy and increasing needs for our clients for securing high quality office space. Our FFO per share this quarter was above market consensus and the midpoint of our guidance. We completed 1.8 million square feet of leasing, our third consecutive quarter of significantly higher leasing activity. It was 55% above the fourth quarter of 2020 and in line with our pre-pandemic leasing level. With an average term of 8.6 years on the leases signed this past quarter, lease commitments by our clients continue to be long-term in nature. This success can be attributed to not only our execution, but also the enhanced velocity and economics achieved in the current marketplace for premium quality assets with great amenities and transit access, which are the hallmarks of BXP strategy and portfolio. Now turning to 2022, we believe the market and economic factors which impact BXP are on balance very favorable. Though the Omicron variant has been a setback in the course of the pandemic has proven hard to forecast, most experts believe conditions will improve in 2022, resulting in more workers returning to the office and further improved space demand. The economic recovery in the U.S. continues with consensus GDP growth predicted to be 4% in 2022 and innovations in technology and life science remain promising and well funded, a key driver for office and lab space demand. Capital flows into the real estate sector will also likely grow further, as investors, one, rebalance their portfolios away from equities due to strong performance from the lows of the pandemic; and two, have a reluctance to allocate these funds to fixed income due to rising interest rates. New office supply is also slowed down given the demand uncertainties created by the pandemic another long-term positive for the office business. Moving to the challenges, interest rates are raising, which will likely continue due to the Feds current focus on inflation and signaling, it will raise the Fed funds rate multiple times in 2022. BXP had significant and well timed refinancing activity in 2021, and therefore faces limited debt financing needs in the coming year. Inflation is a greater challenge and has several dimensions. Rising construction cost will require higher rental rates to make development feasible. However, over time, higher replacement costs should increase the value of our existing portfolio of buildings. The labor market is also very tight, which contributes to our client\u2019s hesitancy, and bringing their employees back to an in-person work environment. As we have stated repeatedly, we believe this phenomenon will change over time given widespread corporate dissatisfaction with a decaying of efficiency, retention and culture associated with remote work. Though challenges persist we see 2022 market conditions as a favorable backdrop for BXP to continue to perform. So moving to the real estate capital markets an all time record of commercial real estate sales volume was achieved in the fourth quarter and private capital market activity for office assets was similarly robust. $39 billion of significant office assets were sold in the fourth quarter, up 35% from the previous quarter and up 90% from the fourth quarter a year ago. Cap rates are stable or declining for assets with limited lease rollover and anything life science related, and activity is increasing for assets facing near-term lease expirations. The Boston market was particularly active with 2 major life science recapitalization deals in Cambridge selling for around $2,200 a square foot and sub 4% cap rates. 3 significant deals in the Seaport District selling for approximately $1,500 a foot on a fee simple basis with cap rates at or below 4%. And 2 CBD sales at $700 to $950 a square foot with cap rates in the low 4% range. Notably in New York City, 2 major assets in the Hudson Yards area sold in full or part for an average of approximately $1,400 a square foot and cap rates of 4.5% to 5% on a stabilized basis. In the District of Columbia, 4 transactions completed aggregating $750 million with pricing averaging approximately $550 to $600 a square foot on a fee simple basis and cap rates in the low 5% range. And pricing in Seattle continues to escalate with deals closed or announced and South Lake Union priced above $1,200 a square foot a new local record and a sub 4% cap rate, in Fremont at over $1,000 a foot and a low 4% cap rate, and in the CBD at around $750 a square foot and mid 4% cap rate. Regarding BXP\u2019s capital market activity and starting with acquisitions, we closed on the previously described 360 Park Avenue South acquisition in New York City in December and placed the project into our active development pipeline. 2 of our strategic capital program partners will co-invest in the deal if capital is drawn for redevelopment bringing our interest to 42% on a stabilized basis. We continue to have elevating dialogues with potential private equity partners are pursuing an active pipeline of both on and off market deals in many of our markets and anticipate additional acquisition activity of value add assets with capital partners in 2022. In 2021, we also completed noncore asset sales of $225 million and anticipate higher disposition volumes in 2022. We completed a very active quarter with our development pipeline we delivered fully into service 100 Causeway Street in Boston, the Marriott headquarters at 7750 Wisconsin Avenue in Bethesda, and the lab conversion project at 200 West Street in Waltham. In the aggregate, BXP share of these projects represents 1.5 million square feet of development and $460 million of investment. The 3 assets or 98% leased being delivered below budget and ahead of schedule at a projected stabilized cash yield in excess of 8% and are projected to add $41 million to our NOI on a stabilized basis. Given the market cap rates are previously described for high quality office a 4% to 5%, we expect these projects in the aggregate will create approximately $380 million of value above our $460 million in cost for BXP shareholders. Also, we partially placed into service Reston Next in Reston. And we are continuously refreshing our development pipeline by adding just this past quarter 360 Park Avenue South and 103 CityPoint, a speculative ground up lab development aggregating 113,000 square feet in our CityPoint development in Waltham. We have a very active pipeline of office and lab developments and redevelopments ready to announce when they commence expected later in 2022, and Doug will describe the strong leasing success we are achieving with our lab development. After all these movements, our current development pipeline aggregates 3.4 million square feet and $2.5 billion of investment is already 59% leased, and projected to add approximately $190 million to our NOI over the next 3 years. So in summary, we had another active and successful quarter with strong leasing and financial returns, and are excited for our prospects for continued growth in 2022. We expect significant growth in our FFO per share this year driven by improving economic conditions and leasing activity, continued recovery of variable revenue streams, delivery of a well lease development pipeline, completion of 4 new acquisitions in 2021, a strong balance sheet combined with capital allocated from large scale private equity partners to pursue additional new investment opportunities as the pandemic recedes, a rapidly expanding life science portfolio in the nation\u2019s hottest life science markets and well timed refinancing activity in 2021 and lower capital costs. So with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Doug. Douglas Linde : Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. Hope you all had a good new year. I\u2019m going to focus my remarks this morning on our leasing activity. As was evident in the second press release, we set on last night, our leasing activity press release, we had a pretty strong fourth quarter with activity spread around Boston, New York, San Francisco and the metropolitan Washington DC regions. We ended the year with an occupancy pick up of about 40 basis points. As we sit here today in the end of January, we have signed leases for our in-service portfolio that have yet to commence, so they\u2019re not in our occupancy figures of more than 925,000 square feet; that 925,000 square feet represents an additional 180 basis points of potential occupancy increase, and includes about 115,000 square feet of 2023 commencement so the majority of it is 2022. We begin 2022 with over 1.4 million square feet of leases in negotiation on space in the in-service portfolio, more than 425,000 covers currently vacant space, and about 450,000 covers 2022 expirations. During 2022, we have about 2.8 million square feet of expirations in the in-service portfolio. Over the last decade, total leasing for this company has ranged between 3.7 million square feet in 2020. So that\u2019s in the midst of the early pandemic and the economic shutdown and over 7.7 million square feet in those years, where we\u2019ve signed some pretty large built those leases. Now, it\u2019s true some of the leasing we do each year encompasses early renewals, and we\u2019ll talk about some of that today and leases on new developments. But a significant portion of this leasing we do each year is our near-term renewals in available space in the portfolio. So with 2.8 million square feet of exposure, 925,000 square feet of signed leases, 1.4 million in January of deals in the works so for 2.35 million square feet and with an annual expected leasing probably somewhere between $3.7 million and $7.7 million. We believe our occupancy is on an upward trajectory as we enter 2022. The second generation statistics this quarter merit a little granular explanation. San Francisco is flat and due to a 50,000 square foot lease down at our North first project, where we are doing short-term deals with kick outs to allow us the flexibility to commence construction on the Station project. The EC leases, so our CBD portfolio had a roll up of 13%, if you take out that 50,000 square foot lease. In New York City, we terminated a lease with Citibank and went direct with their subtending, which is operating in conference center, the new rent for that floor is discounted. But Citi made us whole through a cash termination payment, excluding that New York City had a 5% roll up. Now there\u2019s no question that Omicron and the way that hit us in November, slowed some return to office dates. However, none of the leases that we have in negotiation have been delayed or impacted by a change in our customers need for space. While the month of December and the first 2 weeks of January were slow, our leasing teams have had a very busy few weeks with more signed LOIs and more active discussions. I would note that the vast majority of those conversations in our CBD locations have continued to be from the financial services and professional services sectors, and that very well may be due to the function of the space that we actually have available in our portfolio. The only area of our business where we\u2019ve seen a slight Omicron blip is on parking revenue. Transient collections are down modestly from our forecast for the month of January. And we haven\u2019t quite achieved the same anticipated pickup that we thought we would in monthly permits. But we believe that this will be short lived and we\u2019ll start to see our projections turn in February. I want to provide a few observations about our regional activities. Let\u2019s start with suburban Boston life sciences. We broke ground on our 880 Winter Street, 243,000 square foot lab conversion in July of 2021, 7 months ago. We\u2019ve signed leases for 165,000 square feet, and we are in negotiation for all of the remaining lab space. The first tenant is expected to occupy during the back half of 2022. Net rents are up 20% from our initial underwriting in March of 2021. At 180 CityPoint when negotiating a lease for about 50% of the new 329,000 square foot building, steel erection hasn\u2019t started yet, we\u2019re expecting it\u2019s going to start next month, and we\u2019re hopeful to deliver the space in the fourth quarter of 2023, but the leasing success that demonstrates what\u2019s going on in the market. We are eagerly awaiting the November expiration of our leases in the Second Avenue buildings we purchased last June, we can offer 140,000 square feet of lab space and expect a significant roll up in rents with demand continuing to outpace supply. We will commence construction as Owen said on another 113,000 square feet at CityPoint, which is in our supplemental we\u2019re calling it 103 CityPoint, very clever. Construction drawings are complete, and we expect to break ground this quarter with a late 2024 delivery there. Now, our traditional Route 120 office leasing is also extremely busy. There is office demand out there. This quarter we agreed to recapture and re-lease 1265 Main Street 120,000 square foot office building at CityPoint in Waltham. We completed a 10-year lease as is with a 21% increase in the net rent. At 140 Kendrick Street in Needham, we\u2019ve announced Wellington\u2019s commitment to lease 105,000 square feet, and we found a way to reposition the building as a net zero installation, which was extremely important to both BXP in Wellington. In addition, we have commitments for 2 other tenants, so the remaining 80,000 square feet of this project which is currently under lease and expires in November of 2022. And finally, we\u2019re working on another 73,000 square foot early recapture and backfill at our CityPoint complex. This totals 378,000 square feet of traditional suburban office leases. These transactions will have rent roll ups between 7% and 40% on a cash basis. Our CBD Boston activity this quarter was primarily small transactions. We completed 12 deals for 80,000 square feet. The average markup was 17% on a cash basis. At the moment, there are few large office requirements in the Boston CBD and there is going to be new construction deliveries in 2023. Our largest block of CBD space and exposure is at 100 Federal Street where will we be getting back 150,000 square feet in early 2023. In New York City during the quarter, we had activity across the portfolio. We executed full floor lease at Dock 72. We completed 108,000 square foot lease at Times Square tower. We completed more than 180,000 square feet of leases at 601 Lex, 42,000 square feet at 250 West 55th, 89,000 at the General Motors Building and over 120,000 square feet in Princeton, the individual mark to market in New York vary greatly. You\u2019ll recall the single floor I called out last quarter which really retarded our statistics, where the rent went down by 50%. Well, we signed that 15-year lease extension for that floor and the rent is now up 71% on a cash basis. The leases we completed that the General Motors Building were flat, while the leases at 250 West 55th Street range from up 2% to down 19% on a cash basis. Our current activity in New York continues to be strong. We have multi floor lease negotiations underway at GM, 601 Lex, and 510 Madison along with a number of smaller transactions in those buildings. Total activity is in excess of 525,000 square feet. As Owen discussed, we completed the purchase of 360 Park Avenue South, we are working to complete our base building system modification plans as well as our amenities program. And even though we haven\u2019t formally begun to market the asset, we have been responding to inquiries and tours. Physical construction work will commence during the month of February, so in a couple of weeks. In the San Francisco CBD, large tech demand has largely been absent from the market other than companies upgrading their space through opportunities, opportunistic sublet space at buildings like our 680 Folsom, the Macy\u2019s in the Riverbend subleases and at 350 Mission were sales force sublet. The bulk of the activity on a direct basis has been in the financial district, and it has been confined to the better buildings with professional services and financial firms. We went out on this quarter, and we asked John Cecconi and his team from CBRE who does work for us to segment the premier buildings in the city. People can debate whether it\u2019s the perfect list or not, but it total 20 million square feet are about 23% of the market and includes our entire CBD portfolio. The current vacancy in this portfolio of 20 million square feet is 5.3%. And if you add sublet space it grows to about 8%. Now I\u2019ve made the point before but you can\u2019t simply look at the overall market availability statistics and make assumptions about where rents and concessions might be in this market. We completed 112,000 square feet of CBD deals this quarter, and our cash rents increased by 7% with an average starting rent of $103 a square foot. Similar to our lab success in Boston, our venture with ARE successfully executed a full building lab lease at 751 Gateway in South San Francisco. The venture intends to commence the conversion of 651 Gateway to a life science building over the next few months. The advantage for this project is time to delivery relative to a new building where we can save 6 months off versus ground up construction. Last quarter, I described our efforts to gauge pricing as we consider the restart of Platform 16 in San Jose. Our total base building construction costs increased just over 13% relative to the pricing we had 24 months ago. We continue to see meaningful cost increases and material availability issues across all trades in all of our markets. As an example, the lead time on base building mechanical systems once you have approved drawings has doubled from 20 weeks to 40 weeks, which means you have to make decisions much earlier in a construction schedule or risk delays, we\u2019re doing that. The Class A Silicon Valley leasing markets had a particularly strong 2021 with a very healthy net absorption. And just last week we got wind of another 500,000 square foot office kind of expansion, not one of what we refer to as the Tech Titans in the Northern Peninsula. And Platform 16, if we start won\u2019t deliver until early 2025. I\u2019m going to finish my remarks this morning on Greater Washington. During the fourth quarter, we completed 11 office leases in Reston totaling over 140,000 square feet. Every deal was on previously vacant space. Rents have held firm in the low-50s with 2.5% annual bump to the low-60s with similar bumps for our new project at RTC Next. The first phase of RTC Next has been delivered to Fannie Mae as Owen described, and we completed our first non-anchor lease during the quarter. This project is 85% lease, it is transformative to the Rest and Skyline and it\u2019s a 5-minute walk to the heart of the town center retail where we completed over 60,000 square feet of retail leasing, again with new tenants on currently vacant space. In the district, we continue to chip away at our current availability with our JV assets with about 100,000 square feet of leasing. We\u2019ve delivered 2100 Penn to our anchor tenant for their tenant improvements, and we\u2019re working on filling the remainder of that building. In Boston, in the New York and in the metropolitan DC area, we have seen a swift reduction in COVID related cases. Our daily tenant activity is starting to rise again. Employers continue to search for new employees. To circle back to Owen\u2019s comments about quality, employers are going to want to use their physical space to encourage their teams to be together. Our mantra has been to create great places and great spaces to allow our customers to use space as a way to attract and retain their talent. If you believe that employees may be spending less time in their office, it\u2019s even more important to have the right space and place when they are here. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike. Michael LaBelle : Great. Thank you, Doug. Good morning, everybody. So this morning, I plan to cover the details of our fourth quarter performance and the changes to our 2022 earnings guidance. For the fourth quarter we announced funds from operations of $1.55 per share, which exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.05 per share and was $0.03 per share above consensus estimates. The performance of our portfolio drove $0.04 of the improvement and higher than projected management and development fees added $0.01. I would place the portfolio outperformance in 4 buckets. First, income from earlier than anticipated leasing, particularly in San Francisco and Reston. In San Francisco we executed 2 10-year renewals aggregating 65,000 square feet at a significant pickup in rent and several smaller new leases with immediate delivery. And in Reston, we signed a 90,000 square foot new lease with a technology company with space delivery on lease signing. We also collected payments from several tenants on receivables that we had written off in 2020. Second, we achieved higher service income due to an increase in utilization from better physical occupancy in New York City during the quarter. Just prior to the impact of the Omicron variant, our New York City portfolio census was running close to 70%, which represented a big pickup from the third quarter. Third, we experienced stronger parking revenue and hotel performance. Parking revenue totaled $23 million for the quarter, up 8% from the third quarter. It\u2019s now running at 82% of its pre-pandemic rate. So that means there\u2019s an incremental $20 million or $0.11 per share on an annual basis, we should be able to recapture to reach prior levels. Our hotel operated at 50% occupancy during the quarter for the full year 2021, it operated just above breakeven, only contributing $600,000 to our FFO. This compares to its contribution in 2019 of $15 million, a difference of $0.08 per share that we should recover in the next couple of years. And fourth, we recognized income from the delivery of the 733,000 square foot Marriott World Headquarters development a month earlier than we anticipated. In addition to delivering it early, our cost came in well below budget, so its investment return profile is exceeding our expectations as well. The last item I would like to mention about the quarter is a reminder that as we guided last quarter we incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.25 per share for the redemption of our $1 billion of 3.85% senior notes that were due to expire in early 2023. We funded the redemption with an $850 million, 2.45% senior notes issuance in the third quarter. This was an opportunistic trade due to our views that interest rates were likely climbing. We feel good about our decision as rates have increased by about 50 basis points since we locked in at a 1.3% 10-year treasury rate. We made a similar decision with our $1 billion mortgage refinancing on 601 Lexington Avenue that we closed this quarter at a 2.79% coupon for 10 years. The underlying loan carried an interest rate of 4.75% and was not expiring until April of 2022. But we had the opportunity to pay it off with no penalty starting in December of 2021. We closed it on the first day available and priced off a 1.48% 10-year treasury rate again significantly lower than current rates. Despite increasing the mortgage by approximately $400 million, we will see lower interest expense due to the 200 basis point reduction in the overall coupon. And as Owen mentioned we now have limited debt expirations over the next couple of years. Now, I\u2019d like to turn to 2022. Doug described the leasing activity we are seeing heading into the year which adds to the confidence we have in our growth profile. As a result, we\u2019re increasing our FFO guidance range to $7.30 to $7.45 per share for 2022. Our new midpoint is $7.38 per share, and it\u2019s $0.03 higher than last quarter. The increase is coming from higher projected contribution from the in-service portfolio, as well as higher anticipated development fee income. You will notice that we brought down our same property NOI growth by 25 basis points this quarter, which might appear inconsistent with an increase in our guidance. The reduction is primarily due to the stronger performance we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2021, which increased our starting point. This includes the earlier than projected leasing in Q4 that is reflected in our higher occupancy, one-time cash receipts from our collections, and higher than expected service income, where our future projections are more conservative. In addition, Doug described 2 lease recaptures in our suburban Boston portfolio, where we have new tenants coming in at higher rents, but we will have some downtime between leases. The rent during the downtime is being covered by the exiting tenants, but that\u2019s recognized as termination income, which is excluded from our same property income. All of these are positive results. We only brought down the top end of the range, so in effect the bottom end is actually higher. Our new assumption for 2022 same property NOI growth is 2% to 3% from 2021. We also reduced our assumption for 2022 cash same property NOI growth, and our new range is 5% to 6%, which represents strong growth year-over-year. The only other meaningful change to our guidance is an increase in our assumption for development fee revenue to $24 million to $30 million, an increase of $2 million. The improvement relates to additions to our development pipeline at 651 Gateway and 360 Park Avenue South. Overall, we continue to project strong FFO growth of more than 12% in 2022 from 2021 at the midpoint of our range. We expect our near-term growth to come primarily from delivering new office and life science developments and our 2021 acquisition program. These are expected to add an incremental $0.43 per share, or 6.5% to our 2022 FFO at the midpoint. Our guidance does not assume any new acquisitions in 2022. We also projected benefit from our well timed refinancing activity last year, resulting in $0.35 per share of lower interest expense and debt extinguishment costs in 2022 at the midpoint of our range. For the first quarter of 2022, we\u2019re providing guidance for funds from operations of $1.72 to $1.74 per share. As a reminder, our first quarter results are always lower due to the timing associated with stock vesting and payroll taxes plus the seasonality of our hotel. In summary, we remain confident in the growth trajectory of our business. We\u2019re seeing strong leasing activity in our portfolio that we expect to result in occupancy and income gains in 2022 and 2023. In addition to the $2.5 billion of existing development we have underway that we will deliver over the next 2 years, we have numerous sites under ownership where we\u2019re working towards new starts in the coming months. That completes our formal remarks. Operator, can you open up the lines to question. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And, sir, we have our first question from Manny Korchman from Citi. You may ask your question. Michael Bilerman : Great. It\u2019s Michael Bellman here with Manny. Owen, if I can get your opinion, Boston Properties has always been focused on the highest quality office space, the highest quality building from the top markets, which has been very good for the company over the history. As we think about going post-pandemic, you talked about the desire of companies to have great space to encourage and provide a reason for their employees to come back. How do you think this bifurcation in the marketplace is going to play out in terms of the types of spaces that you own today and then AA plus arena, and then everything else, and because that Class AA plus is a minority of the entire office stock? How do you think all of that Class B and C office space will trend? Is it just going to be a rent inducement, which may depress rents overall? Or are you just going to need a substantial amount of capital to redevelop those assets either into more modern office space, or into other property types? And how do you think all of that\u2019s going to ultimately affect the broader office market? Owen Thomas : Yeah. A lot there to unpack, Michael, but I\u2019ll do my best. So agree with what you said at the outset, BXP strategy back to our founders is to have great buildings and great locations, we say it today more great place and space. It\u2019s always been a hallmark of the company strategy. It\u2019s always worked, and it\u2019s actually even more important, because of the pandemic. Doug and I, in our remarks kind of articulated, what you said, which is we do think companies are going to return to the office, we do think hybrid is here to stay. And we do think it\u2019s going to be very important for CEOs and company leadership to have great offices that their employees want to work in. So having buildings that have great amenities that are located near transit, all those things are going to be increasingly important to entice workers to come back to the office. So I think the bifurcation between the top of the market and the rest of the market is growing right now, and it\u2019s going to grow further. Doug gave you the very interesting stat on San Francisco, the aggregate availability stats on San Francisco are 27%. And he gave you the data on the top 20% of the market, which is actually 5% vacant, that\u2019s incredible, if you think about it. So the bifurcation is increasing. So now coming to your question, what\u2019s going to happen with the more modest quality buildings, I think it\u2019s very case by case, building by building, city by city, and neighborhood by neighborhood, I do think the office markets will recover, the economy will grow, some of those buildings will get leased as office, I do think it\u2019s going to be very competitive, and probably harder to push rents. Land in places like Manhattan is incredibly valuable, so there could be a reuse of a lot of these properties. I mean, office, many offices that were created for large corporate users have large floor plates, and they don\u2019t \u2013 they\u2019re not very well suited for conversion to residential, because of the bay depth, but there are exceptions to that. And I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll see creative developers, change some of these buildings to residential, some may get torn down and made into something else. Some may be made into \u2013 there have been buildings in New York that have been renovated, where setbacks were put into an older building and floor is added to the top. So there\u2019ll be a lot of creativity that goes into it. And I think slowly over time, you\u2019ll see some conversion of this stock, and between the economy growing and some stock being taken offline, I think the markets will ultimately firm up. But this bifurcation between quality and commodity is going to continue and widen. Emmanuel Korchman : Hey, guys, it\u2019s Manny here. Just, Mike, I have a question for you, if I think about your guidance, in totality, I think everything you mentioned on the call today was a positive in a lift to guidance, notwithstanding the ranges given a better 2021. Now, what are the negatives offsetting some of that, because if I add together all the positives, I\u2019m getting more lift than sort of the lift to your midpoint? So are there negatives, we need to think about? Is it something else within the range that\u2019s keeping you from raising more? Or is it just conservatism like how do we think about that? Thanks. Michael LaBelle : Look, I mean, sure, there\u2019s conservatism in this environment. I mean, we\u2019re delighted to see the increase in the leasing activity. And that leasing activity that Doug is talking about is \u2013 will result in signed leases, but the question for us is, when did those leases go into occupancy? And so how much of that goes into 2022? And how much of it is a little bit later? Because in many cases, we have to wait until the tenants build out the space to start recognizing revenue on these spaces. So we have to judge how long that is going to take. So I think our trends are very positive. But the sales cycle and the build out cycle is not immediate, in all cases. So we have to judge that into our guidance. So I think that\u2019s part of it. We brought up the low-end of our guidance pretty significantly. The reason that we\u2019re doing that is some of the activity that we\u2019re seeing and getting leads us to the computation that we don\u2019t believe it\u2019s possible to be at that low end that we had before, because we\u2019ve gotten some of the stuff. We haven\u2019t gotten enough at this point to feel like we should be increasing the high ends, so we\u2019ve kept the high end where it is. And so that\u2019s how we kind of build our guidance ranges. There really hasn\u2019t been any kind of meaningful negative occurrences that are in our guidance. We talked a little bit about the same store, which is mostly due to positive things that happened. So there\u2019s really no negative occurrences that we put in any of the items that we put in our guidance that were at all meaningful. Emmanuel Korchman : Right. Thanks very much. Operator : And, sir, we have our next question from Nick Yulico of Scotiabank. You may ask your question. Nicholas Yulico : Thanks. I just had first a question or maybe you can give us a feel for what the rent spreads were on new signings, not just the commenced statistics that you give for the fourth quarter? Douglas Linde : Okay. I thought I did that all the way along. If you just sort of go back and look at my remarks, I basically said that, leases that we signed this quarter were, I think I said, between 7% and 14%, in the greater suburban Boston market, it was up 5% plus or minus in certainly the assets in New York City and flat in other assets in New York City, 7% in Embarcadero Center, Washington DC, the issue is that all the space that we leased was vacant. So you can\u2019t have a mark up on a vacant space, obviously, because it\u2019s infinite. So in general labor, trending positive, call it 2%, at 250 West 55th Street in some leases and negative 70% on a couple of other leases to positive 71% on the lease that we signed at 601 Lexington Avenue with the tenant that had short-term space today that we kind of good deal on for them a year ago, so it was really variable, but in net-net, it was all positive. Nicholas Yulico : Okay. Thanks, Doug. Second question is just going back to San Francisco. And you kind of have this interesting dynamic going on there where your rents are up at Embarcadero Center, even look like they\u2019re up, average rents and the buildings up versus the end of 2019 at this point yet. The occupancy is down \u2013 it\u2019s down \u2013 looks like it\u2019s down like over 700 basis points on average for those buildings. So sort of worse than the overall portfolio also looks like the vacancy there is around 11% for those buildings, which I\u2019m trying to square away with when you talk about 5% vacancy for some of the premier buildings in San Francisco. And so, I\u2019m just trying to understand like what\u2019s going on with those buildings and versus the market out there? Douglas Linde : So just to sort of refresh what I said, so the top call it, 20 million square feet of space includes the vacancy at Embarcadero Center, so that\u2019s in that statistic of 5% overall for that quote unquote, portfolio of premier buildings. The vast majority of our availability at Embarcadero Center with a low rise of EC 1 in the low rise EC 2. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have very much in the way of blocks of space, so it\u2019s a floor here and a floor there. We have activity on some of that space, some of that space is needs to be fully demolished, because it\u2019s got in some cases had the best from the original user of the space 25 years ago, and where the tenant moved out and some of it is a space with just an installation, that doesn\u2019t make sense anymore. We will make hay on some of that space during 2022. We don\u2019t have ROCE projections for getting to 5% availability in those buildings in during the year. But we\u2019re pretty confident that the space is going to lease at healthy rent. Obviously, low rise Embarcadero Center 1 is different than the top of EC 4, right. So the there\u2019s a rent differential between those 2 kinds of space. Nicholas Yulico : Okay. Really helpful. Thank you. Operator : And, sir, our next question from Craig Mailman of KeyBanc Capital Markets. You may ask your question. Craig Mailman : Thanks. Mike, maybe just a follow-up. How much of that $0.04 kind of upside in the quarter was from the collection of payments? And how big is that bucket as we headed to 2022? Michael LaBelle : I would say it was close to $0.01 for the quarter. And, I don\u2019t think I can tell you right now exactly how big that is, we\u2019re not assuming that we\u2019re going to be really collecting anything more. So I\u2019m not looking at anything that I don\u2019t \u2013 that I think is significant that would be coming in 2022 on collections. So, we\u2019re projecting zero effectively for that number. But I wouldn\u2019t say that, the one thing that could happen in 2022 is the return to accrual of some of the tenants that are non-accrual. And we\u2019re not projecting any of that either, but we\u2019re watching these tenants, some of the retail tenants and other tenants that we have, that we\u2019re not accruing rent for right now, as they continue to kind of be successful and pay rent and generate sales. There\u2019s the ability for us to bring those tenants back to accrual, which will in certain cases have an impact on our earnings, although be a non-cash impact on our earnings, it just bringing back kind of a former straight line. So that\u2019s another impact that will come \u2013 some of the things that happened in last few years. Craig Mailman : Okay, so you don\u2019t necessarily need to do a blend and extend. You just have to feel better about their ability to pay for the flip back to accrual? Michael LaBelle : Yeah, I mean, we may do an analysis and make judgments every quarter on all the tenants that we wrote up their accrue rent balances in 2020. And try to figure out when the right time when it\u2019s justified for us to bring them back. Douglas Linde : I think, Mike talked about in the past that there are sort of 3 primary buckets of tenants that are in that those areas co-working is one, it\u2019s the largest. Then what I guess you would refer to as entertainment retail, so we have a number of cinema operators in all of our markets that we\u2019re on nonaccrual with. And then we have a number of local operators, mostly in the food and beverage that still are struggling relative to where they were in 2019 from a revenue perspective, because of the lack of foot traffic in certain parts of the country. Craig Mailman : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, just separately, it seems like you guys got approvals at the FDA side or continues to move along. Can you just kind of give us some thoughts on how to think about maybe that site or in general, how you guys are thinking about developments here, as construction costs are rising, rents on, new space are holding steady, but kind of just your thoughts on what required returns to be to think about starting that in more near and medium term? Douglas Linde : So let me give you a general comment. And then I\u2019ll ask Hilary, who was officially here as our new regional leader in New York to comment on 343 Madison Avenue. So it is quite clear that construction costs have been going up at, call it, very high single digits on an annual basis. And if you don\u2019t have rents that are appreciating at a commensurate rate, your returns are going to be challenged, right, unless you have great land basis. We happen to have that in our portfolio across our life science development platform, because we have lots of embedded opportunities in the portfolio. So we have a long runway to go. I describe what\u2019s going on with Platform 16. And our calculus there is that market continues to have some real strength to it. And we probably will see outsize rental rate growth over the next couple of years because of the lack of Class A inventory. And therefore, we will likely with our partners have decision in the next couple of months as to whether or not we want to move forward with that, because it\u2019s not going to deliver until 2025. Those are the kinds of conversations we\u2019re having. I\u2019ll let Hilary describe sort of a timing associated with 343 Madison, because that\u2019s a decision that\u2019s really not in front of us tomorrow. And there\u2019s some work to do with regards to getting the site, quote unquote, enabled to truly commence construction. Hilary? Hilary Spann : Thanks, Doug. I would, first of all echo what Owen\u2019s said about high quality new construction office assets, commanding premiums and rents relative to more commodity. So that\u2019s something that obviously weighs in favor of the potential at 343 Madison, but in terms of our ability to launch construction of the project, we do have some legwork ahead of us in terms of demolition, and in terms of some work that we have to do with the MTA to be ready to proceed. So it\u2019s a decision that we\u2019ll be making in the sort of I\u2019d say near to medium future, but it\u2019s not an immediate decision ahead of us. Douglas Linde : Thanks. Operator : And, sir, we have our next question from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. You may ask your question. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Good morning. Maybe the first question just broadly on San Francisco, it\u2019s been the biggest kind of urban city that\u2019s really struggled to bring people back; and crime and homelessness have really kind of deteriorated the living conditions in the city. So I\u2019m just curious sort of owner, Doug, what your sort of conversations are with the mayor, other business leaders in the city kind of right the ship in San Francisco. And what do you think that timeline looks like for that? Douglas Linde : Good morning, Steve. Look, I think, I would acknowledge what you\u2019re saying. And I\u2019ve said it on previous earnings call San Francisco, the city of San Francisco and up to Silicon Valley has been hit the hardest of all of our markets, because of the pandemic. And I think it\u2019s related to one technology companies being, frankly, behind the other clients that we have in terms of returning people to office. And also I would say, very restrictive COVID regulation, very conservative COVID regulation in San Francisco, occupancy requirements, mask wearing all that kind of thing. So look, I and Bob may want to comment on this, I think there\u2019s an increasing voice in San Francisco that is concerned about the issues that you raised around homelessness and crime and getting the city open. And it is our hope, over time that those voices will be heard, and San Francisco will be able to recover. Again, we look at the whole bay area as the leading computer science knowledge cluster in the world. And we do think that bodes very well for the city of San Francisco, but acknowledge that these factors that you mentioned, do need to be addressed. Bob, is there anything you want to add? Robert Pester : Yeah, the mayor has publicly stated that things have to change. And she\u2019s working on a plan right now to get more policing, and more cops out on the street. So I think you will see a change, Owen and I were on a call with other business leaders in San Francisco yesterday. And there\u2019s clearly an outcry from the business community that things have changed. So I think given some time, you will see a change. And hopefully the DA gets recalled and we get somebody in there that will start enforcing the laws. Owen Thomas : Yeah. I also think, Steve, I would just also add too, I think there\u2019s a circular logic around the crime, homelessness situation and return to office. I mean, obviously, the streets need to be safe for people to return, but the more people that you have on the streets go into the office. I would allow that I think that creates safety, because policing is obviously important. But also protection from each other is also a key to security in city, so both of these things need to happen in tandem. Steve Sakwa : Okay, thanks. Second question, maybe, Doug, you talked about the large pipeline of deals that you\u2019ve got. And I know, it\u2019s hard to maybe just collectively talk about deals or put averages, but when you think about the space needs and how people are planning, and whether they\u2019re downsizing or upsizing. Just what\u2019s sort of the general discussion that you\u2019re seeing kind of with the deals that are sort of in progress today? And what are the changes that sort of expect from a design perspective and kind of space utilization? Douglas Linde : I would say categorically that 80% of the tenants that we are having conversations with today are growing, not shrinking. And I would say that most of those customers are in the finance, asset management, VC, private equity world in both New York, San Francisco and Boston, and then some tangential professional services companies. And I would say the professional services companies are probably the 20% that is probably not growing and would consider some modest reduction in their space. The architectural decisions associated with planning for 2022 and beyond, believe it or not, are very, very consistent with what they were in 2019. The ways people are planning to space are for the most part the same. On the margin, there is no question that architects are talking to their clients about trying to create better and more interesting quote unquote, common areas or community areas or gathering areas or conference rooms, however you want to define it from a client perspective, but the physical space that\u2019s being utilized by these companies that are in our portfolio growing right now, I don\u2019t think you would be able to distinguish much about what is being built in 2022 versus what was built in 2019. And to some degree, it\u2019s a little bit of a surprise. I \u2013 if you go back to listen to my comments in calls, over the last call it 6 to 8 quarters, I think that we\u2019re still not in a position where anybody who is in what I would refer to as a technology or a corporate business understands what the cadence of their team is going to be, as they come back to the office. And it\u2019s very hard, I think, to make monumental changes until you really understand what the impacts of that cadence is, and whether or not it works. I mean, people truly don\u2019t know, I believe how productive and how accepting a quote unquote, hybrid or a partial workday in-person is going to work through lots of industries, until they start to encourage and get their folks back. And we\u2019re not \u2013 we\u2019re unfortunately, we\u2019ve been delayed and delayed and delayed and getting there. So I wouldn\u2019t be surprised for there to be changes in the next cycle, but it\u2019s not there yet. Steve Sakwa : Great. Thanks. That\u2019s it for me. Operator : And speakers, our next question from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question. John Kim : Thank you. Good morning. Owen, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, the widespread corporate dissatisfaction with reduced efficiency and employee retention. I was wondering if you could elaborate on that statement. Is this purely anecdotal? And does that include tech companies who have been really pressing the snooze button on returning to work? Owen Thomas : Yeah, well, I think by definition, it\u2019s anecdotal, although there is surveys that have been done by various service providers and architecture and real estate. But it is from a \u2013 we have 53 million square feet filled with some of the leading companies around the country, and we speak to our clients, and we speak to potential clients as well. And I think we have a good handle on this. And I would just summarize it by saying that I have not spoken yet to a business leader who thinks working fully remote is good for their companies, and they want to make change. I think what\u2019s been making the change more difficult to happen are really 2 things : one, these new variants that keep coming up, so we had Delta at Labor Day, and we\u2019ve had Omicron, over the most recent holiday, and that\u2019s delayed the return to work. And I think the other thing that\u2019s out there is the tight labor market. You watched all the NFL playoff games over the last couple of weekends, I don\u2019t see a lot of MTC theaters in New York are full restaurant reservations are hard to get. People are certainly comfortable doing a lot of things in-person, yet, they\u2019re not coming back to the office. So I do think the tight labor market is impacting business leaders\u2019 willingness to be more aggressive about having their employees come back to work. But I do hear from them concerns about the retention that they\u2019ve had, the difficulty in training new employees, turnover rate for employees that have been hired, post pandemic versus turnover rates that were \u2013 employees that were with the company. Before the pandemic, all these metrics, when CEOs look at them, they have concern. And yes, by the way, on the technology side, we have spoken with many, many corporate leaders at major technology firms. And I would describe that as slightly differently in that they had a remote enabled workforce before the pandemic, because their technology companies and look at the kinds of spaces that they all created with all of the collaboration space, the amenities they provide food service and all those things. That was all going on even before the pandemic. So I think what the pandemic is driving is those kinds of strategies by companies. In other industries, it\u2019s migrating across the industry landscape. Bryan Koop? Bryan Koop : Bryan Koop from Boston. A trend that we\u2019re definitely seeing and it started probably 90 days ago, but is accelerated over the last 30s, every time our team comes back from a tour. There is a noticeable change in who\u2019s on the tour. Tremendous amount of c-suite players, many leadership\u2019s of all departments, et cetera. We\u2019ve done tours with as many as 10 to 15 people highly unusual in the past where the leaders would definitely come in later. They\u2019re coming in much earlier. And they are far more proactive about the design of the space, what the goals are and what their intentions are. And there\u2019s a real realization, we think by these leaders that going to work is no longer an obligation, going to work as a destination. And they want to make sure this is many things at that destination as humanly possible for them. And it\u2019s been really refreshing to see this pro-activity of the leaders and our team has been really having a lot of fun coming back going, you wouldn\u2019t believe who was on this first tour. John Kim : That\u2019s great. Thank you. My second question is a follow-up on the positive commentary you\u2019ve had versus your guidance that you mentioned 180 basis points of embedded occupancy uplift from signed leases not commenced. I think that number increased a little bit from the prior quarter. But you kept your occupancy guidance, basically flat from current levels at the midpoint? Is this purely just due to timing of leases that you plan to sign? Or do you also expect termination \u2013 leases terminated to increase as well? Douglas Linde : It\u2019s actually 100%, John, based upon the timing of when the when the actual rent commencement is going to be. I\u2019ll just sort of give you the kind of example that sort of that we\u2019re working on, and how it sort of manifests, right? So we have a lease expiring at 601 Lexington Avenue in the latter half of 2022. We are already in discussions, lease negotiations like paper is moving back and forth with a tenant on 150 out of 200,000 square feet of space that\u2019s expiring. I don\u2019t know how that is going to shake out as to whether or not we\u2019re going to end up demoing the space and then delivering to them or they\u2019re going to take it assets. The difference between those two things is 18 months potentially of term in terms of when we are able to recognize the revenue. So we have so many of those kinds of quirky transactions, if you will going on that you\u2019re going to hear me talking about, I suspect, as we move into the year, larger and larger amount of space that we have leased, that is where \u2013 that\u2019s signed that\u2019s not yet in occupancy, that number is going to grow, which I think is a great thing, and because that revenue is surely coming in, and it\u2019s very contractual and it\u2019s very long term. But it\u2019s in the short-term, it\u2019s hard for us to sort of gauge, how it\u2019s going to impact our occupancy numbers. John Kim : Great. Thank you. Operator : And speakers, our next question from Jamie Feldman from Bank of America. You may ask your question. Jamie Feldman : Great, thank you, and good morning. I\u2019ll just talk about CapEx and improving assets. How are you thinking about just the cost to run your business and the CapEx load for your business versus history? Is it going to cost a lot more to stay competitive in this new environment? Or the kind of similar to what it\u2019s always been? Michael LaBelle : I think it\u2019s \u2013 for our portfolio is probably similar to what it\u2019s been because we\u2019ve done so much already, right? I mean, I don\u2019t mind doing this, because I think it\u2019s important, when you look at our major CBD assets, which is where the bulk of the cost will be, the new project has occurred, right? So if you go, for example, to market [Arrow Center] [ph], we just \u2013 we spent a lot of money and a lot of time rebuilding all of the lobbies of EC 1, 2, 3 and 4. If you go to 100 Federal Street, you see that we rebuilt and created this really unusual place at the base of the building. If you go to New York City, and you look at what we did at 601 Lexington Avenue with the hue and the redo of the lobby that was done at 399 with a facade and the changes that were made to 599, we\u2019ve been doing this work on a consistent basis. So I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see a major change in the way we are continuing to want to do that to all of our buildings on a consistent basis. And so I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see a quote unquote, big spike in CapEx, but I do think it\u2019s going to be consistent. And we think of it that way, you have to be refreshing your buildings, and thinking about how you can maintain and upgrade your mechanical systems, your destination, which is your elevator systems, your lobby entrances, the amenities in the buildings. We\u2019ve talked earlier, I think, in past calls about, what we\u2019re doing at the General Motors Building, right, where we\u2019ve got a major amenity center that we\u2019ve been working on for three years, and it\u2019s going to hopefully be opening up at the end of this year. And it\u2019s going to be from our perspective, a real change for what those tenants have literally in their building for both health and fitness and conferencing, as well as food and beverage. So it\u2019s like we\u2019re just doing that all the time everywhere. And I don\u2019t think you should anticipate that it\u2019s going to stop, but I don\u2019t think you should anticipate that\u2019s going to somehow increase. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And in terms of your comments about people wanting more common space, you think that affects just the TI load or not necessarily? Michael LaBelle : Well, I can tell you TI \u2013 there are 2 reasons TIs are going up across the board. The first is, it\u2019s a more competitive market, right? There is more available space and therefore economics are more competitive. And, two, it\u2019s a lot more expensive to build out space today. I mean, the increases that we\u2019re seeing in the escalation on that the TI side for any kind of installation are very significant. And so, our contribution to that is not even making up for what the tenant is ultimately going to be putting in their space. So it\u2019s all sort of part of the same challenge, which is the issues associated with the supply chain, and the amount of people who are working across all kinds of industries and all kinds of trades and labor. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then I appreciate your comments, it sounds like you generally think there\u2019s more, at least flat or maybe even expansion on the leasing you\u2019re seeing. What our tenant saying about the hoteling decision? Do you think that that decision has been made for a lot of people already? Or do you think that\u2019s something that they\u2019re going to figure out as time goes on, just in terms of the people sign up for spaces needed? Or do they have dedicated spaces? Douglas Linde : So I think that there are companies who are predicting that they will have space that is not necessarily available to every person every day, meaning there\u2019s going to be have to be some sharing of space, I think that it\u2019s on the margin. But I think it\u2019s absolutely happening. And it\u2019s going to be, I think, not for the entire organization, it\u2019s going to be for certain components of it. So let me give you an example. We have a customer who\u2019s in the asset management business, and I think their portfolio managers are going 100% have dedicated offices, I think if they have a group of people who are in the technology side of their business, who don\u2019t necessarily have to be in the mother ship anymore in a CBD location, they may take some suburban space, and those people may not have a physical permanent home as a seat, but they\u2019ll have a place where they can go when they want to go to work, right? You\u2019re going to see those types of decisions that are being made. But we\u2019ve seen very little decision by large companies that are saying, okay, no longer, are we allowing people to have their physical space dedicated to them on a day to day basis. And they\u2019re going to have to sign up on a daily basis that you\u2019re not seeing that with the Google\u2019s or the Facebook\u2019s, or that the large tech companies, we\u2019re seeing those people continue to want their groups together and want their people, again, as Bryan said earlier, be encouraged to come to work. And if you\u2019re being encouraged to come to work, you want to have a physical place where you\u2019re going to be going when you\u2019re there. Jamie Feldman : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question from Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler. You may ask your question. Alexander Goldfarb : Great. Good morning and thank you. So 2 questions. Big picture one, Owen; and then Mike, a guidance question. Owen, I understand the need for companies to get people back to the office, culture perpetuation of the company training and all that stuff. But we\u2019re now going on the third year of this sort of new normal, and absent a weaker economy that suddenly weakens the labor market and gives your managers more leverage. At what point do the tenants suddenly say this new normal is the new normal? And maybe we do need to adjust how we lease space or use space. That part I\u2019m sort of curious, because we\u2019re now on, as I say, year 3 of this sort of new normal? Owen Thomas : Yeah. Good morning, Alex. Yeah, look, I think a lot of our clients are predicting a new normal, and that\u2019s from full time in-person work to more hybrid work. But as we\u2019ve talked about over and over again, we don\u2019t see our clients saying, we don\u2019t need an office anymore. Again, we keep talking about this leasing statistic for the fourth quarter of 1.8 million square feet. Its pre-pandemic levels for us if people weren\u2019t going to use their offices, why are they making these lease commitments. So we see employers bringing their employees back to the office. And again, as I mentioned, I think there\u2019s an either way, I think, with many workers today, there\u2019s pandemic fatigue. I don\u2019t think this is true across the board, it\u2019s very anecdotal. But you hear that more and more of employees wanting to come back, for the camaraderie for the learning, the training that goes on in the office. So I do think this will change, I look we need this Omicron variant to cool off. We need some of these health security issues to get back into a position closer to where they were last fall when we started to see some very serious increases in our census and we think that will be going on as the winter and spring progress in 2022. Alexander Goldfarb : Well, I mean, there\u2019s definitely mask and COVID fatigue. That\u2019s for sure. Mike on the guidance front. It\u2019s a 3-parter, so to channel [John Guinee] [ph] on a 3-parter. So first is what degree of dispositions are in the guidance and if you guys do the elevated dispositions without impact guidance? The next is, you mentioned $11 million of missing parking is that quarterly or annual? And then finally, on the third quarter call, you mentioned $52 million to go on the COVID recovery? So just curious how much of that is in your 2022 guidance? Michael LaBelle : So there\u2019s no dispositions in the guidance. We never kind of guide to dispositions, because we don\u2019t know when they\u2019re going to happen, not necessarily similar to acquisitions. We just don\u2019t put it in, and in our press release, we indicate that that is the case. With respect to the parking, it\u2019s $20 million and $0.11 that we\u2019re still short and we\u2019ve been kind of seeing an improvement of couple of million dollars a quarter, I would say, between $2 million and $3 million a quarter? I think in the first quarter, we may take a little bit of a step back. Because in January, there\u2019s been a little bit of a step back and Doug talked about that. But, our expectation is that later in the first quarter, we\u2019re going to see that start to improve again. So I think that, we will get some out of that, certainly not the entire $20 million, yeah. Alexander Goldfarb : And then what about the $52 million of total of COVID recovery that you mentioned on the third quarter call? Michael LaBelle : I think that we\u2019re about at $45 million right now. We\u2019ve got, again, parking is $20 million. Hotel is \u2013 if you look at the fourth quarter hotel, we earned about $1 million. So that\u2019s $4 million annually, it should be $15 million, so that\u2019s $11 million. And then the retail is the rest of that, so it\u2019s about $14 million. And I think from the retail, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s that much in 2022. I think we got some big retail that we\u2019re working on where we\u2019re signing leases where the income is going to come in 2023. So I would expect that we won\u2019t get much of that in our guidance in 2022, but it\u2019ll come in 2023. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay, so basically, you\u2019re at $45 million to go now. Michael LaBelle : Yeah. Alexander Goldfarb : Great. Awesome. Thank you. Michael LaBelle : Yeah. Operator : And, sir, we have a question from Rich Anderson from SMBC. You may ask your question. Richard Anderson : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So a lot of talk about what\u2019s the future for office and we don\u2019t know, hybrid, so on. But, let\u2019s say, you get some clarity about where offices going at some point in the future. Can you see Boston Properties making some strategic shifts in how you go about things? In other words, maybe you entered Seattle, maybe you think about a Sunbelt market like some of your multifamily brethren have been doing? Or perhaps is the belief in hybrid long term, that you do more in a way of close in residential to sort of capture that angle of the business? Just any comments on that would be helpful. Thanks. Douglas Linde : Yeah, we have a well thought through perimeter of our business, which is the gateway market, so the country and we did it enter Seattle, because we felt it was in that category. And in our strategy, we have businesses that we think have strong growth potential Seattle\u2019s one, LA\u2019s another, life sciences another, we also have a multifamily business. That has been growing slowly, primarily off sites that we have under our control. So we would certainly be interested in additional multifamily. But we\u2019re going to be devoting our investment capital to building out in the perimeter that we currently have. And we have a wealth of opportunities of sight in our core markets and in some of these growth areas that I\u2019ve described. Richard Anderson : Okay, fair enough. And then just a quick one, when you look at the entirety of the portfolio, what do you estimate the mark to market to be today? And perhaps a comment on market rent growth kind of aggregating up all the observations that were made today? Owen Thomas : I\u2019ll let my financial folks tell me what they think the current mark to market is, I mean, it\u2019s a mathematical exercise that we do every quarter, I don\u2019t know what the results are. Michael LaBelle : It\u2019s somewhere around 5% in the overall market. Owen Thomas : But we are not projecting growth in rents across any of our markets other than in the life science business in calendar year 2022. We think that that there is enough supply on the market that there\u2019s going to be continued pressure. And that doesn\u2019t mean rents aren\u2019t going down, and concessions probably aren\u2019t going up much more than they currently have gone up? We\u2019ve talked about this before. I mean, there\u2019s \u2013 let\u2019s use New York City as the poster child example. I think everybody knows where you can cut a 10 or a 15 year deal relative to concessions in a high quality building in midtown Manhattan. And that\u2019s where the deals are getting cut, and the rents are, what the rents are. We\u2019ve talked about before, when the overall vacancy gets to a point where there feels like there\u2019s a tightness in the market, then rents will start to raise rise that we\u2019re not there yet. So I think we\u2019re being honest about our expectations, again, for our portfolio the bulk of our availability is in the suburban Boston market, where we\u2019re transferring, what were office building rents into lab rents and getting tremendous embedded growth. Obviously, we\u2019re putting capital into those buildings. And we continue to have lots of embedded growth in California, in our CBD portfolio there as well. And we\u2019re seeing it also in our portfolio in the Downtown Boston Market at buildings like the Prudential Center, and 111 Huntington Avenue, and 200 Clarendon Street. So we\u2019re feeling good about the short term prospects for continued, relatively speaking mark to market upsides. But we\u2019re not anticipating a strong recovery in overall market rents in the next year to sort of drive that any further. Richard Anderson : Okay. Good enough. Thanks very much. Operator : And our next question from Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Caitlin Burrows : Hi, good morning, maybe just a question on value added development, wondering how big of a value add opportunity just like the quality and the obsolescence that creates in the lower quality and of the broader office market represent for BXP opportunities like 360 Park Avenue stuff? And then how do you balance that opportunity with the risk that comes with having to re-tenant the buildings making it maybe more like effective development project? Owen Thomas : Yeah, Caitlin, I think the answer to that is case by case. We have all of our regions are tasked with trying to find opportunities like 360 Park Avenue South and we pursue most of the deals that we think. At the end of the day that we can create one of those top 20% buildings that don\u2019t described earlier. And if sometimes those deals we\u2019re disciplined about how we invest our capital and our return requirements. And sometimes all the stars align, and we get deals done like 360 and sometimes they don\u2019t. So we\u2019re going to continue to chase them. And, as I said in my remarks, I have every anticipation that we\u2019ll do some more deals this year. Douglas Linde : I do think some of the opportunities are not necessarily going to be empty buildings. The 360 was a little unique from that perspective, and it creates a great opportunity for us to have a blank slate to rebuild this thing, right? But Safeco Plaza was another one that is value-add and it\u2019s 90% leased. And the opportunity there is really to improve the asset enrolled the rents over time. So, we have very, very interesting opportunities that we underwrite, and look at and try to figure out a way that we can invest capital and generate, again, as Owen said, the discipline return that we\u2019re looking for. Caitlin Burrows : Got it. And then maybe just one on same store occupancy following up on some of the past questions, I know you and peers continue to give encouraging details and all the leasing progress. But so far the same store or same property occupancy is down, suggesting so far that move outs are happening at a faster rate. So just wondering if you could give some further detail on the same store, what has driven that, I guess, offset of leasing progress, and how you do expect it to change? Douglas Linde : So my view on this is, during 2020, we\u2019re in the middle of a pandemic, and leasing velocity and activity slowed down. And so we did have leases that were expiring during that time. And we had tenants in that portfolio that had already made a decision that they were going to move somewhere else, right? So those tenants moved out and the velocity during 2020 was not there to replace those tenants at that time. So you started to see our same store occupancy slip a little bit, right? And what we\u2019re seeing now is an acceleration of leasing velocity. And what Doug went through was a description that based upon what we have expiring over the next couple of years, the velocity we\u2019re seeing is going to be higher than what is expiring. So our expectation is that we\u2019re going to start to increase the same store occupancy as we complete those leases. So it\u2019s really about the leasing velocity, and the fact that our kind of cycle from signing a lease to getting occupancy could be 6 to 18 months, right? So the stuff that the slower velocity in 2020 shows up in our occupancy in 2021 and the acceleration that we\u2019re seeing in 2021 is going to show up in our occupancy in 2022 and 2023, in my view. Caitlin Burrows : All right. Thank you. Operator : And our next question from Vikram Malhotra from Mizuho. You may ask your question. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks so much. Just maybe two bigger picture questions. A lot of my other questions have been answered. In the past, you\u2019ve commented that San Francisco is more cyclical on the upswing and downswing new and spirit to still recover faster than say, New York, is that still the case, given sort of what you hearing and seeing in both markets? Douglas Linde : I think the distinction I would make is San Francisco clearly has the potential to increase much more rapidly. I mean, just to sort of ground everybody 40% plus of the embedded occupancy in CBD San Francisco are technology companies. If someone were to put a chart up that showed, utilization of space and the NASDAQ composite, there\u2019s a pretty there had been historically a pretty strong correlation, it got decoupled in 2020 with the pandemic. And so, as I said, the technology companies have largely been absent from policing markets in greater San Francisco for the past 2 years. And I can\u2019t tell you what the potential demand is from those sectors, but it typically can be very significant. And it can be dramatic in very short periods of time. So I would tell you that I think San Francisco\u2019s volatility, clearly could have dramatic positive going forward in 2023, 2024, or whatever you think the right timeframe is. New York City has a growing technology base, but it\u2019s primarily still a financial services, professional services, led demand base. And so it\u2019s going to have a more granular recovery relative to San Francisco. So that\u2019s sort of how we think about both those markets. Vikram Malhotra : Okay, thanks. And then where does flex by BXP go from here? Is it going to be a much bigger piece of the equation? Are you putting more capital? Would you look to maybe have partnerships with other flex providers down the road just in this new environment of tenants? In most standards, still going back to signing long term leases, like you signed? But maybe there\u2019s some need for more flex? Can you give us your thoughts on how flex changes from here on? Owen Thomas : Yeah, so Vikram, as we\u2019ve said before, we believe in flexible workspace, we think that\u2019s a market that was created pre-pandemic, and it\u2019s here to stay for small companies and also larger users, I think, it\u2019s going to be something like a single-digit percentage of the market, but an important product. What needs to happen is that the flex space that\u2019s out there needs to refill both our own flex space, as well as the flexible space that\u2019s been provided by the other operators. Given the pandemic, the occupancy of many flexible office offerings went down, because tenants are less likely to pay rent if they don\u2019t have to. So that occurred, I think, what\u2019s going to happen is it\u2019s going to refill, right now, we\u2019re not investing additional capital in flex by BXP. But that\u2019s our decision today. We\u2019re going to see how this market shakes out and revisit that decision in future quarters as the flexible office space market recovers. Michael LaBelle : And I just make one last comment, which is most of the flexible space operators have, I would say, transitioned their philosophy from we\u2019re going to take a lease and we\u2019re going to put money in and then we\u2019re going to lease that space someone else to, hey, Mr. landlord or Mrs. landlord, we\u2019d like you to put all the capital in and we\u2019d love to become your management partner, AKA, the hotel chains, right? And so I find it hard to think there are going to be a lot of landlords who are going to be prepared to enter into a new arrangement. Now, there are obviously a lot of orphaned flexible space spaces in all of our markets that have been basically let go by the original landlord \u2013 the real original tenants, and are now in the hands of landlords. And so in many cases where that has occurred, those landlords may say, well, I\u2019d rather not operate this myself. So I\u2019m going to let you know company X Y and Z become my manager for this. And I think you\u2019re going to see that happen before you\u2019re going to see new installations being can tribute it to the market with landlords who are prepared to basically do management deals. Vikram Malhotra : Great. Thanks so much. Just to clarify, Mike, the comment you made the 5% is that a cash mark to market? Michael LaBelle : That\u2019s the mark to market if you took the whole portfolio, and what the rents were getting today, and said, we think the market rent today for every single one of these buildings is, what we have today plus approximately 5%. That\u2019s what that is. And it excludes all the vacant spaces, only spaces currently leased. Vikram Malhotra : Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : And our next question from Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. Ronald Kamdem : Great. Just 2 quick one from me. Just scrolling back to DC, I think last quarter you talked about some of the concession trends there. Any update, any color, what you\u2019re seeing in the market and how that\u2019s trending? Douglas Linde : Well, I\u2019d like to tell you, there\u2019s been a total recovery, and concessions are back to 2013 levels, but Jake, I think this one for you. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right answer, right? Jake Stroman : Yeah, that\u2019s correct. Yeah, I would say that the concessions continue to remain escalated. What we are seeing, though, is that the actual lease terms are extending. So, we rode the wave, sort of north of $300 a foot in concessions, but a lot of times those lease terms are in excess of 15 years. Douglas Linde : And just to put some clarity, Jake is referring to both the 10 improvement in the free rent, right? So there\u2019s a lot of that concessions not in cash it\u2019s in downtime associated with when the commencement we would be beginning for our new lease. Ronald Kamdem : Great. The second question, just one on clarifying for the 1Q guidance, I think you\u2019d mentioned that there\u2019s a seasonal drop. So if I think about the feedback out the sort of for 4Q 2021, you do 181 if you back out sort of the debt extinguishment. So from the 181 to 173, was there anything else that\u2019s baked in there other than sort of the G&A and the hotel that you called out? Or was that all of it? Just want to make sure I got that, right? Michael LaBelle : I think that the G&A in the hotel will be between $0.08 and $0.10 of it, and then there\u2019s some growth in the portfolio. That would offset it. Ronald Kamdem : Got it. Michael LaBelle : The negatives on the G&A and the hotel are greater, right, than the difference between I think the $1.80 and the $1.73 at the midpoint. So there are some positive things from the portfolio interest expenses a little bit lower too. Ronald Kamdem : Yeah. Makes sense. Thanks. That\u2019s all my questions. Operator : And our next question from Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question. Derek Johnston : Hi, everyone. Thank you. So, hey, so we\u2019re intrigued by the 360 Park Avenue South acquisition than JV. Can you discuss the strategic thoughts to expand in this New York City submarket? And, really, secondly, how the repositioning of the asset, the design or amenities has evolved versus maybe the more legacy or pre-pandemic projects? Owen Thomas : So I\u2019m going to allow, Hilary to talk about our plans for 360 Park Avenue South. But you want to just make a comment on our interest in expanding that marketplace? Douglas Linde : Yeah, in New York, we all talk about New York as a market. Well, it\u2019s 3 times bigger than all the other cities that we operate in. It\u2019s got 300 million square feet, and it\u2019s a number of markets in and of itself. So I\u2019ve said on prior calls going into Midtown South is like entering a new market for Boston Properties based on its scale relative and New York scale relative to all the other cities. Midtown South has been a very attractive market to technology and to a lesser extent life science companies, and the primary growth in the office business since the GFC has been in those 2 sectors, and we think that\u2019s an important District of New York, important submarket of New York to participate in and we were delighted to be able to complete the 360 deal in December. Hilary, do you want to talk about some of our plans for the building? Hilary Spann : Sure. So we will be undertaking a complete repositioning of the asset both in terms of the building systems and in terms of the common areas and the tenant places and that will be designed as Owen said, to attract that that tech tendency and media tendency that prefer to be located in Midtown South, we\u2019re already seeing interest from tenants in the marketplace for the space. And so, the building when we\u2019re finished with it will be for all intents and purposes, a new building in terms of the systems and the finishes. And so I think, from that perspective, it\u2019s entirely consistent with what Boston Properties owns in the rest of New York and across the country. So the distinction here is just the submarket and the types of tenants that prefer to be offered in that sub-market. Derek Johnston : Okay. Thank you. And the second question, what will it takes to get office utilization back to 60%, 70%? And do you see that happening in 2022? And there really are slim pickings, guys, so please bear with me. So if hybrid is here to stay, and I do agree with you, if I\u2019m allowed to work from home 2 days a week, and I show up to the office 3 days a week, is my office utilization 60% or is it 100%? Based on that agreement with management? Thank you. Douglas Linde : Okay. So I think the answer to your question is more people coming to work will be the thing that drives utilization, I\u2019m being somewhat tongue in cheek, but that\u2019s honestly the answer. The way people define utilization depends upon their technology and the way they think about utilization of space. So the way we think about it is how many seats are there in a particular building, and how many people use those seats on a daily basis, it may very well be that there are more people with card access to use those seats than there are seats. So for example, if you have a floor with 100 seats on it, but you give 125 cards out, you may have 100% utilization of that space, but you\u2019re only going to be using 80% of your employees on a daily basis. So I think the math is going to be somewhat hard to get a feel for until we really understand how individual companies are choosing to use their space. But we could certainly see situations where you have utilization that 60%, because every single person has an assigned seat, and only the days that they\u2019re there are those cards being used. On the other hand, we may see installations where they have over allocated the number of seats, or the number of access cards for the number of seats they have. So they may be full more times than not, and you\u2019ll have a higher number. So it\u2019s going to be very difficult to judge what\u2019s going on until these companies decide what their own philosophy is with the prospective how they\u2019re going to use their space. Owen Thomas : So I would just add, the important point to what Doug said is, what we\u2019re seeing so far with clients that are utilizing hybrid work is they\u2019re saying, look, we\u2019d like you to come in 2, 3, 4 days a week, but you have to be there on a certain day like a Tuesday or a Wednesday, because why do you want people to come in the office, you want them to be with each other and collaborate. And so you want at least a day or two or more for everyone to be in the office. And I think that\u2019s so if you look at our census trends that Doug talked about, it\u2019s always lower on Monday and Friday, then it is in the middle of the week, because of these \u2013 I think because of human preference, but also because of some of the policies that companies and our clients are taking as it relates to hybrid work. Derek Johnston : Thanks, guys. Thank you. Operator : And our next question from Michael Lewis from Truist Securities. You may ask your question. Michael Lewis : Thank you. I almost feel bad asking a question at this point. So I appreciate your time for thoughtfully and turn off the questions. I just I\u2019m going to ask one, it\u2019s something you touched on a little earlier. But, every time I see a headline that a company is pushing back the return to work. I think the implication is that that\u2019s supposed to be concerning. And, at this point, when returned to office gets pushed back, is that simply a timing issue? Or do you think there\u2019s a risk that it\u2019s still causing more tenants to kind of figure things out and potentially cut or leave their office space? So, for example, if companies returned, at Labor Day versus today, with the demands have been stronger longer term, it gets pushed back from today for the summer with demands have been stronger if they came back today. Basically, are we losing demand as the duration wears on longer? Or do you think at this point that\u2019s kind of less relevant? Douglas Linde : So I would tell you that I think it\u2019s less relevant in terms of how employers are thinking about their space. I think it becomes more challenging depending upon the labor movements that are going on with particular companies. So as companies are having a more and more challenging time dealing with their labor is coming from, I think that has a more pressing implication on their utilization of space and where they want their space to be in the short term, then what the date is per se, because people need to fill jobs. And, I mean, there are \u2013 we\u2019re aware of organizations that are saying, okay, we can\u2019t fill the jobs in this particular market, and we have to fill them with a work from home or a remote location, we\u2019ll fill them in that way, right? I mean, so those are the kinds of things that I think are on the margin, and it\u2019s going to impact the amount of space someone takes in the short-term, but not the planning, because the delay in itself is impacting what their business model is. Michael Lewis : That makes sense. Thank you. Operator : And our next question from Anthony Powell from Barclays. You may ask your question. Anthony Powell : Hi, thank you. You talked a lot about how there\u2019s increasing demand for prime office buildings in most your markets. Do you think this could lead to another cycle of new construction of office buildings of that type? Or is that maybe limited, given some of the rent dynamics? And if so, when did that start to come online? Owen Thomas : I think that, as I mentioned in my remarks, given the pandemic, given the uncertainties about office demand that we\u2019ve discussed on this call, I do think it\u2019s slowed down the development pipeline in general. But that being said, I do think there will be demand for new office space in the future particularly as technology and life science companies grow, and new at least today is very attractive to those customers, and I do think there will be development, we\u2019re going to be doing some of it ourselves. But I don\u2019t see it as \u201cdriving a whole wave of new development\u201d. Anthony Powell : Thanks. So maybe just one more on pricing, I think you mentioned that you expect gets rents really go up meaningfully this year given the vacancies. That said we spread them in positive and given the uncertainty, some of them may argue that there should be been more pressure on the rent. So when you negotiate new leases with tenants, do you get tenants trying to take discounts? Or do people kind of accept the market rents and go from there? I\u2019m just curious about the pricing psychology, given all the uncertainty around office right now. Owen Thomas : Well, we\u2019re so good at what we do that once we put a number on the table, they just say yes, every time. Every deal is different. Most of our clients are in the perspective that if they feel like they\u2019re getting a market transaction, they are going to transact at this point. And they understand that depending upon what their choices are, some of our space may be at a premium, or some of it may be at a discount to something else they\u2019re looking at. And they are able to rationalize whatever that premium or discount is. So we have enough transaction volume in our own portfolio, where we can point to look, this is where we are doing deals, this is what the concession packages, this is what the rent is, this is how much available downtime we might be able to give you, this is how much we\u2019re prepared to put into the deal for ancillary costs that there quickly as a meeting of the minds with somebody who\u2019s ready to transact. And again, because there\u2019s been enough transaction volume, you sort of know where the market is, at any one time. I can\u2019t tell you if that\u2019s going to get better or worse in 2022. But it\u2019s sort of how we\u2019re dealing with things today. Thank you. Anthony Powell : All right. Thank you. Operator : And, sir, our last question from Daniel Ismail from Green Street. You ask you question. Daniel Ismail : Great, thank you. Maybe just to go back to the quality theme. How much is tenant mobility increase your quality space within a market? For example, is it your sense that tenants are more likely today to move around the city? Or leave a sub market for a better space? Douglas Linde : I guess, so let\u2019s just use San Francisco as the example right now. I think what you\u2019re seeing is that the market has gotten smaller from a geographic perspective and some of the ancillary areas that were considered to be up and coming and a little bit on the sort of transitional edgy side are less attractive than the very sort of core marketplace. I think a lot of it has to do with the things that Owen described which were access to transportation and access to amenities, obviously in San Francisco things are slow in terms of the amenitization of the streets, but it will come back. So when I think that probably a similar construct in a place like New York, I would tell you that Third Avenue is probably not nearly as interesting as Park Avenue is, in a very hot market, where there\u2019s lots of activity, Third Avenue has a lot more interest. But as again, as the markets get softer, there\u2019s a necessity to sort of go to better buildings and better spaces, and that generally means the core markets, not the peripheral markets. And I don\u2019t know if any of our \u2013 my leasing colleagues would like to comment on that. Ray, Bob, Jake, Hilary? Jake Stroman : Well, I think that clearly is the case in Reston, Doug, we saw our portfolio there materially outperforms both in terms of occupancy deal flow, and especially rental rates, and we\u2019re attracting the tenants may be in an unamenitized suburban campus coming back to the urban core in Reston Town Center. So from our perspective in DC, Reston is really the poster child for that point. Daniel Ismail : Right. Thank you. And then maybe just how does that impact capital deployment in the near term for BXP, say for instance, 3 Hudson versus 343 Madison? Does that make you less concerned? Or to be more interested in either one of those projects or perhaps a rule out any in the near term? Owen Thomas : I think, Danny, to answer that question is it\u2019ll depend on the facts at the time. I mean, 3 Hudson, as we\u2019ve been saying, was going to given the size of that project at 1.8 million square feet, we want to anchor tenant to go forward with that, and we\u2019ll evaluate the economics of that deal at the time. I do think new is of increasing interest all over the country and in New York. So that\u2019ll help on the rents. But as Doug described, costs are up, and then 343, again, it\u2019s brand new building, it\u2019s got direct access into transit. It\u2019s got everything that we\u2019ve been talking about on this call about of quality, but we\u2019re going to have to assess the economics at the time. As Hilary described, we\u2019ve got some demolition and additional approval that we have to put in place there before we can consider going forward. Daniel Ismail : Great, thank you. And just last one for me, Mike, I believe you mentioned 70% utilization in New York. I\u2019m just curious if that was \u2013 if I heard you correctly. And then maybe if you guys can give a utilization rate for the total portfolio. Michael LaBelle : So the New York City in the fall before Omicron, we were in the high-60s, October, November timeframe. Douglas Linde : I mean, it dropped precipitously, we were struggling to get to 25% in any one of our markets in the first, second and third week of January. But it\u2019s started to rebound. I mean, it\u2019s going up relatively slowly. On a sequential basis, the number of card swipes we\u2019re seeing is up probably 10% or 15% each week, but it\u2019s not anywhere close to where it was in October and November. Daniel Ismail : Got it. That makes sense. Thanks, guys. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over back to Owen Thomas for closing comments. Owen Thomas : I think, we\u2019ve said enough, operator. There will be no closing comments. And I thank all of you for your questions and your interest in Boston Properties. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes Boston Properties conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks. Owen Thomas : Thank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover BXP's operating momentum as demonstrated in our first quarter results. Important trends emerging in post-pandemic work and office use, current private equity capital market conditions for office real estate BXP's capital allocation activities, including a significant acquisition we just announced and our prospects for future growth. BXP's financial results for the first quarter reflect the positive impact of U.S. economic growth, the gradual reopening of the major cities where we operate, and increasing needs by our clients for securing high-quality office space. Our FFO per share this quarter was well above both market consensus and the midpoint of our guidance and we increased our forecast for full year 2022. We completed 1.2 million square feet of leasing more than double the space we leased in the first quarter of 2021 and in line with our pre-pandemic leasing activity for the first quarter, and our leasing momentum continues in the second quarter as Doug will cover. This success can be attributed to not only our execution but also the enhanced velocity achieved in the current marketplace for premium quality workspaces, which are the hallmark of BXP's strategy and portfolio. Finally, we just released our 2021 ESG report outlining the actions BXP has and will take to ensure continued leadership in this critical area. Highlights include remaining on track to achieve carbon-neutral operations by 2025, enhanced disclosures regarding Scope 3 emissions and diversity, achieving multiple financings tied to sustainability performance, inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and recognition for our work from many sources. The report is available on our website, and I encourage your review. As the effects of the pandemic are increasingly behind us, there continues to be much speculation about the future of work and its impacts on the use of office space. While many questions remain unanswered, there are a number of trends which are increasingly coming into focus. First, building census figures, roughly 40% to 80% on the peak day of the week in BXP's portfolio depending upon the city, are improving weekly and are at post-pandemic highs, with many large employers, such as Google and Apple just now implementing return-to-work plans. Second, city leaders are responding to the slow return to office as they understand the vibrant business district is critical to their city's economic health and recovery. The mayors of New York and San Francisco have partnered with their respective city's largest employers and encouraging return to work policies to help reinvigorate their business districts and local businesses that have experienced hardship from the delay in return to office. Third, most business leaders see the challenges of an inconsistent return to the office by their employees given the widening gaps their businesses are experiencing in maintaining corporate culture, onboarding and trading employees -- and training employees and talent retention. Employee unwillingness to return to the office today on a consistent basis is primarily due to very tight labor market conditions and employee desire for flexibility. As business conditions become more competitive due to rising interest rates, slowing economic growth and changes in the labor market, business leaders will likely feel increased urgency in bringing their employees together on a much more consistent basis and modify their return to office policies accordingly.  Fourth, return to office does not mean 5 days a week for most employers. Companies are increasingly providing a flexibility benefit allowing employees to work remotely 1 to 2 days or in some cases, more per week. These employees invariably are electing to come in more frequently Tuesday through Thursday and want more physical separation, their own dedicated workspaces and in-office amenities, all of which make it challenging for employers to reduce space, notwithstanding reduced occupancy for part of the week. Many of our clients have also materially grown their headcount due to buoyant economic growth and market conditions during the pandemic increasing their need for seats. And lastly, building and workspace more important in the office business. To help entice workers back to their workplaces, employers are increasingly attracted to buildings that are new or recently renovated, well-amenitized inside and out and proximate to transportation. Aggregate office market statistics that currently show elevated levels of vacancy and weak net absorption do not properly reflect the market dynamics of the premium end of the market where most of our portfolio competes. We recently completed a disaggregated office market study with CBRE Econometric Advisors, analyzing the relative performance of prime office assets as selected by CBRE representing about 17% of total space versus the rest of the market in 5 of our targeted CBDs. The West LA analysis is forthcoming. CBRE found the vacancy rate is more than 5 percentage points lower for prime office assets versus nonprime assets and 10 percentage points lower in San Francisco. In 2021, for those 5 CBDs, net absorption for prime assets was a positive 1.2 million square feet versus a negative 6.6 million square feet for non-prime assets. This dynamic explains BXP's recent success in achieving pre-pandemic levels of leasing despite elevated total market vacancy statistics. Moving to real estate capital markets. Transaction volume for office assets remains vibrant as $25 billion of significant office assets were sold in the first quarter. Though volume was down 40% from the near record fourth quarter 2021, it was up 57% from the first quarter a year ago and above first quarter levels in both 2020 and 2019. Pricing has remained stable for high-quality office buildings and anything life science related, though rising interest rates have impacted leverage buyers, which could pressure volumes and cap rates. In Cambridge, a majority interest in the 100% leased lab building 100 Binney Street sold at an aggregate valuation of over $1 billion. Pricing was $2,350 a square foot and a 3.5% cap rate. The seller was a REIT and the buyer was a JV of institutional real estate investors. In the Culver City submarket of LA, One Culver was recapitalized at a gross valuation of $510 million. This building is 90% leased and pricing was $1,350 a square foot and a 4.5% cap rate. A regional operator sponsored the recap with a global institutional fund manager. In New York City, 450 Park Avenue was sold for $445 million by an institutional operator to a REIT. The building faces near-term lease expirations with pricing at $1,320 a square foot and a sub 4% initial cap rate. In South San Francisco, the 144,000 square foot 5000 Shoreline Court building was sold for $1,140 a foot and will be vacated for lab conversion. The asset, which will require capital to redevelop was purchased by an institutional fund manager from a corporation at a basis that is equivalent to our completed life science developments and higher than our redevelopments in the same market. Now, regarding BXP's capital market activity, we recently committed to purchase Madison Centre, 1 of the highest quality office buildings in the Seattle CBD for $730 million. Recently built in 2017, Madison Centre comprises 760,000 square feet in 37 stories is 93% leased to leading tenants and is lead platinum certified. The building has 1 of the most generous amenity offerings in the Seattle market with 30,000 square feet of fitness conference library living room, boardroom, fast casual food bike storage and roof deck space. Madison Centre is well located 2 blocks from light rail and bus transportation and direct vehicular access to the i5 North and South ramps. Pricing for the investment is $965 a square foot and a 4.3% initial cap rate, stabilizing above 5% with additional leasing. The acquisition is expected to close on May 17 and will initially be funded with a $730 million bridge loan. Our funding plan over the next year is to either enter into a like-kind exchange with other assets we sell or bring in capital partners as we have done with other acquisitions. The acquisition of Madison Centre accomplishes several key strategic goals for BXP. It expands our presence in Seattle, targeting a growing technology market, adds 1 of the newest and most competitive buildings in the Seattle market to our portfolio, consistent with our quality strategy in all the markets where we operate. And it provides the opportunity to reallocate capital on a tax-efficient basis between markets and specific buildings. On dispositions, in the first quarter, we completed the sale of 195 West Street, which is a 64,000 square foot, 100% leased building in Waltham for $38 million which represents pricing of just under $600 a foot and a 4.7% cap rate. We are either in the market or planning additional sales in our Boston and Washington, D.C. markets several of which could be used in a like-kind and a like exchange for Madison Centre -- for the Madison Centre acquisition. If completed, these transactions will efficiently reallocate capital with limited loss in FFO from East Coast properties into a market-leading Seattle asset. We also completed another active quarter recharging our development pipeline. As previously described, we commenced the 390,000 square foot first phase of Platform 16 in San Jose to be delivered in 2025 and the 327,000 square foot conversion of 651 Gateway in South San Francisco from office to lab to be delivered in late 2023. Our share of investment in these 2 projects aggregates $378 million and projected initial cash yields upon stabilization are in excess of 6%. AstraZeneca announced last week, they have signed a lease for 570,000 square feet to consolidate into a major research facility at BXP's 290 Binney Street development in Cambridge. This development could commence in early 2023, but is contingent on several enabling milestones to be completed this year, at which time we will provide more details, including economics on both it and the adjacent 250 Binney Street Lab and 135 Broadway residential projects. After all these movements, our current development pipeline aggregates 4.1 million square feet and $2.9 billion of investment, is 54% pre-leased, is 27% life science related and projected based on lease-up assumptions to add approximately $200 million to our NOI and over the next 5 years at a 7% average cash yield on cost when stabilized. So in summary, we had another active and successful quarter with strong leasing and financial returns and continue to forecast significant growth in our FFO per share this year, driven by strong leasing activity, continued recovery of variable revenue streams, delivery of a well-leased development pipeline completion of new acquisitions, both last year and this year, a rapidly expanding life science portfolio in the nation's hottest life science markets and well-timed refinancing activity in 2021 and lower capital costs. Let me turn the call over to Doug. Douglas Linde : Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. So we're sitting here on May 3, pretty late for us to have a call, but obviously, we had a lot of news to report, and we wanted to make sure our own schedules worked out there. Most employers have begun their journey to discover how they're going to match their human capital with their utilization of physical space. It's clear that the census on public transportation and in our office buildings continues to be below levels in 2019. There are going to be organizations that make few, if any, changes to their space configuration, location or allocation of space per employee those clients will be and are in the market making long-term leasing commitments based on their growth and as Owen said, a lot of companies grew in their lease expiration schedules. There will be businesses that experiment with different models. These companies could sublet space, they could commit to more or less short-term space or they could simply watch how their business responds to their new in-office cadence and do nothing until their lease gets closer to its natural exploration. It's also true that the availability rate of space, defined by third-party brokers that look at the entirety of the market, and as Owen described, there are lots of ways to cut it. But in general, it's -- it still continues to be elevated in our urban markets. But as Owen pointed out, if you start to analyze the activity, the best buildings are getting more than their proportionate share of market demand. Despite these headwinds, on demand and supply the BXP portfolio had its third consecutive sequential strong leasing quarter. Our total activity was again spread amongst Boston, New York, San Francisco and the Metropolitan Washington region. Last quarter, we showed an occupancy gain of 40 basis points, and this quarter, we picked up another 30 basis points. As we sit here today, we have signed leases for our in-service portfolio on vacant space that has yet to commence, so it's not in our occupancy figures of more than 975,000 square feet, which is up from 925,000 square feet last quarter. This will represent an additional 220 basis points of occupancy. We began 2022 with over 1.4 million square feet of leases in negotiation on space in the in-service portfolio. At the end of the first quarter, after completing the 1.2 million square feet I mentioned, we have active lease negotiations underway in the in-service portfolio and about 1.3 million square feet, and we had over 750,000 square feet in our development pipeline. During the month of April, so the last 30 days, we've signed in excess of 1.1 million square feet of space. We are moving quickly and confidently to lease up our portfolio. While our portfolio is comprised of the highest quality buildings in their submarkets, we have another advantage, which is our operational platform. We are in constant contact with our clients as we look for ways to create opportunities in the portfolio for our customers where a leasing transaction may not be readily apparent. Let me illustrate as I begin my regional comments in Boston. Life Science is the clear driver of new demand in the suburban Boston market, but our traditional Route 128 office leasing is also extremely busy. This quarter, we agreed to recapture and release 73,000 square feet at 77 CityPoint. We were aware of a large tech company that was seeking to establish a presence inside of 128 when we were finalizing the recapture and release of 1265 Main Street late last year, this tenant expressed interest, but we were too far along with our transaction to accommodate them. Our tenant at 77 CityPoint had a lease that expires December 31, '24 and had listed its space on the sublet market beginning in 2019, pre-pandemic related. Instead of simply waiting for the lease to expire we negotiated an early termination of recapture and signed a new 7.5-year lease, which also resulted in a [15%] net increase in the rent. Let me give you another example. We have a relationship with Wellington, the prime tenant at Atlantic Wharf. Our team was aware of Wellington's strong desire to improve their carbon footprint in any new real estate commitments. Working in partnership with Wellington as well as the local energy provider Eversource and a solar developer, we were able to find a way to reposition the mechanical systems at our 140 Kendrick Street project and make a net zero commitment. This resulted in a 105,000 square foot lease for space scheduled to expire in November 22. In addition, we signed leases with 2 other tenants for the remaining 80,000 square feet in this project, and leases for that space were also scheduled to expire in November 22, all with rent roll-ups of about 40%. By just looking at the performance of the [XBI] on your stock screen, it's pretty clear that the equity markets have not been kind to public biotech companies. However, there continues to be significant demand for life science tenants in the Boston market. Many of which continue to be funded with private capital and have strong science working in their favor. Over the last 2 weeks, we've signed another 45,000 square feet of leases at 880 Winter Street and are in final lease negotiations on the remaining space. And we signed a 140,000 square foot lease at 180 CityPoint, the new 329,000 square foot building under construction. Steel erection is underway, and we're hoping to deliver that space in the fourth quarter of '23. And obviously, we are excited to have AstraZeneca as a new client in Kendall Center and look forward to getting that building under construction in early '23. Our CBD Boston activity this quarter was primarily small transactions. We completed 7 deals for 47,000 square feet. Average markup was 17% on a cash basis. At the moment, we are in lease negotiations on more than 300,000 square feet of leases in the CBD of Boston with 4 transactions over 40,000 square feet. The New York regional second-generation statistics this quarter merits some explanation. In early 2020, Perella Weinberg made the decision to relocate out of the GM building. COVID hit, they paused their plans to move and they asked for a short-term renewal. We accommodated that request at an as-is market rent that was below their expiring rent with the hope that we could use this time to convince them to reconsider their decision and entertain a long-term renewal at the GM. What you see in our statistics this quarter is the impact of that short-term deal. Fast forward to April 1, 2022, our operating team was able to work with PWP to provide a long-term solution and they have signed 125,000 square foot lease renewal at GM that will keep them as our client until 2040. The mark-to-market on this new lease involved the relocation to lower [contiguous] floors. On the floors there, that the remaining part of the premises, the rents are down about 7%. In New York City during the quarter, the most significant leasing transaction was a 330,000 square foot extension and expansion at 601 Lexington Avenue. This lease involved the client expanding into a direct vacant floor as well as floors that are expiring in the second half of '22 totaling 180,000 square feet. The rent on this block is down about 7.5%. And we also completed a 70,000 square foot renewal at 510 Madison, where the cash rent is down about 10% and 5 small transactions totaling 24,000 square feet. Our current activity in New York continues to be strong. We have multi-floor lease negotiations underway at 399 Park Avenue at Dock 72 and another full floor lease at the General Motors building as well as a number of smaller leases at 250 West 55th, Times Square Tower and 510 Madison. Total activity is in excess of 400,000 square feet. Construction is underway at 360 Park Avenue South, and we are actively touring the building every week and trading proposals for 2023 lease commencements. Our Boston CBD, Cambridge and Waltham markets as well as Midtown New York are significantly busier than San Francisco, Northern Virginia, D.C. and L.A. In the San Francisco CBD, there have been a handful of large tech tenants in the market, and those deals have gravitated towards the well-built sublease space at assets like 350 Mission and 680 Folsom, our property with a Macy's sublet. The bulk of the activity on a direct basis has been in the financial district, and it continues to be concentrated at the better buildings with professional service firms and financial firms. We completed 10 leases totaling 104,000 square feet in the CBD this quarter, our cash rents increased by 25%. As we sit here this morning, we're working on another 110,000 square feet, including 3 full floors in Embarcadero Center. And we completed over 50,000 square feet in our Mountain View portfolio on currently vacant space. Our venture with ARE, as Owen said, has commenced construction at 651 Gateway, and we are making full floor and multi-floor proposals with anticipated occupancy in late '23, early '24. The venture did about 45,000 square feet of non-lab leasing at 601 and 611 Gateway this quarter. I'll finish my remarks with -- around Northern Virginia and D.C. During the first quarter, activity in Reston was concentrated on partial floor deals, i.e., small deals. We completed 6 totaling 20,000 square feet and are actively negotiating another 5 in the in-service portfolio. We have 1 full floor lease negotiation at their next phase of the Reston Town Center project, but large tenant activity in the Reston submarket has been slow as we started 2022. Rents have held up. They're in the low 50s with a 2.5% annual bump to the low 60s with similar bumps for RTC Next. In the district, we signed our second non-anchored deal at 2100 Penn and are in lease discussions now with a multi-floor office tenant and a retail tenant that would bring the leasing at 2100 Penn to over 80%. Activity at the Street plain, retail in Boston and in Reston in New York City has picked up significantly. Parking revenue in Boston and San Francisco continued to improve, while activity in parking in D.C., L.A. and Seattle is still restrained. The first quarter parking revenue, excluding Seattle, was 77% of it was 2019 and we expect a meaningful bump in the second quarter as we moved away from Omicron. We have had 3 consecutive strong quarters of office leasing and a great April 2022. Employers continue to search for new employees Businesses are leasing space, and we are capturing incremental portfolio occupancy. To circle back to Owen's comments about quality, employers want to use their physical space to encourage their teams to be together. The availability rate in the best buildings is lower, and there is significant relative rental rate outperformance. We create great places in spaces, so our customers can use space as a tool to attract and retain their talent. While not at 2019 levels, employees are spending more and more time in the office and is even more critical to have the right place and space. Mike? Michael LaBelle : Great. Thank you, Doug. Good morning, everybody. This morning, I plan to cover the details of our first quarter performance, the impact of our current and projected capital markets activity and the changes to our 2022 earnings guidance. Overall, as Owen and Doug described, we had a strong quarter. We increased our occupancy, and we continue to grow our revenues. Our share of revenues this quarter is up 4% sequentially from the fourth quarter and up 8% over the first quarter of 2021. We reported funds from operation of $1.82 per share that exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.09 per share. The most -- the improvement mostly came from a combination of higher rental revenues and some lower operating expenses that aggregated to $0.08 per share. $0.03 per share of the revenue outperformance came primarily from recognizing revenue earlier than anticipated due to our clients completing build-outs and occupying their space faster than we expected. For example, at our Reston Next development, we delivered a tranche of 11 floors to Fannie Mae almost a month earlier than we projected, resulting in higher-than-expected revenue in the quarter. We also recognized $0.01 of revenue from restoring the accrued rent balances from clients that struggled during the pandemic, but have now recovered. We had previously reclassified these clients, which are primarily retailers and restaurants to cash basis accounting, and now their sales performance demonstrates the ability to pay their rent over the full term. On the operating expense side, lower-than-anticipated expenses contributed $0.04 per share to exceeding our FFO guidance. A portion of this was from lower-than-anticipated physical occupancy in January and February during the height of the Omicron variant. This resulted in lower cleaning and utilities expense during the quarter. We have seen our physical occupancy rebound and surpass prior post-pandemic eyes, so we expect our expenses to normalize back to our budget for the rest of the year. We also incurred lower-than-anticipated repair and maintenance expenses this quarter, some of which will be deferred to later in the year. The remaining $0.01 of increase in our FFO was due to lower-than-expected G&A expense in the quarter. Now I would like to turn to our 2022 earnings guidance, including the financial impact of our projected capital markets activities that Owen described. We've increased our guidance range for 2022 FFO to $7.40 to $7.50 per share. This equates to an increase of about $0.07 per share at the midpoint from our guidance last quarter. Our portfolio is exceeding prior expectations, and it is projected to contribute $0.11 per share to that increase in our guidance at the midpoint. The portfolio's stronger growth is partially offset by the loss of FFO from our assumptions for asset sales, net of acquisitions and the impact of our anticipated financing activities. As Owen described, we've entered into an agreement to buy Madison Centre in Seattle for $730 million we expect to close before the end of the month. Our objective is to fund the acquisition through the proceeds from asset sales and our assumptions include asset sales of between $700 million and $900 million for the year. Including the impact of this elevated asset sales program, we expect the transaction to be neutral to $0.02 per share dilutive to our 2022 FFO. The range is really reliant on the ultimate size and timing of our sales activity. Looking forward, we expect Madison Centre to demonstrate consistent cash flow growth as we lease up the currently vacant space and roll below-market rents to market as leases expire, -- the positive mark-to-market on current leases is between 10% and 15%. So the initial GAAP return, which fair values the rents is about 50 basis points higher than the cash return that Owen quoted. In addition, the property is new and a very high quality and will require minimal capital improvements. In the interim and in advance of completing our asset sales strategy, we expect to close on a short-term $730 million bridge loan to fund the acquisition. We are also planning to secure long-term fixed rate financing on our recently completed Hub on Causeway mixed-use development in Boston. We're in the market and close to finalizing terms for the residential component and expect to pursue financing for the office and retail component later this year. The impact of these financings is included in our guidance and is expected to increase our interest expense for 2022 by $6 million to $9 million, a portion of which will run through our income from joint venture line. We are seeing improvement in NOI in both our same property portfolio and our development portfolio. In the same-property portfolio, we achieved faster lease-up from delivering spaces to clients earlier than expected. You saw this in our higher occupancy we reported in the quarter. And as a result, we have increased our assumption for same-property NOI growth by 75 basis points to 2.75% to 3.75% over 2021. On a cash basis, we continue to anticipate same-property NOI same-property cash NOI growth of 5% to 6% over 2021. Our non-same properties, which is primarily our recently delivered and active developments, are also exceeding our prior projections in achieving faster absorption. Our share of NOI from the non-same properties, and that excludes the Madison Centre acquisition, is expected to be $75 million to $85 million, an increase of $5 million at the midpoint from our assumption last quarter. The only other meaningful change to our guidance is an increase in our assumption of development and management fee revenue to $26 million to $33 million, which is an increase of $2 million. The improvement primarily relates to higher construction management fees related to tenant build-out activity. So in summary, we have increased our guidance range for 2022 FFO by approximately $0.07 per share at the midpoint. The drivers of the increase are $0.08 of improvement in the same property NOI performance, $0.03 from our developments and $0.01 of higher fee income, offset by dilution of $0.04 of higher interest expense and $0.01 from our net acquisition and disposition activity. Overall, we anticipate strong growth with 14% projected 2022 FFO growth over 2021 at the midpoint. We've improved our occupancy for 2 consecutive quarters, and Doug described both the meaningful backlog of nearly 1 million square feet of signed leases that will come into the portfolio in the next year and our current activity. We have additional future growth from the delivery of our $2.9 billion active development pipeline. It\u2019s currently 54% pre-leased and will deliver over the next few years, plus we're making progress towards adding to the pipeline in the future. Operator, that completes our formal remarks. You can open the line for questions, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Doug, you mentioned in your prepared remarks some large renewals you had at GM and 601 Lex, but with some rent roll downs. Can you comment on the impact that inflation has had on the leasing market? Has that basically encourage tenants to commit to longer-term leases at discounted rents? And going forward, are there any -- is there any impact to the annual escalators that you have on inside? Douglas Linde : So thanks for the question, John. So I would say that there's been no real direct impact on inflation. The organizations that we are talking to are steadfast in their desire to have really high quality, great space. And they're obviously looking at the market and depending upon the particular submarket that they're in, they're able to cut whatever deal they can. And in some cases, that means that the rent that they're currently paying is going to be higher than what they're going to -- what they will be paying in the future, which is obviously a good thing for them. Our escalators are really pretty much market condition oriented. So in a market like New York, the increases are generally on a fixed rate basis every 5 years, and there really hasn't been any change and the escalators in our other markets typically are between 2.5%, although mostly around 3%. And again, to be quite frank, there's not enough pricing power in the office markets for us to dictate additional terms. So we're just being competitive with the market conditions that we compete against within each individual submarket. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman from Bank of America. James Feldman : Doug, I thought your comment on the Boston life science market comparing demand there to the biotech index was pretty interesting. When you shift -- when you think about the Bay Area, can you talk about whether it's on the tech side, small and large companies -- small and large tenants, and on the Life Science side, how are you guys thinking about? And what are you seeing in terms of either a pullback in leasing demand because of what's happening in either the public markets or even in the BC market or maybe you're not seeing a pullback at all. It would just be great to get more color on those 2 sectors, specifically. Douglas Linde : Sure. So I'd answer the question in the following way, Jamie, I think that the West Coast, particularly the San Francisco market, is just behind the rest of the country relative to their commitment to push their employees back to work on a more consistent basis. and therefore, understand the cadence of their utilization of space and what their demand is going to be. So in general, it's just slower there. And that I'm describing both the CBD of San Francisco as well as the Silicon Valley and the Greater Bay Area. Right now, most of the demand that we are seeing for our gateway assets are, what I would refer to as VC-backed smaller companies. We are not -- because we -- the nature of what 651 is, it's not really geared towards a large, what you refer to as a bulge bracket life science company that's public in nature competing for that space.  On the tech side, our demand in Mountain View, which is more sort of smaller companies, is consistent. It's not ferocious. We're not seeing companies say we have to make a decision because we have to bring our people back, and we have to have the space, I'd say there's a little bit more caution in their decision-making, but it hasn't really been a change relative to the environment that we saw 3 or 6 months ago, it's just generally slower in the Bay Area than it has been on the East Coast where people have been, I'd say, much more constructive about going back to work on a longer-term basis for a better part of, call it, a year. And even though there was the Omicron blip, things sort of move quickly back to where they were in October of 2021. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler. Alexander Goldfarb : A question on development. You guys have been pretty consistent developing at 7% plus over the years despite rising costs. So my question is, is this just a function of either, one, development rents keeping pace or two, it's the legacy land basis that gives you that advantage? Or is there a risk that we could see yields come down because for BXP, the development is a key driver of FFO. So just trying to see how sustainable this is, given everything that's going on. Douglas Linde : Alex, Yes, I think the -- as I mentioned, the developments that we launched quarter, we're above 6%, not at 7%. So that's -- it's not across the board. We still have some that are above 7%, but there is some pressure, I think, on development yields. I do think that customers have -- the markets where we've been developing have been very strong and rents have been rising. So it has been keeping up. But I agree, over the longer term, if inflation stays at these elevated levels, it will make development more challenging from a yield perspective. And Alex, if you look at where we started and what we're doing right now on our development pipeline, -- we are -- so we have a residential project that we're moving forward with in Reston. And we're moving forward with life science in the greater Boston market and obviously, with our venture with Alexandria and South San Francisco. But you don't see other than our San Jose Platform 16, us announcing major office developments at the moment. And that's largely because the supply of space doesn't allow us to get the rents that are necessary to take care of the rather significant escalation in costs that we're seeing across every single market. I mean we're generally seeing 1 plus or minus percent monthly escalation right now in construction costs. The reserves making some changes.  We do think that there's going to be a meaningful pullback. We do believe that we're going to start to see the pressure on the supply chain in the construction industry start to alleviate. We do believe that the challenges associated with labor are going to alleviate in the trades. So we're optimistic that things will start to come back. But in 2022, where we just started a project we would be assuming a pretty significant amount of escalation in our cost structure going forward. Owen Thomas : One additional advantage we have with our pipeline is that in Boston because it's not just the land basis and cost, it's -- we've got an active carburetor on when we can start and where we can start and what type of product because we've got existing buildings that we can convert to lab like we're doing at 880. But then we also have land at a great cost basis with permits in place. So we think that's going to be a real advantage as things go on, and we'll be able to judge the market better. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith from UBS. Michael Goldsmith : I'm trying to get a better understanding of how you're strategically looking at leasing Are you more focused on getting occupancy back before emphasizing rate? Or anything to be patient on that rate may come back a bit before stepping up? I'm just trying to kind of understand how you're approaching, do you think is it a short, intermediate or long-term approach? Douglas Linde : I would just say, as a general matter, we meet the market and our buildings to be full. Our income is how the company is valued, we want to create income. And if you go back historically, we have never tried to time the market. We take what the market will give us. And as you -- I think you look at our lease expiration schedules, we really try and get ahead of expirations wherever possible. And so we bring down our near-term exposure. And so in a \"challenging market\u201d we don't have that much in the way of expirations that we're dealing with on an annual basis. I mean, Mike, you tell me we're in the sort of 6% to 7% for the next 2 to 3 years. Michael LaBelle : 5% in the next 2 years. Douglas Linde : 5% for the next 2 years. And so -- and then if we can, we will develop when the markets are better -- and there's -- we have less \u201crollover\u201d in our portfolio, but we take what the markets will give us, and we are -- we believe in meeting the market. Obviously, we look for a premium because we have premium projects we have premium assets, and there are occasionally times when we have more than 1 customer looking at a particular piece of space, and we have a little bit of pricing leverage. And obviously, we take advantage of that whenever possible. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson from SMBC. Richard Anderson : So when we think about the long-term viability of the office business, I get the point about flight to quality in your case. But if we were to get back to full -- to pre-pandemic demand for space. Does that just happen kind of broadly or do you as a landlord or the REITs as landlords have to adjust their tenant exposure pie charts. So I'm looking at your slide -- your Page 24, your supplemental and you lay out all the different industries that you have exposure to. Does it require Boston Properties to change this road map for you to get back to sort of full demand whenever that day comes for office space? Or do you think legal services will come all the way back and real estate insurance, whatever the case may be. I'm curious if you -- it requires you to be proactive to get back to that full demand profile. Owen Thomas : I think the demand is going to continue to be driven by the growth of our client segments. So do the -- how many employees does the client have -- and do they need seats for those employees? I think that is a key driver. I went through what I felt were the key trends that are starting to evolve post pandemic and office use flexibility is clearly going to be a bigger thing going forward. But at the end of the day, what drives space demand is that require an office, albeit maybe on a more flexible basis. So since the global financial crisis, that has been primarily technology and life science tenants. That is where the growth has been. And if you look at our -- if you looked at that pie chart for us, 12 or 13 years ago, it would be very different, finance and legal services were a much bigger piece of it, and technology and life science are a smaller piece. So I think that is not going to change. . Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck from Wells Fargo. Blaine Heck : Somewhat related to that last question. Owen, I wanted to touch on some of your initial prepared remarks when you talked about the tight labor market being some of the cause of the delay in the return to office. I think you said as the labor market gets more competitive, it could accelerate the return to office as employers have more negotiating or bargaining power to bring employees back into the office. Just following that line of thinking, do you think that balance of power shifting towards the employer could have an effect on kind of the other part of your commentary in which you said employees want separation and their own dedicated spaces. Is that something you think could also shift as the labor market shifts and employers could require hoteling for some of the employees or other more kind of economically efficient configurations just as they're going to be requiring that return to office? Owen Thomas : I think it's possible. I think it's very client specific. It's very segment-specific. All of our clients face different challenges as it relates to their labor forces, and their workers have different requirements. So I think your theory could be correct, but I didn't quite say it the way you said it, but I do think, as I have said before, I don't think. I have not spoken to a business leader that is -- thinks -- working remotely all the time is great and is good for their businesses. And so I do think as the labor market tightens up, I think you're going to see more businesses have more in-office work policies. Do I think that means that all companies go to 5 days a week? No, I don't. But I do think that policies will continue to evolve and there will be more in-person work as we move forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Caitlin Burrows : Earlier, you mentioned that peak day utilization is at 40% to 80% in the portfolio, which is a big range. So I was just wondering if you could go through the difference maybe in New York City versus San Francisco or any other characteristics that seem to drive 1 building versus another maybe utilization is higher at newer properties or something else? Douglas Linde : So the -- obviously, it's our portfolio, right? So our portfolio is -- has its own unique characteristics relative to who happens to be in a building and where the building is. But in general, what I would say is as follows : On Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, the largest utilization of space is clearly in Manhattan, unquestionably, undeniably. And then second, it would be in the Boston CBD. And in the Boston CBD, interestingly, it's driven by the financial services firms. In Manhattan, it's both financial services and legal. So we -- in certain of our buildings, we have some legal customers who are very, very dogmatic about bringing their people back all the time. It drops off precipitously from those 2 markets when you look at San Francisco and you look at Washington, D.C. today. And so those numbers are much lower on a relative basis. And honestly, we don't have a lot of clarity on what's going on in our suburban properties because the suburban properties don't have turn styles and that those are open building atmospheres. And so yes, we can go out and try and count cars, but I think that's a pretty inefficient way to know what's going on in the building. And so we're just -- we're unable to really articulate what's going on in the suburban assets in a meaningful way because we simply don't have the tracking there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell from Barclays. Anthony Powell : I guess a question comparing Manhattan to San Francisco. You're seeing more activity in Manhattan, but your rents are a bit down there, but they're up in San Francisco. So what's driving that difference? What's your lease mark-to-market in New York versus San Francisco? And how are these rent trends impacting values in both of those cities? Douglas Linde : Okay. I'm going to try and answer part of those questions because you're gaming the system by asking a 3-part question. Sorry about that. That's okay. So remember that when we are comparing our rents on a second-generation basis, what we're looking at is the in-place rent versus the rent that we're now achieving on that space. So it doesn't give you a good sort of indicator on what's going on with market rents at a particular time. What I would tell you is that market rents in Manhattan have been very, very stable for the last year. And if you go back and look at the calls, for example, that we did in late 2020 and early 2021, we said, okay, there's been a rent reset. We believe net effective rents, face rents, concession packages are down 15% to 20%. That is a truism that still holds today. So as we -- when we are doing deals today, depending upon the building, if we have to have a space that was leased at a higher rent, we're just marketing to that current rent. So what's actually going on with market rents really doesn't isn't -- you're not able to decipher that from the statistics I'm giving you. I'm simply giving you a sense of what's going on in our portfolio. So if you're sort of looking at -- so as my revenues roll over, am I going to be up or down, we're trying to give you indications of how you can get to that number. With regards to the portfolio, Mike, you tell me, in general, we still have a positive mark-to-market of a reasonable amount in San Francisco, and we've had sort of a flat to slightly negative mark-to-market in Manhattan for quite some time, largely because of the disparity of where the rents were achieved when those leases are rolling over, over the next 2 or 3 years. Michael LaBelle : Okay. I think that's correct. I think the reasoning is that in San Francisco, you saw a decade of rent inflation going into the pandemic. So our in-place rents were very low. And we've been replacing those with higher rents for the last several years, and we continue to replace those rents with higher rents. So we still have a strong mark-to-market positive in San Francisco over the next couple of years, it should be somewhere around 10% to 15% on the leasing that we expect to do. And I would say that the rents we're getting in San Francisco on the high-quality spaces that we have are stable. I mean we know what the rents are. We're able to get deals done. New York City on the alternative had a lot of development with the Hudson Yards before the pandemic, and it limited the rent growth that the market saw before the pandemic. So we didn't have the same kind of growth over that time frame. So then now we're looking at, as Doug said, rents went down a little bit. So we're looking at roll-downs -- and sometimes they're going to be higher this quarter. Sometimes they're going to be flat. I think overall in New York City, it's probably something around maybe 5% to 10% negative overall, something like that in the portfolio. Douglas Linde : And again, that's why I'm trying to give you on the real deals that we're doing on a quarterly basis. I'm trying to give you the comparison, so you can sort of see what's going on, right? So I said in New York, we've had a couple of large deals that we've done, and it's been down about 7%. And in Boston, in the suburban portfolio, it's up by 40%. And in the CBD, it's been up by 15% to 20%. So we're just -- I'm trying to provide you with as much clarity as we possibly can and sort of what's going on, on a revenue basis as you think about modeling our portfolio going forward. Now Owen, you may want to talk about values relative to New York and San Francisco. Owen Thomas : Values for assets capital markets? Douglas Linde : Yes. Owen Thomas : Well, look, I think as the comparable comp statistics, which I try to give on this call every quarter indicate, I think values are driven primarily by cap rates and the per square foot comes out as a result. And those cap rates, both in New York and in San Francisco, I think for a high-quality office building have been somewhere in the 4s, low or high 4s depending on what the rental structure is in the building. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman from Citi. Emmanuel Korchman : Just hoping to maybe a little bit more details on the asset sales. I think you mentioned they'd be in Boston and D.C. And also just how you're thinking about all-out sales versus JVing those assets? Owen Thomas : Yes. So we will -- we are selling assets this year. Mike mentioned the volume that we currently have in our projections. If we're able to accomplish those sales, we will like kind exchange them into Madison Centre. And it's a very efficient way for us to reallocate capital. We've talked about and are frequently asked about raising capital through asset sales. And as we have described, that is an inefficient way for us to raise capital, because the gain is plus or minus 50% in most of our major assets and that capital would have to be dividended as a special dividend to shareholders, and we would not be able to keep it for corporate purposes. So if we can accomplish this like-kind exchange, then we basically will be reallocating investments that we have in assets in the Washington, D.C. and Boston markets to terrific building that we just bought in Seattle. There is a, we think, a slight FFO reduction associated with this because there could be cap rate differential, timing differentials, things like that. Douglas Linde : And just to further comments, Manny. So first is you can't do a like-kind exchange with a JV unless it's the exact same JV and it's really hard to do that. So effectively, if we're going to sell an asset and do a like-kind exchange, it has to be a wholly owned sale. And two, the reason that we're doing this and not simply doing JVs is because we're trying to maintain balance sheet strength that we currently have, and we're looking at ways to fund our strategic initiatives as Owen described, which was to try and move into Seattle in a way that's leverage neutral. And so we're -- obviously, we're looking at ways where we can raise capital for things that we want to accomplish from a strategic perspective, not just raise capital and then dividend it out to shareholders. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Nicholas Yulico : I just wanted to turn back to the guidance, Mike, and the fact that, I guess, you got even in the first quarter revenue earlier than expected as tenants built out space faster. I mean how should we think about that impact in the guidance, kind of where you are today in terms of budgeting for that? I mean, is there a chance that you're still -- there's still some benefit that still has to come from that process that's not factored into guidance for the year? Michael LaBelle : Look, I mean, it's possible -- we've obviously provided a range, and that range has expectations for when we do believe leases are going to start for leases that we have underway, and it provides some room on either side for that to change. In certain cases, our tenants control the timing because they're doing the build-out. And if we can't recognize revenue until they complete the work, it can be a little bit harder to kind of judge exactly when it's going to happen. And if you have bigger leases starting like, for example, Verizon at the Hub or Fannie Mae at Reston Next, and you got a big chunk of space coming on, it can be meaningful if you missed by a couple of weeks or a month. So I think that's built into our range when we think about our range and what could or could not happen. We build that into the range as we kind of look at the 2.75% to 3.75% same property growth range, and then we provided the range as well on the non-same stuff, which is kind of as the developments start to -- tenants start to commence. But it is -- it's not perfect because obviously, there's challenges out there with supply chain and getting work done on time. And we've been -- and our clients have been pretty effective at getting that stuff done on a timely basis, but we have to kind of think a little bit conservatively about what the boundaries are. And that's what we do when we build our range. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley. Ronald Kamdem : Just sticking with sort of the guidance and specifically on the occupancy guide. Just when I think about where the in-service occupancy is today versus the guidance maybe can you help us sort of bridge maybe the upside and the downside given the amount of leasing that's being done, obviously, I would have thought that would have been more of an occupancy pickup this year? And admittedly, there's a lag between signing and commence. Just trying to get a sense if you could bridge that gap between the occupancy guidance and what you get you to the upside versus downside? Douglas Linde : So let me describe why don't we don't get it immediately, and then I'll let Mike give you sort of the ranges that from an occupancy perspective. So let me give you an example. So at 601 Lexington Avenue, we have a tenant that's going to take space that's currently leased in the -- towards the end of 2022. We are going to demo that space. We're going to deliver that demo space to that customer and then that customer is going to build out that space. That space won't get built out until sometime in the middle to late part of 2023. And even though we have a contractual agreement with that tenant as to when their rent commences, we're not going to be able to start revenue recognition and therefore, add it to our occupancy until that date occurs. So as I said to you earlier in my comments, we have call it 975,000 square feet of leases that have been signed where revenue has yet to commence. Some of that's in '22 and a lot of it's in '23. And so we just -- we continue to have these timing issues associated with when we can recognize occupancy and therefore, show you revenue on a contractual basis, even if we're getting it, right? We have had situations where we're collecting cash rent and we're not able to record it because the tenant is not in occupancy. And that's going to happen, for example, and our building at 325 Main Street. We're going to start collecting rent, and we're not going to necessarily have a TCO because the tenant doesn't have all of their work done, and they're paying us contractual rent, and it's going to go on to our balance sheet, and it's not going to show up in our revenue stream. So these things just sort of happen on a consistent basis with us because of the timing of when we're actually \"delivering space.\" And Mike, you can give the guidance in terms of the range. Michael LaBelle : Yes. I mean, look, there's a lag, as Doug is talking about. When we sign leases and we get occupancy. And during the pandemic, our leasing volumes were lower. So we weren't signing enough leases to replace what was going on, so we lost some occupancy. And for 3 consecutive quarters, our leasing volume has been strong, and Doug just talked about the April leasing volumes, which point to a pretty good second quarter. So that demonstrates that we should be able to gain occupancy. And we only have 2 million square feet rolling, and we're doing over 1 million square feet a quarter, we should be able to gain occupancy, but there is a lag of 6 months to 12 months to get the leases in place. So that's why it's a little bit slower at the beginning to kind of gain it, and I think it will accelerate later on as we do it. I mean, we feel very good about where we stand today. We have 2 million square feet expiring. We've got 975,000 square feet signed that is going to go into place over the next 12 months approximately. And as our expertise, we probably have 0.5 million square feet that we're working on deals as well. So I think we're really well positioned to gain the occupancy. I just think it's going to take a little bit of extra time. I mean, right now, we've -- our guidance, I think, is 88% to 90%. I think that I feel pretty good about that range. It's going to be hard for us to get in excess of 90% this year based upon what we see. And I think that we'll do a good job I think it's going to be hard for us to reach the bottom too, honestly, given where we are today. . Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Amit Nihalani from Mizuho. Unidentified Analyst : Are you starting to see any change in leasing activity from co-working providers across your markets? Owen Thomas : Yes. Well, in terms of the -- they're doing primary leases. I would say that activity is zero. But I think the question you're asking is what's the occupancy of the co-working units themselves? And I think, yes, I think they're going up. We monitor It's hard for us to know exactly. WeWork is public now and they do state these statistics, and I do believe they have been reporting to their shareholders increases in occupancy, which makes sense to us. Our census is going up every week, theirs should as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore. Stephen Sakwa : I guess, Doug, there was really no comments on the L.A. market. I'm just wondering if you could share your thoughts on the leasing the acquisition opportunities and whether you expect to start your 300,000-foot development in the Beach Cities anytime in the near future. Owen Thomas : I'll talk a little bit about capital markets. I'll turn it over to Doug for the leasing. We have a strong interest in growing our L.A. footprint in our selected West L.A. markets. And we're actively reviewing a few things, but we don't see the same level of transaction activity in the L.A. market that we see in our other markets at the current time. But when things are available, we certainly pursue them. Douglas Linde : And just with regards to our leasing activities, Steve, so we have -- we did a lot of leasing in calendar year 2021 in L.A. So our -- we have 1 primary piece of space, which is at Colorado Center. It's the former HBO space on the top 2 floors of 1 of the buildings, and that space is currently being demolish and sort of ready for tenant delivery I would say the activity on it has been light. There's been a decent amount of leasing that's gone on in West L.A. A lot of it has been musical chairs with a bunch of subleases that were available that are no longer available or that have been taken off the market, a decent amount of direct leasing in both Culver City as well as Playa Vista. And so I'd say we're constructive on the West LA market. We just -- we don't have a lot of action on our space at the moment. And in light of that, we just -- we're not able to sort of show you statistically things that are going on in our portfolio because we just don't have much in the way of available space. Owen Thomas : Yes. And then you asked about Beach Cities. We're in the middle of designing that building. It's going to be an extraordinary project. I think it will be, by far and away, the best building in El Segundo. And we are still in that process, and we haven't really decided yet on what basis we'll launch the project, but more to come on that from us in future quarters. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Ismail from Green Street. Daniel Ismail : Owen, you started your comments off with ESG and sustainability. And I'm just curious from what you've observed in the portfolio, how are those green aspects influencing tenant decision-making processes. Are deals being won or lost because of any of those factors? Owen Thomas : Yes, but not universally across the board. Doug described the engagement that we had with our great client Wellington in the suburbs of Boston, where providing them a net 0 fulfillment and also very limited scope 3 emissions relative to new build was critically important to their decision. I noted when AstraZeneca announced they're at least signing with us in Kendall Center. They talked about the sustainability characteristics of our clients, it's absolutely mission-critical, but I would not say that, that exists across the board. I think it's increasing. And I think we're going to see more of it in the years ahead. Koop, anything you want to add to that? Bryan Koop : It's growing, as mentioned by Owen. With a client like Wellington, they entered with us with Boston's first green skyscraper. So as part of client partnership we've grown together and they've become more committed and so have we. But Owen is right, it's several of our top clients are getting more and more passionate about it, and it's bigger criteria, but not across the board entirely, but it is definitely growing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank. Derek Johnston : A lot of good questions have been answered. In your opening remarks, you detailed recovery trends and thoughts were shared in your markets with admittedly some recovering faster than others. But meanwhile, Southeast Florida and Miami seem to be booming. I mean you have net migration, corporate relocations, large-scale job growth. Any interest in serving Southeast Florida with perhaps a small portfolio acquisition followed by your development prowess, really gaining scale and what we see as a strong gateway market? Owen Thomas : We're excited about our gateway perimeter and footprint, and we have gone into several new markets and businesses over the last 3 or 4 years. We went into L.A. 3 or 4 years ago, it remains 1% to 2% of the company. We went into Seattle last year. We now have 2 buildings. It's probably 1% to 2% of the company. There's a life science efforts, we've talked about that currently at 6% to 7% of our revenue. And we've mentioned that we believe we can double that over the next 5 years in the gateway markets where we are. So we have tremendous growth opportunities. As hopefully, we've communicated on this call in the gateway markets where we operate. And at this point, we are not interested in expanding outside of those 6 markets. Operator : There are no more questions at this time. Turning the call back to Mr. Owen Thomas for closing remarks. Owen Thomas : Thank you, everybody, for your interest in Boston Properties. And I hope you enjoyed the 1 question system. I made for a more efficient call. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Presenters, please stay on the line for the post conference.",

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.  I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today to Helen Han. Helen Han : Good morning, and welcome to BXP's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. The press release and supplemental package were distributed last night and furnished on Form 8-K. In the supplemental package, BXP has reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G. If you did not receive a copy, these documents are available in the Investors section of our website at investors.bxp.com. A webcast of this call will be available for 12 months. At this time, we would like to inform you that certain statements made during this conference call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although BXP believes the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its expectations will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements were detailed in yesterday's press release and from time to time in BXP's filings with the SEC. BXP does not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements. I'd like to welcome Owen Thomas, Chief Executive Officer; Doug Linde, President; and Mike LaBelle, Chief Financial Officer. During the Q&A portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, Senior Executive Vice President, and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions. [Operator Instructions]  I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks. Owen Thomas : Thank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover BXP's continued strong performance as demonstrated in our second quarter results, high-level trends in the economy and in-person work affecting BXP, current private equity capital market conditions for office real estate and BXP's capital allocation activities. BXP's financial results for the second quarter reflect the continued positive impact of the post-pandemic reopening of the major cities where we operate and the increasing needs for our clients for securing high-quality office space. Our FFO per share this quarter was well above both market consensus and the midpoint of our guidance, and we increased our forecast for full year 2022. We completed 1.9 million square feet of leasing, more than 160% of our leasing volumes in the first quarter and 140% of longer-term average leasing activity for the second quarter. This success can again be attributed to not only our execution but also the enhanced velocity achieved in the current marketplace for premium quality workspaces, which are the hallmark of BXP's strategy and portfolio. It's clear over the last quarter that economic conditions in the U.S. and globally have deteriorated. The key culprit is inflation, which as it continues to reach new highs, set off a chain reaction of events, starting with : the Federal Reserve taking and signaling severe tightening measures; interest rates rising across the yield curve; volatility and losses in the public equity and debt markets; and now increasing concerns that the U.S. economy may experience a recession. This evolving operating environment is having several impacts to BXP's operating activities. Though our leasing activity has been very strong for the last few quarters, we anticipate headwinds at least in the short term. Business leaders are generally more reticent to make large capital allocation decisions, such as a lease, in an uncertain economic environment. Before the summer season, office usage by our clients continued to gradually increase. There is increasing evidence that many businesses have or will tighten up in-person work policies as economic conditions worsen. Many of these companies also significantly increased their workforce during the pandemic without increasing their available space. These factors should help offset, at least partially, the recessionary headwinds to space demand. Our capital costs have increased, which Mike will cover in greater detail, due to higher interest rates and credit spreads. And private market debt financing, both for construction and existing assets is significantly more challenging to arrange. As discussed in prior quarters, inflation has increased construction costs for new development. Though the cost for our launch development pipeline are essentially already locked in, the cost of potential future developments continues to increase. We are not able to predict the depth or length of the current economic slowdown. As a result, we are positioning BXP for relative success regardless of the economy trajectory by carefully managing leverage while continuing to selectively invest in opportunities with the highest return versus risk characteristics. In terms of real estate capital markets, transaction volume for office assets slowed to $18 billion in the second quarter, down 40% from the first quarter and flat to the second quarter last year. Though volumes are down, liquidity remains for the higher-quality assets that often trade to institutional buyers not requiring leverage. Cap rates have increased at least 10 basis points for the highest-quality assets with limited leasing exposure and more for assets of lower quality and/or with riskier income streams. Availability of financing is a key market driver. There were several transactions of note in the second quarter. In the Seaport District of Boston, a developer recapitalized 451 D Street with a fund manager for $708 million. This 480,000-square-foot building was fully leased and pricing was just under $1,500 a square foot and a 4% cap rate.  In El Segundo, 555 South Aviation Boulevard sold for $206 million to a fund manager. This 260,000-square-foot building is fully leased and was extensively renovated in 2018. Pricing was $790 a square foot and a 5.3% cap rate. And lastly, in Sunnyvale, Moffett Green was sold to a pension fund adviser for $875 million. The 4-building 720,000-square-foot complex is fully leased to Meta and sold for just over $1,200 a square foot and a 4.5% cap rate. Regarding BXP's capital market activity, we closed on our previously described Madison Center acquisition in Seattle for $730 million and continue to selectively pursue acquisitions in our core markets with financial partners. On dispositions, we completed the sale of VA 95, an older 11-building 733,000-square-foot suburban flex office park located in Springfield, Virginia, for $127 million, which represents pricing of $173 a square foot and a 6.2% cap rate. Bought in 1981 and developed by BXP over time, VA 95 was an early and successful investment by BXP that no longer fits well with our corporate strategy. We are making good progress in the sale of several additional assets in the Washington, D.C. market, which we intend to use to fund the Madison Center acquisition through reverse lifetime exchanges. If these transactions are successful and including 2 sales already completed this year, total dispositions for 2022 could exceed $850 million, allowing BXP to both raise incremental liquidity and reallocate capital on a tax-efficient basis from the Washington, D.C. to the Seattle markets. Our development pipeline continues to deliver accretive projects to our in-service portfolio and is consistently recharged with new starts. This quarter, we delivered 325 Main Street in Cambridge, a 414,000-square-foot building in which the office component is 100% leased to Google. Our $418 million investment in the project is estimated to have a first-year cash yield on cost of 8.7%. In Reston, Virginia, we commenced the development of a mixed-use project in Reston Next, comprising a 4-story 90,000-square-foot jewel box office building and a 508-unit highly amenitized residential complex. Most of the residential units will be located in a notable 39-story tower, which will be the tallest building in Reston. BXP will own 100% of the office component and a 20% interest in the residential in partnership with an institutional investor. This project is the next step in the full build-out of our very successful Reston Next development within Reston Town Center. All of these movements with -- after all of these movements, our current development pipeline of 11 office, lab and residential projects as well as View Boston, the observation deck at the Prudential Center aggregates 4.2 million square feet and $2.6 billion of investment that we project, based on delivery date and lease-up assumptions, to add more than $190 million to our NOI over the next 5 years at a 7.5% average cash yield on cost when stabilized. The commercial component of our development pipeline is 49% preleased. So in summary, we had another very successful quarter with above-expectation financial performance, strong leasing success and significant investment and capital reallocation activity.  Let me turn the call over to Doug. Doug Linde : Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. So our last conference call was on May 3. And over the last 86 days, the conversations on the demand side of our business have really shifted from, as Owen described, return to work and space utilization to the pace of job growth and job reductions as the impacts of the Fed's actions moved their way through the economy.  While leasing activity has slowed some across every market, new lease transactions that have been in documentation during the first half of the year across all of our markets and not just with our tenants continue to move towards completion. In our portfolio, none of our active lease negotiations have been scrapped. And I think that's important relative to how we have seen other dramatic slowdowns occur, where people and companies have become much more cautious about what they're doing. There is, however, less urgency with clients to make new commitments. As we consider our expectations for leasing completions in the back half of '22 and '23, we are obviously factoring in the impact of the slowdown in the macroeconomic activity, business performance and reduced overall demand for space. The availability rate defined by third-party brokers that look at the entirety of the markets continues to appear to be very elevated across virtually every office market in the country, and our markets are no exception. Last quarter, we described the work that CBRE Econometric did on the availability in the premier assets in the urban markets. Availability of space is at lower levels among premier buildings. These assets continue to get more than their proportionate share of market demand. And there are still premier building micro markets like the Back Bay in Boston or View Space in Class A buildings in San Francisco that are still performing really well, meaning rents and concessions are equal to, if not better than, pre pandemic. We have moved away from looking at the percentage of card access swipes relative to February of 2020. It seems to be talked about in the Wall Street Journal every day and are now measuring the daily and weekly utilization of seats. We've got pretty good data on daily utilization in our Boston Back Bay and New York City assets where the customer makeup is dominated by traditional financial services and professional services firms, i.e., very few technology companies. Here, we're seeing about 70% of the is being used on a weekly basis with about 50% of the employees using the space 3, 4 or 5 days a week. Now when we compare utilization from 2020 pre pandemic, the striking difference is the daily difference, where we saw 80% of the employees coming in 3 or more days a week in early 2020, 2019. There was a ramp-up, as Owen said, between March and June, but it really has plateaued as we began the summer. Some business leaders, including a few renowned technology CEOs, are becoming sterner in their message to employees regarding the importance of in-person daily activities in traditional office space. This may lead to greater daily utilization as we end the summer holiday season. We'll be able to tell you about that as we look at our September data when we talk to you in October. In the last week, we've seen announcements from some of the tech titans, Amazon, Meta, that acknowledge that they're trying to figure out how they're going to match their human capital with the utilization of physical space. Changes in the labor market supply are also going to impact these decisions. And as I said last quarter, I think this is going to be a journey when any industry expert could tell you they know how business is going to use their space or what they even think remote or hybrid work actually means in 2024 is grossly overestimating their expertise. Getting to our performance. The second quarter was a great leasing quarter for BXP. This is now the fourth straight quarter of strong overall leasing activity in our portfolio. To remind everybody, beginning with the third quarter of '21, we signed 1.4 million, 1.8 million, 1.2 million and this quarter, 1.9 million square feet of leases. So that's 6.3 million square feet of signed leases in the last 12 months. This activity has occurred in the midst of the Delta variant, the Omicron variant, remote work fits and starts and most importantly, significant labor market headwinds. As we speak to you this morning, we have signed leases on more than 975,000 square feet of in-service baked-in space that are not yet in our occupancy figures. About 50% is going to commence in '22 and the remainder in '23. At the end of the second quarter, after completing the 1.9 million square feet of active leasing, we have an additional active lease portfolio in negotiation in the in-service portfolio of 1.3 million square feet. 640,000 square feet would cover currently vacant space, so most will go into service in '23 and the other 660,000 involves currently leased space, so aka renewals or replacement tenants. Known expirations for the remainder of '22 total under 1.7 million square feet. Over the last 4 quarters, our occupancy has improved by 90 basis points and stands at 89.5% as of June 30. We expect to see a slight decline over the next few quarters as we wait for all of these signed leases to commence, but in spite of even our less robust leasing expectations, we should see occupancy pick up slightly in 2023 from today's level. The development portfolio includes 1.1 million square feet of signed leases that have yet to commence, and that excludes the lease of 290 Street. And these buildings are not included in our occupancy figures this quarter. Reston Next will be included in the in-service portfolio of '22 without the 200,000 square feet signed Volkswagen lease that won't commence until '23.  We are going to see an increase in contribution from these assets even though they will show a reduction in our reported in-service occupancy. A good portion of the vacancy in our Boston suburban portfolio is now comprised of space in buildings we have actually vacated as we plan our next group of future life science conversions. When we commence redevelopment, these assets will be taken out of service. So let's talk about sort of my ranking of the markets. It goes into sort of 3 tranches. The Boston CBD stands out as the most active of our portfolio, and it is by itself in the trough tranche. And by CBD, I'm really referring to the Back Bay because that's where we have the majority of our portfolio. The New York City, Reston, Virginia really leases under 25,000 square feet; San Francisco, again, smaller tenants, leases under 25,000 square feet; and Washington, D.C. CBD make up sort of the second tranche. And then suburban Boston, South San Francisco, Mountain View, Princeton and West L.A. make up the third. Activity on the East Coast is stronger than activity on our West Coast portfolio. I think this is a function of the composition of customer demand, which has a much heavier weighting of market occupancy from traditional financial services and professional services firms on the East Coast versus technology and media companies on the West Coast. I think the big changes from the last quarter in our portfolio are the increased level of leases we're actually working on in our D.C. CBD portfolio and then the slowdown we have seen in the Boston suburbs. Now to be fair, we completed over 220,000 square feet of suburban office leasing in the suburban Boston in-service portfolio during the second quarter, where the average market rent on second-generation space was up 34%. In addition, all of the life science leases we were negotiating at 88 Winter Street were executed this quarter.  We signed 3 separate leases totaling 72,000 square feet in that building, and it's now 97% leased with expected occupancy in September for the first tenant. We also signed 2 leases at 180 CityPoint, our next life science delivery totaling 140,000 square feet. So if you include the 570,000 square feet on Binney Street, we actually executed over 775,000 square feet of life science leases during the quarter in our Boston portfolio. 2021 was an extraordinary leasing year for life science, and the slowdown we are now seeing in the office leasing activity is also being felt in the life science market in our suburban Boston, suburban San Francisco and suburban Montgomery County portfolio. The biotech index, IBX, is down significantly from a year ago and fewer private companies are getting funded, which translates into a drop in active requirements relative to last year. I would note that the big pharma companies continue to have an appetite for new space in our markets. Early-stage life science tenants and their investors with an eye to slowing down their capital outflows are also pushing more of the capital spend needed to fit out space to the landlord in the form of higher TI demand. In the Boston CBD, we completed 253,000 square feet of leases. The markup on that portfolio was 18%. More than 450,000 square feet of our leases in negotiation are in the Boston CBD portfolio and that includes 200,000 square feet of retail space that has been vacant. In the San Francisco CBD, there have been a few more large tech tenants that have completed leases in sublease space, but the bulk of the activity on a direct basis has been north of market and it continues to be concentrated in the premier buildings with professional services and financial services firms. This quarter, we did 9 leases totaling 96,000 square feet in the CBD portfolio, and the leases had a second-generation increase of 37%. We also completed 2 transactions in Mountain View with an uptick of only 3%. In other positive news on the West Coast, we completed a 60,000-square-foot lease for the top 3 floors that are vacant at Safeco Plaza in Seattle. When we purchased the asset in '21, our plan included a major repositioning of the public and amenity spaces at the Fourth Avenue and Third Avenue Street plans. We have begun to introduce our repositioning plans for the building. And this, combined with our proven track record in creating great places and spaces, allowed us to win over a current BXP West Coast client to Safeco Plaza. Activity in the D.C. region was pretty light during the second quarter with the 8 office transactions totaling only 43,000 square feet and 8 retail transactions totaling 39,000. But as we look forward, we're negotiating over 270,000 square feet of leases for the in-service portfolio and 95,000 square feet of leases at 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue, our newest development in D.C. In the New York region during the quarter, the most significant transaction was a 125,000-square-foot extension at General Motors building that got signed in early April and I described last quarter. In addition, we completed another 168,000 square foot of leases across the portfolio. There were some ups and downs in the lease-to-lease rent comparison, but together, the portfolio had a slightly positive under 1% mark-to-market on the leases executed during the second quarter. We have multi-floor lease negotiations underway at 399 Park Avenue, 601 Lex, and last week, we signed a 71,000-square-foot 2-floor lease at Dock 72. Total active leases in the New York City portfolio as of July 1 was in excess of 260,000 square feet. We have had 4 consecutive strong quarters of office leasing. We have incremental development deliveries hitting in '22 that will be at their run rate in '23. We still expect occupancy improvement in '23, though at a reduced rate based on the slowdown in the economy. We continue, as Owen said, to feel really good about our portfolio position in each market. And our lack of meaningful lease expirations in '23, just over 2 million square feet, puts us in a great position entering the year. We have a strong balance sheet with low floating rate exposure and near-term maturities, so debt financing costs are going to be higher in '23. In addition to his commentary on the second quarter performance, Mike will discuss our internal interest rate expectations and our financing plans. Mike? Mike LaBelle : Great. Thank you, Doug. Good morning. So as Doug said, this morning, I plan to cover the details of our second quarter performance and our full year earnings guidance. And while I don't plan to provide specific guidance for 2023 until next quarter, I do want to discuss the potential impact of rising interest rates as well as the leasing commentary that Doug described and our development deliveries. Overall, we had another strong quarter. Our share of revenues and FFO this quarter are up over 10% and 13%, respectively, over the second quarter of 2021. And we reported second quarter funds from operation of $1.94 per share that exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.09 per share. The improvement mostly came from a combination of higher rental revenues, stronger performance at our hotel and lower operating expenses.  Lower expenses drove $0.05 per share of the outperformance and is primarily from the repair and maintenance category. We anticipate that many of these jobs will be completed in the back half of 2022, so the majority of this expense is only a deferral and will be incurred later this year. Our 1 hotel, which is located in Kendall Square in Cambridge, experienced stronger occupancy and RevPAR growth that exceeded our expectations by $0.02 per share. The return of business and educational activity to Kendall Square, along with the college graduation season, drove the improvement in hotel NOI back to the level that we saw in the second quarter of 2019. In the rest of the portfolio, we experienced better-than-projected rental revenues of $0.03 per share from timing of our leasing leading to improved occupancy and higher parking revenue. Our share of parking revenue continues to grow as activity levels increase in our cities and buildings. This quarter, our share of parking revenue grew by $5 million and is now operating at over 90% of its pre-COVID run rate. The outperformance in these 3 areas was partially offset by $0.01 of higher-than-anticipated interest expense coming from both lower capitalized interest, from changes in the timing of our development spend and higher short-term rates impacting the interest expense on our floating rate debt, which includes our new $730 million term loan that we used as a bridge to acquire Madison Center. As Owen covered, we're progressing well with our asset sales and anticipate paying down debt with the proceeds from sales later this year. There are a couple of other items of note in the quarter. First, we closed a 10-year $185 million financing at a fixed rate of 4.43% on our Hub 50 House residential joint venture in Boston. This new mortgage refinanced floating rate construction financing. And second, we recorded $6.6 million or $0.04 a share of other income for assigning our rights to a purchase contract on a building in Reston. This income was included in our guidance but we don't expect it to recur, so you should not expect it in our run rate going forward. Now I'd like to cover the changes to our guidance for the full year 2022. We've increased our guidance range for 2022 FFO to $7.48 to $7.53 per share. That's an increase of $0.06 per share at the midpoint from our guidance last quarter. Our portfolio exceeded our projection in the second quarter. And as Doug described, we had a strong quarter of leasing activity, some of which will result in earlier than projected rental revenues in 2022. The result is an increase in our assumption for our 2022 same-property NOI growth by 75 basis points to now 3.5% to 4.5% over 2021. We also increased our assumption for 2022 cash same-property NOI growth by 50 basis points to 5.5% to 6.5% over 2021. At the midpoint, the increase in our same-property NOI assumption adds $0.07 per share to our full year guidance. We've also increased our NOI assumptions for the incremental impact from properties in our non-same portfolio by about $0.03 per share. The increase is primarily from delivering our 400,000-square-foot build-to-suit for Google in Cambridge. The building and tenant improvements were completed over a month ahead of schedule, so revenue recognition commenced earlier than we anticipated. In addition, we've refined the timing of our asset sales activity, adding incremental income to our model. Doug touched on the impact of rising interest rates. Since we last provided guidance, the Fed has become much more aggressive in its rates policy and short-term rates have risen dramatically. 30-day LIBOR and 1-month term SOFR have risen from approximately 60 basis points in April to just over 2.25% today. And our projections assume they increase to 4% over the next few quarters. We currently have approximately $1.7 billion of floating rate debt, representing a relatively modest 12% of our total debt. This includes $800 million in our share of floating rate debt in our joint venture portfolio, our line of credit with current borrowings of $165 million and our $730 million term loan. The increase in our interest rate assumptions result in higher interest expense in 2022 of approximately $0.05 per share at the midpoint of our range. So in summary, we're increasing our guidance for 2022 FFO by $0.06 per share at the midpoint. The increase is from higher same-property NOI of $0.07, higher non-same-property NOI of $0.03, higher fee income of $0.01 offset by higher interest expense of $0.05. As we look out into 2023, there's a few things you should consider when modeling our projected earnings. First, we anticipate that our interest expense will be meaningfully higher in 2023. While the pace of interest rate increases may moderate, we expect the average interest rate on our debt portfolio will be higher in 2023 than it is this year. We expect the size of our floating-rate debt to remain relatively stable, with repayments from asset sales later this year offset by funding our development spend with our line of credit in 2022 and 2023. We also expect to refinance $800 million of debt that expires in the second half of 2023 in the long-term fixed rate market. The current average rate on the expiring debt is 3.4%. Today, our borrowing costs for 10-year unsecured bonds is between 5.25% and 5.5%. The market has varying views for interest rates in 2023 so it's anyone's guess where they end up. If you assume that short-term rates continue to rise and our long-term borrowing cost remains relatively stable, this results in an average 200 basis point increase in borrowing cost on approximately $1.7 billion of floating rate debt and $800 million of refinancing or about $40 million of potential incremental interest expense in 2023. In addition, we also expect our capitalized interest to be slightly lower in 2023 due to delivering several large developments. Second, we expect our same-property portfolio to continue to grow but likely at a slower pace than the 4% midpoint growth rate we assume for 2022. This year, we're benefiting from the recovery of income from our retail, parking and hotel. With the continued improvement in parking and the strong performance of our hotel this quarter, we've now recovered over 90% of our ancillary income. Our annual growth in these income streams going forward should be more normalized. In the office portfolio, Doug described our healthy backlog of signed leases and leases under negotiation that total over 2 million square feet that we expect will go into occupancy this year and next. Based on the timing of this activity and our lease rollover, we expect our occupancy will decline modestly in the second half of 2022 and then start to increase in 2023. And third, we expect that our development pipeline will add to our earnings in 2023. We anticipate a full year of income from our Google development in Cambridge, and we expect to deliver 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue in D.C. and 880 Winter Street in suburban Boston later this year. We also plan to open View Boston, our 60,000-square-foot experiential observation deck at the Prudential Center in the second quarter of 2023. These developments represent more than $1 billion of investment at an expected stabilized unleveraged return in excess of 8%. In conclusion, we've had a strong second quarter performance, and we've increased our full year '22 FFO guidance. We're projecting over 14% FFO growth in 2022. And despite headwinds from higher interest rates and economic uncertainty, our portfolio is well positioned with modest rollover exposure and growth from our pipeline of developments. Lastly, we're looking forward to hosting you at our investor conference to be held in Boston on September 19 and 20. The conference will be a fantastic opportunity to hear from the broader BXP team, learn more about our current and future strategic initiatives and tour some of our Boston Area properties. If you've not received an invitation, please reach out to our investor relations team. That completes our formal remarks.  Operator, can you open the line up for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] I show our first question comes from the line of John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Doug, you mentioned on your commentary Class A San Francisco is holding up really well. You had a lot of strength in the market among smaller tenants. Can you just provide some more commentary on the makeup of those tenants renting for space, and also the impact of sublease space in the market, including Salesforce across the street from your building? Doug Linde : Sure. So again, as I described, the high-end premier space is really where the market has held up very, very well. And those tenants are, I would describe as, smaller to midsize professional services, asset management, legal, financial services companies, so hedge funds, money managers, private equity firms, law firms, consultants, et cetera. And none of those tenants are looking at a sublet of a floor at 50 Fremont, which is the building you're describing that Salesforce is -- actually put. It's actually not a sublet space because they own that building. That's actually direct space in the market. Operator : I show our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman from Bank of America. Jamie Feldman : I guess just thinking big picture, your comments about some markets seem like they might be coming back faster. You just -- you're growing in Seattle. Just as you think about the future, are there certain markets where you're much more cautious about putting incremental capital to work and some that you are more aggressive putting capital to work here as you just think about how return to the office will work out and space usage will work out and kind of all the changes we're seeing in the market today? Owen Thomas : Yes. Jamie, it's Owen. Look, I think our perimeter is established in the 6 markets where we operate. And as we look at opportunities, they're very much driven from the bottom up. So what deals are available, where do we think there's an attractive return versus risk trade-offs. And sometimes that's in acquisitions that we've been recently doing with partners, and sometimes that's in launching a new development. So I think as -- so you have seen us reallocate capital this year from the downtown of Washington, D.C. to Seattle. That certainly occurred in '22. In terms of the future, again, it's going to be more bottoms up based on the opportunities that we see. It's harder to predict. As Doug described in his remarks, we are seeing stronger leasing activity in Boston, in New York and in the suburban Reston, Virginia markets than we're seeing on the West Coast. Operator : I show our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler. Alexander Goldfarb : So question just putting everything that you've said together. I think if I heard the comments correctly, generally, the office leasing is slowing, but premium buildings like the ones you guys have are continuing to win more than their fair share of leasing. And it didn't sound like you expect any slowdown in the robust 4 quarters of successive leasing that you have. It sounded like that leasing is good. Mike, you outlined $40 million more of interest expense for next year, but in outlining that $1 billion 8%-plus yielding pipeline that's going to be on track to be in service next year, that's an $80 million on the positive. So just putting it all together, is the takeaway that generally, the office market is getting tougher but BXP is winning more than their fair share? And because of the developments, you're way more offsetting rise in interest expense, so net, BXP should be better positioned? Or is that not the right takeaway and that we should think about more headwinds for 2023 and from what's going on? Doug Linde : So let me talk about the in-service portfolio, and then I'll let Mike and Owen describe sort of the other components. So on the in-service portfolio, Alex, I think it would be fair to say that we have a constructive but a moderating view on the leasing that we will do between now and the beginning of 2023. And we're assuming the economy is going to continue to be less strong than it is today. That doesn't mean that we will see any meaningful change in our portfolio outcome. We have some leases that are rolling over that are higher, and we have some leases that are rolling over there are lower. And then we'll -- the real question will be, as we always talk about, whether there are incremental pieces of downtime on spaces that we have leased where we haven't started revenue. So net-net, we feel -- I would say that next year and this year relative to our same-store portfolio, are going to be pretty consistent. Mike, you may want to talk about expense development. Mike LaBelle : Yes. I mean, I think the 1 thing that you got to remember about development, Alex, is all of it is not going to be stabilized day 1, right? So 880 Winter Street is delivering this year, and it will be stabilized day 1 because it's 97% leased. And I think all the tenants are going to be in by the first quarter next year. But 2100 Penn is 61% leased currently. As Doug mentioned, we've got a number of leases in the works, which will take that into the mid-80s percent lease perspective. But most of those leases aren't going to start until mid to late '23. So that building is not going to be stabilized probably until '24, I would say. And I think -- and the other thing I think that's important is View Boston, we believe, is going to have a ramp-up period. So it's a little bit harder to estimate how long the ramp-up will be, and we're highly confident that it's going to have a very strong return when it stabilizes. But the operator that we have that we've been working through believes that there will be kind of a few year ramp-up period. So again, its stabilized return is going to be a year or 2 out. Owen Thomas : Yes. So Alex, kind of pulling all this together, what you're hearing from us is that we are in a less certain economic environment today than we certainly were last quarter. 2023 is a long time from now, and given the uncertainty, it's very hard to predict. So what we're trying to provide is what are all the trade-offs here, what could be up, what could be down. And we don't know the magnitudes of those yet. It's dependent on market forces. So Doug described the leasing. Clearly, the slowdown in economic activity is a headwind to leasing. Absolutely, we believe that our premium assets will get more than their fair share, so that trend continues. Capital costs will be higher. How much? I don't know. It depends on what your assumption is for interest rate. And clearly, the developments will add to our results. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank. Derek Johnston : So the newly formed JV, can we get some more details on the 39-story new development tower in NoVA? And specifically on the JV structure, so really hoping for a private market read-through. So I guess the question would be, are you seeing deep interest from potential JV partners like sovereigns, pensions, other institutional capital? Does it seem ready and willing here to partner up on Class A office? And how deep is this pool versus previous cycles and maybe markets as well as assets? Owen Thomas : Okay. So let me break that question down into some component parts. So let's start with the interest by institutional investors and commercial real estate, then we'll get into the JV in Reston Next. The answer to your question, there absolutely is interest by institutional investors in office and, in this case, by the way, residential real estate. I think the interest is probably higher for the residential, but we continue to look at new investments and developments with the partners that we have done deals with over the last 1.5 years. And we continue to look at new things. So there's clear interest in office real estate. Moving specifically to this joint venture, this is about capital allocation. The yields from the resident -- from a residential development are generally materially lower than an office development. And we are being discriminating with the use of our capital and trying to put it in the highest-yielding opportunities. So, in this case, we decided to bring in a partner for 80%. We own 20%. The office component of the development is higher yielding, so it brings the whole yield from the project to us up. And there is some compensation that we receive as the manager of this development, which augments our returns. So we're putting out less capital. We require less capital to make the investment. We're doing the development and the returns for the capital that we have invested are higher, and that's why we're doing it. And I think you should expect that BXP will continue to work with capital partners certainly on office acquisitions and possibly on developments sparingly. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Just to kind of circle back on the leasing. I guess we've seen big tech kind of hit the brakes pretty hard on leasing. And certainly, they've kind of frozen their hiring. It's unclear, I guess, when that comes back. And Doug, we've seen certainly the biotech industry kind of hit the brakes on leasing. I guess, given the macro uncertainty, I guess at what point do you need to see those things pick up from a timing perspective to be able to move the occupancy needle forward in 2023? I realize there's still time, but I know these things take a while to get the leases in place get signed. So I guess I'm just trying to think through the renewals for next year, the new leasing activity that's slowing, and what kind of pressure that maybe puts on the occupancy build into '23. Doug Linde : Yes. So Steve, you ask an interesting question because if I actually parse down where our availability is, other than Northern Virginia, where we actually have operating assets with vacant floors that would likely be what I would refer to as sort of techy because it's either cybersecurity companies or web services companies or defense contracting companies which have a technology bend to them, the vast majority of our portfolio is really, in terms of our availability, is in our CBD assets, which are not primarily geared towards technology tenants aka Embarcadero Center is a very different asset than, as an example, Salesforce Tower or 680 Folsom Street. So we are not really, I would say, from a portfolio perspective, very focused on what's going on from a technology perspective relative to what we think we can achieve in 2023. But what I'm not saying is that we're not immune to the fact that the technology sector has been a meaningful contributor to the growth in office absorption in every one of our markets. And so it's hard to see the markets improving in any peculiar way without there being a meaningful change in technology companies' desire to take additional office space. So I think that we can surf above the fray relative to occupancy, but we're going to be impacted by the overall market dynamics that are going to be intrinsic to lack of additional absorption because those tenants are just simply not aggressively looking for space today. Operator : I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Griffin from Citi. Michael Bilerman : It's Michael Bilerman here with Michael Griffin. Owen, Doug, I don't know who wanted to take this one. I'm just thinking about sort of strategic direction of the company just from a property type perspective. And as I think about the company is obviously over-indexed to office as what you are, as your primary property type, in the most high-quality buildings, in the most core urban coastal markets. The company has had great success over the years of developing and selling and sometimes retaining, whether it's residential or hotel or retail and obviously, all the life science stuff that's been core to the company for decades. How are you thinking about, given this economic environment that we're in today, and if you look at the residential reports or the retail reports or even the hotel reports that are coming out, there's not as much of a negative drag or uncertainty to which you're talking a little bit about from an office perspective? So is there any thought to perhaps going deeper from a mixed-use or alternate property type relative to office, whether that be through development, which you're already starting to do, or maybe through acquisitions? And just how are you and the Board sort of thinking about the next chapter of BXP and could that be different than from where we are today? Owen Thomas : Michael, it's Owen. So to answer your question, our focus on office will obviously continue to be very important going forward. But let me make a couple of related comments. First of all, we have increased our development of residential assets over the last few years, and I think that will continue. I talked about some of the yield challenges that we have experienced with that, but we also have capital partners that we can work with. So I would anticipate that our residential contributions will grow. We have, as you know, also emphasized more our abilities and assets that are geared towards the life science market. And that segment is about 6% of the company, and we've said we think we can double that over a 5-year period of time. And we continue to develop new assets and grow that segment of our business. So I think that will continue to grow as a percentage. And then I think the other thing that we keep talking about, I think, is critically important is that I think you have to bifurcate the office business between the premium assets and the balance of the market. And the premium assets are something like 15% to 20% of the total assets. If you look at our portfolio, a vast majority of the assets are in the premium segment of the market. And we continue to have dialogue with major corporations about moving into new office developments that we're doing. And these buildings are new. They have the strongest sustainability characteristics, and they're what the clients that we want to serve want. So I do think that the premium segment of the office business will continue to be rewarding to our shareholders over time. Doug Linde : And Michael, I would just add a couple of things. So the first is that we continue to and have moved away from what I would refer to as greenfield ownership of assets, meaning we've looked at our Boston suburban portfolio and said, which of these buildings can we convert to life science because there's a lot more life science demand, we believe, going forward, than there will be office demand in suburban locations. You just saw us sell our VA 95 assets. And I would say that we will likely have a larger overall sales portfolio in 2022 and 2023 than we had in 2018, 2019 and 2020. And that will, to some degree, continue to sort of position the portfolio to be even more select about what it owns and where it owns it and what we believe the characteristics of those buildings are. So we may get slightly smaller relative to the kinds of assets that we own today versus what we will own as we move into the next number of years. And I would say that, that's a conversation that the Board has every single time we get together. Operator : I show our next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley. Ronald Kamdem : I just wanted to zoom in on the spreads this quarter, given sort of there was a big bifurcation by markets, Boston, L.A., Seattle, San Francisco doing 20%-plus versus New York and D.C. sort of in the 17% and 16%. Can you provide sort of any color of what's going on there? What's happening in the market? And how should we think about that going forward in terms of the lease roll, call it, over the next 6 to 12 months? Doug Linde : Yes. So I just -- I want to sort of step back and just provide you with just a commentary that I've made a number of times over the years, which is the data that we provide in our supplemental are leases that are becoming revenue-contributing with the new lease this quarter. And many, if not all of those leases, were done historically at much longer time frames than what's going on today. So as an example, we did a lease in Washington, D.C. in 2019 with a tenant where the rent went down by 15%. It was a 5-year lease and there were no TIs. But it's the new rents commencing this quarter and so we're showing that rent downturn this quarter. When I provide you with the market commentary each quarter for the leases that were signed and executed this quarter, I'm giving you sort of the real mark-to-market that is occurring at the time. So it's impossible to look historically at the data that is in our supplemental and say, well, that's showing you what's going on in the market at that time. And those are historical numbers that are based upon what were our revenue contributions are. So again, so that's -- I gave you the reason for the stuff that's going on in Washington, D.C. And similarly, we did a large lease with a tenant at 601 Lexington Avenue in early 2020, where they took space from Citibank that Citibank was expiring out of and the rent was down. And so that was the logic on that transaction. And again, as I've said time and time again, our New York City portfolio is very sort of chunky on the ups and the downs. And this quarter, again, I sort of aggregated all together and said, of all the leasing that we did this quarter, we were basically flat. It was 0.3% positive. So -- and that's because there were some ups and there were some downs. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck from Wells Fargo. Blaine Heck : Owen, you spoke a little bit about the transactional market in your prepared remarks and how overall volume is down but there's still good demand for high-quality assets. I'm just trying to reconcile that with your expected sales in D.C., which I'm assuming are not some of the best properties in your portfolio, maybe more similar to VA 95. I guess I'm just wondering what's giving you confidence in completing those sales. And how much flexibility do you guys have with respect to pricing on those assets? Are you committed to selling them or is there a price where maybe it just doesn't make sense? Owen Thomas : Well, as I mentioned, there is definitely liquidity for office real estate. Financing buyers being able to arrange financing or buildings that have existing financing on them, I think, are critical for success. And we are at various points along in the execution of the sales of the assets that we are attempting in D.C. And we are encouraged by our progress. Clearly, we're not going to sell for any price. We don't need to sell these assets. We'd like to and reallocate the capital from D.C. to Seattle. But again, I do think there is good demand for higher-quality buildings and financing can be arranged. Doug Linde : And we're needed. And Blaine, I'd say the thematic comment that Owen made during his prepared remarks was, these are all buildings that are selling at what I would say are sort of consistent cap rates. And they're all well-leased with long lease terms. And the assets that we are marketing in the greater D.C. area are generally buildings with long lease terms with very little, if any, exposure to the market over the next 10-plus years. So I think they will -- we expect them to sort of have a similar expectation in terms of the execution because of the nature of the cash flows in those assets. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Nick Yulico : I just want to go back to the guidance and leasing assumptions. It feels like the first half of the year played out a little bit better than expected in terms of leasing volume. I mean, you're raising guidance on the same-store because of some of this. Yet the overall occupancy number that you have in guidance hasn't changed for the year. You just tightened up the range this quarter. So just wondering how much of that is due to, again, sort of just being conservative in the back half of the year. Or you did speak of some level of known expirations. And I'm wondering if that maybe shift on you where you -- there were some tenants you thought might renew and eventually, they decided to not and that sort of prevented you from raising your occupancy guidance this year. Doug Linde : I think that your first comment was the accurate one, which is we are, I would say, slightly less exuberant about leasing activity for the remainder of the year. And so if you look at the data that I provided, I basically said, look, we have 1.7-plus million square feet, actually slightly less than 1.7 million square feet of leases expiring. And I gave you visibility on almost that much leasing that's been done. The issue is some of it's in 2022 and some of it's in 2023. And then I said, by the way, that's what we have active. I will tell you that my active portfolio is not going to simply be all that we do between now and the end of the year or what we do at the beginning of 2023. There are things that will happen that I don't know about right now. We're a big company that does millions of square feet of leasing from every year. And there are transactions that will pop up that will also be part of the calculus here. Again, I don't know likely when those rents will commence from an occupancy perspective. So that's why I would say we're being -- I don't think we're being overly conservative. I think we're being realistic relative to sort of not having as much visibility on the rate of increase as we had as we were looking at the volumes when we talked to you 86 days ago, where there was a lot more going on in the markets in general and in our portfolio. Mike LaBelle : I think the other thing to point to, Nick, is we brought up the bottom of the occupancy by 50 basis points. And that's related to the activity that we're seeing and the leasing that we've seen this quarter. And so that gave us the confidence to increase that. And that's part of the reason we increased our guidance is that we knew that we had some uncovered rollover in the back half of the year. We knew that last quarter. We know it this quarter. But we covered more of it now because of the activity that we had this quarter. So the bottom end was brought up because we don't think we're going to lose as much of that occupancy. But there's still some expiries in suburban Boston. And there's a few floors at 599 Lex and there's a couple of floors at GM, so small amounts of space that are coming back to us that aren't yet covered and we all believe will be covered with leasing we'll do later this year. and that's kind of driving what we believe the short-term increase in vacancy we will see later this year. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith from UBS. Michael Goldsmith : It's more of a philosophical question. I think in the last several quarters, you've talked about how the focus is perhaps more centered on leasing rather than rent growth, given how that flows through the financials. My question now is, how are you thinking about the trade-off, given the macro that you described? And then along the lines, like how can you lean into leasing even more, I guess, in sort of this uncertain macro environment? Doug Linde : So I guess I'll describe it in the following way. So first and foremost, we have a great portfolio of buildings that generally, as I said earlier and Owen sort of reiterated, get more than their fair share of market demand. However, as I also said, we are not immune to what's going on in the market. And so we have to be more competitive, in certain cases, because the market is desiring more in the way of concessions on particular transactions. And so where we have to do that, we're doing that. And we're -- our goal is to utilize our capital as best we can to get occupancy in our buildings with great tenants on a long-term basis, where we think we're going to be in a position where we're going to stabilize the amount of occupancy that we have, hopefully, at that sort of 93% to 94% level as opposed to the 89% to 90% level, which is where we are today. And that's fundamentally where I think we hope to get to with our portfolio. And we're going to do that through active management with our operating teams who are the best in the business in their respective markets and work really, really hard to understand what our customers' and clients' needs are and fulfil them in ways that get traction and allow us to create additional occupancy. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya from Credit Suisse. Omotayo Okusanya : Just wanted to go back to some of the thoughts around interest expense in '23 and just the amount of variable rate debt that will be outstanding, especially with the new term loan on Madison. Curious, how much of that do you expect to kind of fix probably over the next 12 months? And does it make a difference whether it is via you guys raising kind of fixed unsecured to take out the term loan or putting swaps, whether that can make a really big difference 1 way or another in regards to the impact on interest expense going forward? Mike LaBelle : Tayo, this is Mike. So as I mentioned on the refinancings, we have $800 million of floating rate debt -- floating and fixed rate debt. Some of its floating today. About $300 million is floating and about $500 million is fixed, that is refinancing that we're going to fix. The $750 million term loan, we expect to repay and that will be repaid with proceeds from asset sales, and we have some pretty good visibility into that so we feel confident that we'll be repaying that. The development pipeline is -- basically, the funding is something like $150 million a quarter type of run rate over the next, say, 6 quarters. So at this point, we -- our plan is to fund that with our line of credit. It is possible that we could bake the election to do some sort of unsecured financing sometime in 2023 to fix some of that. And so that's possible. So we're looking at those strategies and thinking about those strategies, and we'll continue to. I think that the bond market today, we see credit spreads being wider than they have been historically and reflecting the uncertainty in the economy and the outlook in the economy. And I'm hopeful that those credit spreads will actually become more attractive next year as people have more visibility into what's going on with the economy as we kind of get through the increases in rates and we kind of see where the economy is going. So I think that it's possible that the pricing in those markets actually may be more attractive next year than it is today. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Daniel Ismail from Green Street. Daniel Ismail : I'm just curious how share repurchases factor into today's strategic plan and just your overall thoughts on the overall resilience of higher-quality office versus what we're seeing in the public share price today. Owen Thomas : Danny, it's Owen. We have needs for our capital. We have exciting investment opportunities in development and in some cases, acquisitions and feel that's a better allocation of our capital than repurchasing shares. And we care about the level of leverage of the company, particularly given the economic slowdown that we've described. So that's our priority. Operator : And I show our last question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Mizuho Group. Vikram Malhotra : Just 2 clarifications. One, I think I heard you say something around the stabilized or same-store portfolio into \u201823 being steady. Without giving us a number, could you just \u2013 does that mean same-store is likely to be flat on an absolute basis or actually see some sort of growth? And then could you just clarify on life sciences, somewhat contrast to your peers, one of your peers who reported, just specifically around the view on mark-to-market and leasing velocity near term? Mike LaBelle : I\u2019ll cover the same-property growth comment. What I said was that in 2023, we anticipate that our same-property NOI will grow but likely not at the pace that we saw in 2022, which is 4% at the midpoint, with the reason being that our ancillary income has basically gotten almost to where it was so it\u2019s going to grow but at a slower pace. And we\u2019ve looked at the leasing markets that Doug described, and we\u2019ve throttled back, I guess, a little bit the occupancy growth that we would have expected to have a couple of quarters ago. We still think our occupancy is going to grow from where it is today in 2023 but potentially not as fast as we had thought a couple of quarters ag\u2019. Doug Linde : And I\u2019m a little unsure your question on life science. We have very little in the way of what you refer to as life science rollover in our portfolio because the vast majority of the life science stuff that we\u2019ve done are leases that have either recently or are about to commence. We have 1 building that\u2019s going to \u2013 has a lease expiration in November, which is a building that we acquired about a year ago on Second Avenue, and there\u2019s a material mark-to-market on that when we\u2019re able to re-lease that building. But we just don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t have much in the way of exposure to expirations in the life science business. Operator : Thank you. I'm showing no further questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the conference back to Owen Thomas for final comments. Owen Thomas : Thank you for all of your time and attention this morning, and we hope to see all of you at our investor conference in September. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you.

Owen Thomas : Thank you, Helen and good morning, everyone. Today I will cover BXP\u2019s continued strong execution as demonstrated in our third quarter results. I\u2019ll provide a brief update to my remarks at our recent investor conference on the economy, returned to office dynamics and the premier workplace market. And I\u2019ll discuss private equity capital market conditions for office real estate, BXP\u2019s capital allocation activities and I will provide a reminder from the investor conference of BXP\u2019s strategic shifts given current market conditions. Our FFO per share this quarter was well above both market consensus and the midpoint of our guidance, and we once again increased our forecast for full year 2022. We completed 1.4 million square feet of leasing just below our long-term average leasing activity for the third quarter, and year-to-date, we\u2019ve leased 4.6 million square feet which is meaningfully above our long-term leasing activity for the first three quarters of the year. This success is due to our team\u2019s strong execution, increasing return to the office behavior by workers, and the strong preference of our clients for premier workplaces, which are the hallmark of BXP\u2019s strategy and portfolio. Also in the quarter, BXP reinforced its ESG credentials by earning the highest 5-star rating in the 2022 GRESB assessment, as well as its 11th consecutive Green Star recognition. We also commenced a partnership with the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority as part of the Empire Building Challenge, a public, a private effort to support low carbon retrofits and high-rise buildings in New York City to reduce emissions and combat our climate change. As a company, we remain focused on climate action and are on track to achieve carbon neutral operations in 2025. Now I covered in detail at BXP\u2019s Investor Conference in September, our views of economic conditions, client preferences and in-person work behavior and market statistics for premier workplaces. So in terms of what\u2019s new, inflation unfortunately remains resilient, the Fed remains committed to taming it through higher interest rates, and as a result, markets remain volatile. Workers continue to return to the office as our bad slides grow each week led by non-technology industry clients. Premier workplaces as defined by CBRE represent only 17% of the office inventory in the five CBDs where we operate, and this segment continues to outperform the broader office market. At the end of the third quarter, vacancy in these five CBDs was 9.1% for premier workplaces, and 14.8% for the rest of the market. Net absorption in the third quarter was negative 200,000 square feet for premier workplaces and negative 1.7 million square feet for the rest of the market. Net absorption for the last seven quarters was negative 900,000 square feet for premier workplaces and negative 17.3 million square feet for the balance of the market. Obviously a very significant difference. Given that 94% of BXP\u2019s CBD space competes in the premier workplace market, we believe it\u2019s increasingly necessary to understand operating trends for the premier workplace segment of the market to assess and forecast our leasing performance. In terms of real estate capital markets, transaction volume for office assets slowed to $18 billion in the third quarter, down 11% from the second quarter and down 41% from the third quarter last year. We expect transaction volumes to decline further, particularly in the next few quarters. Debt financing is increasingly expensive and difficult to arrange and many institutional buyers have withdrawn from the market due to real estate over allocations caused by the denominator effect and/or a view that more attractive entry points for new investments will be forthcoming in future quarters. There are however, were several transactions of note in the third quarter. In the office sector the most significant transaction was our sale of 601 Massachusetts Avenue in Washington DC for $531 million to a non-US property company. The 480,000 square foot building is 98% leased and sold for a 5.1% initial cap rate and $1,110 a square foot. In New York City, 1330 Avenue of the Americas sold for $320 million to a private investment firm. The 536,000 square foot building is 85% leased and sold for just under $600 a square foot at a 5.7% cap rate. In the lab sector, there were four significant transactions completed in Cambridge, the seaport district of Boston and South San Francisco for a total of over $1.6 billion. Pricing ranged from a 4.2% to a 5.5% cap rate, and approximately $1,200 to $2,200 per square foot. BXP was active this quarter with capital allocation. We completed a significant transaction with Biogen involving two adjacent buildings in our Kendall Center Project. We acquired 125 Broadway, a 271,000 square foot lab building that Biogen has agreed to lease back for six years for $592 million, which is $2,185 a square foot. Immediately adjacent is 300 Binney Street, 195,000 square foot office building owned by BXP and leased to Biogen for six remaining years. We terminated Biogen\u2019s lease, we\u2019ll convert the building to lab use upsize to 240,000 square feet and entered into a new lease with the Broad Institute for 15 years at significantly higher rents. The total cost to redevelop 300 Binney Street is $210 million, and the building will be delivered in the fourth quarter of \u201824. For both investments, the projected blended initial cash return is over 7%, including the acquisition cost of 125 Broadway and the redevelopment cost, foregone Biogen rent and initial cost base is for 300 Binney Street. The projected blended GAAP yields are materially higher given the 3% annual rent escalations in both the Biogen and Broad Institute leases. We also continue to advance pre-development work for 290 Binney Street, a 570,000 square foot lab development that is 100% pre-leased to AstraZeneca and our 121 Broadway Residential Tower also both located in Kendall Center. Assuming all pre-development hurdles are achieved, we expect these projects will commence in early 2023. Strategically we are making major steps forward in our life science ambitions by acquiring, developing and redeveloping at attractive yields, significant lab space at Kendall Center, one of the leading preferred locations for life science clients in the world. We also just announced an agreement to acquire a 27% interest in 200 5th Avenue one of the top five premier workplaces in the Midtown South submarket of New York City, located directly on Madison Square Park. The building comprises 870,000 square feet and is 93% leased to leading clients such as Tiffany, Grey Advertising and Eataly. The acquisition price for our interest implies a building valuation of $1.5 billion, which equates to just over $1,200 a square foot and a 5.3% initial cap rate. The building has a $600 million first mortgage that matures in 2028 and bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.34%, which is well below current market rates. BXP will assume management and leasing from the current developer who is monetizing their interest in the asset. We are entering into the existing partnership, and as a result, we\u2019ll grow our relationship with JP Morgan Global Alternatives, a leading real estate investment advisor. This investment was sourced off market. Strategically, we are excited to grow our presence in Midtown South and add such a leading premier workplace to the BXP portfolio. We remain active with dispositions as well given the recent announcement of our contract to sell the Avant, a 15-storey, 359-unit, luxury multifamily building in Reston, which we built in 2013. The sale price is $141 million or $393,000 per unit, which represents a 4.3% cap rate on current NOI. We also sold a 10-acre land parcel in Loudoun County, Virginia for $27 million to a data center developer. Both sales along with 601 Mass Ave, will be like kind exchange with the Madison Center acquisition. Our previously described strategy to reallocate capital from the Washington DC region to Seattle is now complete, having sold assets totaling approximately $700 million to fund the $730 million acquisition. We do not anticipate any further sales this year and our total dispositions in 2022 is projected to be $864 million. Our development pipeline remains robust as we added this quarter a 104,000 square foot building at 140 Kendrick Street in Needham, Mass, that we are redeveloping to net-zero carbon performance for Wellington Management and the 118,000 square foot 760 Boylston Street retail building at the Prudential Center in Boston that is also fully leased. Our current development pipeline of 13 office lab, residential and retail projects, as well as View Boston, the observation deck at the Prudential Center aggregates 4.4 million square feet and $2.7 billion of investment that we project based on delivery date and lease up assumptions to add nearly $200 million to our NOI over the next five years at a 7.4% weighted average cash yield on cost when stabilized. The commercial component of our development pipeline is 50% pre-leased. These figures exclude the positive contribution of 300 Binney Street, which will be added to the development pipeline in the first quarter of next year. In closing, I\u2019d like to reiterate the strategic shift BXP is executing as a result of the pandemic and current economic slowdown. We will continue to embrace our leadership position in the premier workplace industry and leverage our strength and portfolio, quality, client relationships, development skills, market penetration and sustainability to profitably build market share. We will pursue attractive asset class adjacencies where BXP has a track record of success, which today are life sciences as evidenced most recently by the transaction with Biogen and multifamily development. We will continue to raise the quality bar for our portfolio and actively recycle capital by selling assets as we did in 2022, subject to market conditions. And lastly, given rising interest rates and financial market turbulence, we will prioritize risk management by actively managing liquidity, investing more extensively with joint venture partners to manage our debt levels, and being highly selective in new investment commitments. The near-term challenges in the capital markets confront BXP and our industry, we are confident our platform, strategy and team will build market share and continue to create value over the long-term. Let me turn the discussion over to Doug. Doug Linde : Thanks, Owen and good morning, everybody. So I\u2019m going to pivot the discussion this morning to our 2023 earnings guidance. We expected and saw a number of notes last night. So obviously this is a critical importance to everybody. And I think we outlined a bunch of the critical variables in the press release and Mike is going to provide some commentary on the most significant components in his remarks. I am going to focus my remarks on our in-service operating portfolio, which is really driving our same property expectations. But I\u2019m going to start with what happened in the third quarter, because I think the trends that I\u2019m describing are going to be relatively relevant to our forward assumptions as we think about 2023. So the third quarter was another you know really good leasing quarter for BXP. It\u2019s now the sixth straight quarter of strong overall leasing activity in the portfolio. Just to remind everybody, beginning in the second quarter of \u201821, we signed 1.2 million, 1.4 million, 1.8 million, 1.2 million, 1.9 million and this quarter, 1.4 million square feet of leases. So that\u2019s about 6.3 million over the last 12 months. Obviously, it\u2019s a deceleration between the second \u2013 the third quarter from the second quarter. We have successfully executed leases with clients in the midst of the delta variant, the Omicron variant, remote work fits and starts, significant labor market headwinds and now what is surely a pullback in business activity. The Boston CBD activity this quarter with about 260,000 square feet of leases, including some renewals expansions and the addition of new clients into the portfolio. The mark-to-market on the previously leased space and again, I\u2019m giving you data on the leases that were signed this quarter, not leases that are in our supplemental, which may have happened you know two or three or four years ago, but the mark-to-market on the spaces this quarter was 15% positive. The lease of 300 Binney Street dominated our Cambridge activity this quarter, and because we are moving from a 2011 office lease to a 2024 lab lease, the markup is over 250%. So it\u2019s a very, very significant increase. The Suburban 128 workspace market remains slow with all of our leasing under 10,000 square feet other than a 55,000 square foot renewal that we did, there the markup was about 3%. This was also an unusually busy quarter for our retail space, including the 118,000 square feet at 750 Boylston, we completed 181,000 square feet of retail leasing in the Boston region this quarter. We didn\u2019t complete any new life science leasing in the Waltham, Lexington portfolio, where we have our buildings under construction. The life science market has seen a significant slowdown. We have available space of both of these developments that we are you know aggressively marketing. As we discussed at our Investor Day, there are a number of other suburban buildings that we have been vacating in order to be in a position to redevelop them as lab buildings. These buildings are not yet under development, so they reduced the portfolio occupancy that we\u2019re showing. At the present time, we have not made any commitments to begin any additional developments with these assets but we are vacating these buildings intentionally. In New York City, we completed 250,000 square feet of leasing, much like Boston, in Manhattan, we saw a number of renewals, expansions and new clients join the portfolio. The mark-to-market on the second-generation space that was recently occupied was down about 4%. New activity in New York City was off in September, but we have seen a meaningful pickup during the month of October. As a case in point, on September 30th, we had no active discussions on our 120,000 square foot block of space at 599 Lexington Avenue. Today, we have three active proposals covering over 70,000 square feet of that space. We completed another lease at Dock 72 this quarter, but WeWork relinquished space on October 1st that will mute the contribution to occupancy as you look at it next quarter. In Princeton, we completed six transactions with professional and financial firms, totaling 40,000 square feet with an increase of rent of 3.5%. In DC, we completed four leases for about 100,000 square feet. This is in CBD including one lease renewal with a markdown of about 12%. Now remember in DC, the lease structure has 2% to 3% annual increases for leases that are generally 10 years to 15 years. So in virtually every renewal, the last year of a 10-year to 15-year lease with a 2.5% to 3% increase is less than the starting rent of the new lease. So that\u2019s typically what we see all the time there. Small financial and professional service firms made up the activity in Northern Virginia, where we saw about 50,000 square feet of activity and the largest lease was only 15,000 square feet. The markdown was about 3.5% on that portfolio. We continue to make progress at 2100 Penn, where we have 90,000 square feet of leases under negotiation that will bring that asset to 80% leased. Finally, in San Francisco, the story is the same as the other markets, though the lack of technology demand is more impactful on overall market segments. We completed eight CBD leases all under 11,000 square feet with professional services and financial clients. The markup was flat with an average starting rent of about $100 a square foot. Down in the Valley, we did 92,000 square feet with three renewals and added one client. The 60 basis points of occupancy loss this quarter was in line with our comments and expectations from last quarter. These three assets were removed from the portfolio. 601 Mass Ave, obviously, which was sold and a 100% leased, 140 Kendrick Street Building A, which is a 100% leased is in redevelopment and our large box at the Prudential Center, 760 Boylston, which is a 100% leased and in redevelopment. [Shearson] [ph], 350,000 square foot 20-year lease renewal at 599 Lex commenced this quarter, and they relinquished 120,000 square feet, the block I was describing. Biogen moved out of the first portion of 300 Binney Street, which will eventually grow by 40,000 square feet when it\u2019s converted to lab and is fully pre-leased. The partial termination is reflected in our statistics not the new lease. Biogen will vacate the rest of this 195,000 square foot building in the first quarter of 2023. So we\u2019re going to lose occupancy on that as we redevelop it for the long-term addition of a lab building. At Santa Monica Business Park, we had a post-movie operation that completed their use of space this quarter and they moved out. Our second-generation leasing this is for the quarter, if you look at our FAD in particular, include the Shearman\u2019s transaction at 599 Lex. They converted a bunch of their free rent to TI and the entire cost for that 20-year, 350,000 square foot lease is in the FAD this quarter, which is why the FAD looks so unusual. The global central bank tightening has resulted in softened demand in all the markets, while tours continue and leases under construction move forward and the negotiation move forward, there is less urgency from clients to make new commitments. We have conversations with potential clients during space tours who acknowledge that economic uncertainty is impacting space decisions. As we consider our expectations for leasing completions in \u201823, we\u2019re factoring an impact of a materially slower economy, softer business performance and reduced demand for space. We expect the bulk of our leasing will continue to come from small-sized and medium-sized professional and financial services firms. So as we think about \u201823, let\u2019s start with what we know. We have signed leases on more than 886,000 square feet of in-service on vacant space that are not in our occupancy figures. Approximately 700,000 will commence in 2023, the remainder in \u201824. At the end of the third quarter, we had active leases under negotiation in the in-service portfolio of about 800,000 square feet, 270,000 of that would currently \u2013 cover currently vacant space that will go into service in 2023. The rest is on our near-term expirations. In sum, we have visibility on about 1 million square feet of currently vacant space and about 500,000 square feet of expiring leases. The remainder of \u201822 and \u201823 totals about 3 million square feet of expirations. This would mean we need to lease about 1.8 million square with 2023 commencements to remain flat. We typically leased more than 1 million square feet on a quarterly basis. Obviously, I described what happened over the last six quarters where the lowest was about 1.2 million. The issue is the timing of these commitments on vacant space, that\u2019s the big wildcard. We just don\u2019t know if we sign a lease, whether the space is going to be in a shell condition or an as-is condition and whether that lease is going to commence in 2023 or 2024. What we said last quarter remains true. We will see a slight decline over the next few quarters as we wait for all signed leases to commence, but in spite of our less robust leasing expectations, we still anticipate an improvement as we move into 2024. Tour activity continues to be strongest in the Boston CBD and New York City markets where the concentration of technology users is the least pronounced and the weighting of market occupancy leads more heavily towards financial and professional services firms. Consistent with my earlier remarks on the third quarter, small-sized and medium-sized financial and professional services firms continue to be the most active portion of our portfolio as those tenants \u2013 clients look for premier workspaces. These users are also active, though to a lesser extent, in DC, San Francisco and Reston. We have all seen the announcements regarding higher increases, job reductions through attrition and explicit job cuts that are occurring on a consistent basis from many of the large technology employers. In some cases, these announcements coincide with decisions to put space on sublet market. It\u2019s hard to envision much technology-related demand growth in 2023. Owen described the stark divergence between premier workplaces and everything else. When clients do make space decisions, we expect them to gravitate to premier workplaces that we have at BXP. I want to make a few more points about the same property portfolio before I hand the speaker over to Mike. The elimination of income from 300 Binney Street as we have redeveloped this fully leased building into a lab building is about $10 million in 2023 relative to \u201822. The reduction in income from the Boston Suburban assets as well as a building in Carnegie Center and Shady Grove properties in Maryland that we are now enabling for life science constitutes a reduction of about $10 million in 2023 from 2022. This positions us to add life science portfolio properties over time. We expect our parking income to be about 90% of the 2019 level and up about 6% from \u201822 estimates. Our retail portfolio has come back in Boston, New York City and DC, where we have a significant number of new spaces under construction with 23 openings. The West Coast continues to be a laggard. We expect little change in contribution from retail in San Francisco in \u201823. The daily traffic in our West Coast portfolio continues to be dramatically lower than the East Coast. We continue to provide extensive subsidies to many of our retail tenants in San Francisco. In spite of the challenges with the new lease at 760 Boylston, we expect the overall contribution from retail to return to 2019 levels by the middle of \u201824 when the lease of 760 commences. In summary, we have reduced our total leasing expectations in \u201823 due to the issues stemming from the aggressive battle against inflation and the ensuing slowdown in the economy. We still expect occupancy improvement in \u201823, though at a reduced rate. Our flat same-store guidance is based on these variables. Mike, take it away. Mike LaBelle : Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning. So today, I plan to cover the details of our third quarter performance and also the increase to our 2022 full year guidance. And I will spend most of my time describing the details of our 2023 initial earnings guidance. The third quarter results were strong. We reported third quarter funds from operation of $1.91 per share that was $0.04 per share higher than the midpoint of our guidance. The improvement came from better than anticipated portfolio performance. Higher revenues contributed $0.03 per share to our results from earlier than projected revenue commencement on space that we delivered to clients ahead of schedule. And we also exceeded our budget for parking revenues, particularly in Boston, where return to office continues to grow. Lower operating expenses also contributed $0.03 per share, this was primarily from lower than projected repair and maintenance costs, most of which will be deferred into the fourth quarter. These positives were partially offset by the termination of our lease with Biogen at 300 Binney Street in Cambridge. The lost revenue resulted in a $0.02 per share reduction in revenue versus our budget that assumed full rent and occupancy for the quarter. While not part of FFO, our net income included gains on asset sales of $262 million or $1.50 per share, primarily from the sale of 601 Mass Avenue in Washington, DC. Our asset sales this quarter raised $540 million in net cash proceeds. On the new investment side, our acquisition of 125 Broadway, a fully leased lab facility in Cambridge utilized $592 million of cash. For the rest of 2022, we have increased our guidance for full year funds from operations to $7.51 to $7.53 per share. That\u2019s an increase of $0.02 per share at the midpoint from our prior guidance. The increase is projected to come from higher revenue from the portfolio and our 125 Broadway acquisition, partially offset by the deferral of third quarter operating expenses into the fourth quarter and higher interest expense from both higher floating interest rates and incremental debt from funding our new investments. The new midpoint of our 2022 guidance represents strong growth in FFO and of $0.96 per share or 15% over 2021. At the midpoint of our guidance, our growth is comprised of 3.75% year-over-year improvement in our same-property NOI and that adds $0.35 per share, $0.63 per share of external NOI growth from acquisitions and developments coming online, and $0.16 per share of lower interest expense from locking in low rates in our financing activities last year. These positives are partially offset by the loss of $0.15 per share from asset sales and $0.03 per share of other items, primarily higher G&A expense. Overall, we expect 2022 to be one of the strongest years for earnings growth in the company\u2019s history. Now I\u2019d like to turn to our initial guidance for 2023. The most significant impact by far to next year\u2019s guidance is the dramatic increase in interest rates in 2022, which is expected to continue into 2023. Stubborn inflation is leading to even more aggressive actions by the Fed that are having a meaningful impact on borrowing costs. Our assumptions include the Fed increasing short-term rates to 4.75% which drives an increase in the borrowing cost under our line of credit and term loan facilities into the high 5% range. We currently have $1.9 billion of floating rate debt that comprises just 14% of our share of total debt. So we still have the vast majority of our debt being fixed. Our floating rate debt includes outstanding amounts under our line of credit, our $730 million term loan and $800 million, representing our share of floating rate debt in our unconsolidated joint venture portfolio. In addition, we anticipate that our floating rate debt will likely increase in 2023 as we use our line of credit to fund a portion of our development spend. A change in our assumption for short-term rates of 50 basis points either way, impacts our projected earnings by $0.06 per share. Owen described the new acquisitions and developments that we announced during the quarter. This use of capital results in a projected $50 million of incremental interest expense. So overall, our assumptions for interest expense in 2023 are an increase of approximately $122 million at the midpoint of our range. This amount includes our consolidated interest expense and our share of unconsolidated joint venture interest expense. At the midpoint, this is an increase of $0.69 per share of interest expense from 2022. Doug provided a substantial amount of detail on the changes in our same-property portfolio. Our leasing assumptions reflect the uncertainty in the broader economic environment that has resulted in elongating the lease-up of some of our vacant and expiring space. In addition, as Doug said, we have several projects that we have targeted for future life science conversions where we are intentionally creating vacancy. We still expect to have a productive leasing year and we have a large backlog of signed leases and leases and negotiation that will go into occupancy over the next 12 months. Overall, we expect our occupancy to be relatively stable year-over-year. We project our 2023 same-property NOI growth to be flat from 2022, and we expect that we will have positive same-property cash NOI growth and our guidance assumes growth of 1% to 2.5%. We anticipate that we will see strong external growth in 2022 from the delivery of development and the impact from a full year of our 2022 acquisition program. Next year, we will fully deliver our 880 Winter Street life science facility that is 97% leased. Our carbon net-zero redevelopment of our building at 140 Kendrick Street that is a 100% leased and View Boston, our immersive observation experience at the Prudential Center. We will also see a full year from our 2022 deliveries, including our Google building in Cambridge, 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue and Reston Next. In aggregate, we project our developments will add between $55 million and $65 million in incremental NOI in 2023. This year, we acquired Madison Center in Seattle and 125 Broadway in Cambridge and we just announced the acquisition of an interest in 200 Fifth Avenue in New York City that Owen described. In 2023, we project these acquisitions to provide an incremental $45 million to $50 million to our NOI. We were also an active seller in 2022 and as Owen described, we currently have the Avant residential building under contract. In total, we project sales for the year of $864 million, which we expect will reduce our portfolio NOI by $28 million to $30 million in 2023. The other \u2013 changes that impact our 2023 guidance are a modest expected decline in fee income due to a $7 million assignment fee we generated in 2022 that we do not expect to recur. And we project that our G&A will increase by approximately 5% next year. So to summarize, we expect our 2023 FFO to be lower than 2022 by approximately 4% or $0.30 per share, primarily due to higher interest expense. At the midpoints of our guidance, we expect growth from our acquisitions and developments of $0.62 per share, offset by higher interest expense of $0.69, a reduction in NOI from asset sales of $0.16, lower fee income of $0.03 and higher G&A expense of $0.04. While we are never happy forecasting a reduction in FFO, 4% is relatively modest and entirely due to a steep increase in interest rates. Our portfolio NOI continues to grow, and we have a significant pipeline of accretive developments delivering over the next few years. That completes our formal remarks. Operator, can you open the lines for questions? Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] I show our first question comes from the line of John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. John Kim : Good morning. I was wondering if you can comment on your occupancy guidance for \u201823. I realized Doug you mentioned some of this is timing related and you\u2019re expecting a slower economy next year. But can you also comment and if you\u2019ve already seen leasing activity slow down this quarter? And also if you\u2019re factoring in lease termination increasing in 2023? Doug Linde : Sure. So I\u2019m going to \u2013 I\u2019ll back up. So that was a three-part but I\u2019m going to give you credit for it all being at least you know consistent with each other. So, the lease terminations are not included in our occupancy. Things are definitely feeling slower in the fourth quarter than they did in the third quarter of 2022. And again, we believe that our occupancy will be higher at the end of \u201823 than it will be at the end of 2022, because we have visibility on a significant amount of leases that have already been signed and we\u2019re covering a significant amount of our existing portfolio vacancy today. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Good morning. Owen or Doug, could you just comment on how you guys are adjusting your return hurdles on development? And maybe just speak to the acquisition of 200 Fifth you know in this environment, you know I guess why pursue acquisitions? Owen Thomas : Steve it\u2019s Owen. Good morning. Clearly, the \u2013 our cost of capital is going up as indicated and what we\u2019ve reported and I do think our hurdle for new acquisitions is going up from a quality standpoint and also from a return standpoint. You know I referenced the 125 Broadway and 300 Binney Street, you know one is an acquisition and one is a redevelopment and the blended yield on that when fully delivered is over 7%. You know buildings in that location, certainly lab buildings in that location have been trading in the 4 maybe even in the low 4s. So I think there\u2019s you know significant margin in that yield versus where we made the investment. And then as it relates to 200 Fifth, a couple of things I would mention. One, I think it\u2019s a very unique property. You know well it is clearly a premier workplace I think transactions like that don\u2019t come around very often. Second, I think the cap rate is understated, because it has below-market debt on the property for the next six years. And then third, we\u2019re purchasing a minority interest of stake. So it is not you know a full acquisition, the billing requires less capital. But our \u2013 you know it is \u2013 we are raising our hurdles for making new investments and you know our pipeline is less right now for new investments as a result. I would say the largest thing we\u2019re working on, I mentioned in my remarks, which is the 290 Binney Street development and the 121 Broadway Residential. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Derek Johnston : Hi, good morning. Thank you. In your discussion with business leaders, do they view the likely recession as a tipping point for possible greater office utilization? And I guess, thus, you know the balance of power you know shifting favoring employers versus employees, especially the mid-level employees? And you know has this factored into discussions with business leaders or perhaps their thinking on future demand for space? Thank you. Owen Thomas : I think the answer to your question is a little bit industry-specific. You know I certainly think amongst the financial service clients that we have, I think the slowdown in business conditions has, I think put some more urgency on in-person work, and we\u2019re clearly seeing that in the traffic, particularly in Boston and New York. I also \u2013 you know I think \u2013 I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s that big an impact yet on the technology sector, where the return to in-person work has been certainly lagging the other industries. And I do think there\u2019s an offset a bit as well in terms of what Doug described of you know a recession, delaying leasing decisions by businesses because there are you know significant capital events. And you know in this kind of environment, businesses try to create optionality on doing those kinds of things. But yes, I do think slower business conditions are leading to more in-person work behavior. Doug Linde : And Derek, I would just add the following, which I think is actually going to be helpful, but it\u2019s not going to be helpful in the short-term in terms of improving things, which is that, as these businesses, I\u2019d say, get more aggressive. I\u2019ll use the word you know asking their employees to \u2013 or associates to come back to work. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to lead to them taking more space. I think it\u2019s going to lead to a better urban platform environment, whereby there are going to be more people in our cities on a day-to-day basis, which I think will be helpful over time at convincing both the workers and the employers that these cities really you know can potentially get back to where they were relative to the Street platforms and be very vibrant local communities. Right now, but one of the problems is there\u2019s sort of this vicious circle going on where because there aren\u2019t as many people going to work every day, the cities feel different and the other sort of issues associated with you know the urban nature of the challenges associated with prime, homelessness, et cetera, become more visible, and there\u2019s a sort of cycle that I think will be helpful as things go in the other direction. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Nick Yulico : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just in terms of JV you know potential you did talk about that at the Investor Day, you know how you\u2019re thinking about maybe you know sales of existing assets or you know funding future development with joint venture partners? And then also you know in terms of the commentary you gave, Owen on you know cap rates for the New York City assets, I guess, in both of those cases, you know the asset you purchased and then the sale [technical difficulty] Avenue in the Americas you know they both had in-place debt as you mentioned that is below market today. And so I guess what we\u2019re trying to figure out is, you know what does this mean for cap rates going forward, if you know instead you have to put new debt on buildings, which our understanding is that if you could even get it for the best buildings, you know your cost of that debt is going to be over 6% today, so does that mean cap rates then would have to be you know over 6% by some fashion in order for underwriting to kind of work in this new world we\u2019re in? Owen Thomas : Okay. I think that was a three-part question, but I won\u2019t stick Helen on you. So, first of all, JVs, we absolutely want to continue to do joint ventures and we absolutely want to continue to sell assets. But it\u2019s going to be subject to market conditions. As I mentioned, there are many institutional investors who are more cautious on the market, some have withdrawn for the market for the reasons I mentioned in my remarks, denominator effect or a view that perhaps the market will get more interesting from a pricing perspective in the future. But again, subject to market conditions, that\u2019s absolutely what we want to do. Going to your comparison of 200 Fifth to 1330 Avenue of the Americas, humbly, I would say, I think 200 Fifth is a higher-quality asset and warrants a lower cap rate. I do think that below-market debt does have some impact on how to think about pricing for the asset, because clearly an asset to have such a below-market debt on the building. And to your point with debt cost rising, I absolutely believe that there is some increase in cap rates. I think it is probably less in the office sector, because I think office buildings have been trading at higher cap rates than some of the other real estate sectors. But I do think it has had some increase on where market cap rates are. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Blaine Heck : Great, thanks. Good morning. So the tone on the call and in the press release sounds a lot less optimistic than at your Investor Day. I wanted Doug, you guys did touch on this, so you guys did in the prepared remarks, but can you just expand on the main kind of factors driving that change in tone, especially in such a short period of time? Doug Linde : So I guess let me just start it back up. So our Investor Day was not about 2023 earnings guidance. Our Investor Day was about, here is Boston Properties\u2019 portfolio regarding its human capital and its assets and what we are trying to do from a strategic perspective in the context of where the market is today. And I don\u2019t think at any time did we talk about what we thought was going to happen in 2023. So I don\u2019t think anything that we said at that conference should be construed as different than what we\u2019re seeing today. Regarding our outlook for actual leasing activity in 2023, we \u2013 I would tell you that we feel modestly less rosy about that, because the Fed has been more aggressive than I think people expected when we had our conference in 20 \u2013 in September 2022 relative to rate hikes. And the inflation has been more challenging to get under control. And all of that has effectively you know transferred itself into a higher interest rate expectation. Mike\u2019s using the dot plot, you know we\u2019re using 4.75% average interest rate for our underlying index in 2022 right. So \u2013 and all of that sort of from my perspective manifests itself in less robust leasing activity in 2023, because I think the economy is going to be less strong, and there are going to be less decisions that are made by companies relative to decisions on their space, be it, staying in place and just upgrading to a premier workspace like our buildings or incremental growth. And so I guess that\u2019s from my perspective sort of the subtle change between what we were describing and you know in September and what we\u2019re talking about this morning. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Camille Bonnel from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Camille Bonnel : Good morning. Given you have only entered an agreement to sell the residential component of the Avant, can you please confirm if this asset disposal is reflected in the 2023 guidance you provided? And at your Investor Day, you mentioned we could see a similar level of sales as we have in 2022. Can you please provide an update on how you\u2019re thinking about dispositions in 2023? Has anything changed here? Owen Thomas : So the answer to your question is, yes, the Avant sale is reflected in the \u201823 guidance. And with \u2013 as it relates to sales, we \u2013 Mike and I both mentioned a figure of $864 million for \u201822, which assumes the Avant is sold, it\u2019s only under contract right now. And then we will \u2013 and I mentioned one of the strategic priorities for BXP is to continue to recycle capital and upgrade our portfolio into 2023. So our goal is to sell more assets since we don\u2019t know what those are, those are not reflected in the \u201823 guidance and it\u2019s going to be subject to market conditions. You know we have specific assets that we are looking at to sell, but it\u2019s \u2013 again, we are going to execute on those sales subject to receiving attractive pricing. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Griffin from Citi. Please go ahead. Nick Joseph : Thanks. It\u2019s Nick Joseph here with Michael. I appreciate the color on the competitive rising rates on the business and guidance. But just going back to the financing market for office assets today Broad lease. You know what are you seeing the differences in terms of lender appetite, LTVs, rates terms on premier versus other assets? Mike LaBelle : This is Mike. I mean I think that the lenders are overall you know significantly more cautious about putting capital out for all the reasons that we\u2019ve talked about. And credit spreads are clearly wider in all of the markets that we deal with. So I mean credit spreads in the bond markets are wider, credit spreads in the mortgage markets are wider. I mean, I can\u2019t say they are at all time lines but they\u2019re significantly wider of where I would say a normal environment is. You know I think that CMBS is underwriting cash flow. And if there\u2019s rollover, they\u2019re very conservative about the rollover and they\u2019re requiring reserves in order to mitigate the risk of rollover and those reserves drive down proceeds levels that are available in the CMBS market for real estate assets. So I think that can drive down some of the leverage that you can get and could impact the refinancing of certain assets that might need to be recapitalized in order to refinance. If you have a high-quality property that has a long lease term, you can clearly get it financed. People will finance office buildings, other real estate with those types of lease terms, there\u2019s just going to be higher cost of capital. So you know treasury that is between 4 and 4.25 and a credit spread that\u2019s probably between 250 and 300, and you\u2019re talking about high 6s is the type of rate that you can get. But that financing is available today. And then the banks are also providing you know mortgage loans and term loans and things like this to the market to add liquidity as well. And you\u2019ve you know seen a number of REITs, including ourselves kind of use term loan financing you know to help fund new acquisitions and new investment. And that market is still available to us. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey, good morning. So a question is on Seattle. Owen, you guys you know obviously entered in the past. And curious with what we\u2019re hearing about Amazon and potentially pulling back from Bellevue, Microsoft potentially you know reverting back to Redmond out of Bellevue. As you guys look at your Seattle exposure, you\u2019ve expanded it, is everything that\u2019s going on in Bellevue and the potential disruption that could occur? Was all that part of your original underwriting? Or has the broader Seattle, Bellevue market changed since you initially entered the market and since you did the latest Madison acquisition? Owen Thomas : So Alex, good morning. No, the Amazon moves in Bellevue were not part of our initial underwriting, because it was not known. We remain confident in Seattle for the long-term. We think we have two \u2013 we have one very high-quality asset and one asset that we\u2019re going to make very high-quality that we\u2019ve already performed some leasing in. We have confidence in those assets. But as Doug described in his remarks, you know the technology industry is retrenching to some degree. You know there have been layoffs announced. There have been space moves announced that you described. And you know we don\u2019t see this as a big provider of growth in the near-term. But I think over the long-term, these companies you know have technologies that will grow and they will be successful, but it\u2019s going to take a while to work through the environment that we\u2019re currently dealing with. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith from UBS. Please go ahead. Michael Goldsmith : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. FFO per share expectations for 2023 is down 4% from what you\u2019re anticipating for 2022. And this is primarily driven by pressure from interest expense as well as some other puts and takes, not asking for guidance, but I guess like what needs to happen in order for BXP to return to earnings growth in the coming years? Can you get there with just the maturity of the development or will it require a combination of more favorable interest rates and stronger fundamental demand? I\u2019m just trying to get at the cadence of what needs to happen in order to get the company back on this path to earnings growth. Mike LaBelle : You know I\u2019ll start, and the others can lob in as well. Look, I think that we have a development pipeline that delivers cash flow through 2025 as it goes into service, and that is going to continue to be a tailwind for us and provide growth for us as we deliver that pipeline and you know hopefully increase that pipeline with some opportunities that we have that we\u2019re working on. On the debt side and for interest rates, I mean 2022 has been an extreme year of interest rate increases and I think that our expectation is that they\u2019ve got a little main ways further to go up, but it\u2019s not going to continue to go up at this pace for the next two, three, four years that there\u2019s going to be a point that has reached where the Fed has done its job and you start to see inflation turn where they\u2019re going to slow down the increases in the Fed rate, which will affect SOFR and that will start to moderate and you know potentially turn the other way, if the economy weakens like we have been talking about. So that\u2019s not in our expectation for 2023, because we assume the SOFR rate is going to go up and then it\u2019s going to stay flat. And we assume the small amount of refinancing that we need to do, which is very small, because we don\u2019t have very much in the way of mortgages coming due that we will have to refinance those at high permanent rates. So we have a $500 million bond coming due, for example in you know the third quarter of 2023. And we can borrow in the bond market today for 10-year is in the high 6s. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re assuming. So that has an impact on our interest expense guidance. If interest rates start to moderate and the 10-year you know comes down a little bit or slows its increase and credit spreads, which right now are as wide as they\u2019ve been in a really long time, start to moderate, because people kind of see the end of the rate hikes and see what the pain is going to be felt in the economy, we could see credit spreads come in 50, 100, 125 basis points which could help. Now, I don\u2019t know when these things are going to happen. But I do believe that you know we won\u2019t see the same increase in rates from \u201823 to \u201824 during 2023 that we saw in 2022. Yeah. Owen Thomas : I would just add to Mike\u2019s remarks, First of all, on the development deliveries, as I mentioned, that\u2019s $200 million of NOI over the next five years, and that number excludes contributions from 300 Binney Street, which are material, which comes in the next couple of years. So that\u2019s the quantification of that. Mike talked a little bit about the interest rate opportunity. And then the last piece is portfolio occupancy. Again, Doug went through a lot of math on how to think about that and the timing for it. But we\u2019re going through a business cycle. You know I said this at the Investor Conference, it called a cycle for a reason. It doesn\u2019t last forever. And this will turn at some point. And you know when you looked at BXP before the pandemic, we were at 93%. So again, we\u2019re not giving any forecast on what the timing for that is, but that\u2019s clearly a growth opportunity for the company is to increase the occupancy of our portfolio. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Mizuho Group. Please go ahead. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks so much. I just you know wanted to go back to sort of the occupancy trajectory and comments. Maybe just if you can unpack it a bit more for us, because you know I came away from the Investor Day definitely thinking there\u2019s upside to occupancy even if you trend sort of lower on the leasing front, and you kind of gave some numbers at multiple presentations. So maybe you can just unpack this a little bit more by maybe the risk to market? Were there more risk? Were there upside? How do we think about just timing-wise or trajectory? And you know just again what\u2019s changed in the last month? It\u2019s a bit unclear just based on what you talked about a month ago. Doug Linde : Yeah. So Vikram, the only thing that\u2019s changed, I\u2019ll just repeat what I said before, is that, I think we\u2019ve moderated the amount of leasing that we will do in 2023 that has a 2023 lease commencement associated with it. And I\u2019ll sort of give you, you know effectively how the sausage is made, you know color on that, which is, when we have space that is currently built out and that space is re-let, we would start recognizing revenue when the lease commences. When we have a piece of space that we make a decision to go and demolish, okay. So we basically remove all the existing improvements. And those improvements are now you know referred to as sort of a white box condition, and we then do that lease, we have to wait until the tenant has completed their build out of the space even if we\u2019re contributing to capital until we can recognize revenue. So we have a bunch of spaces that we are building out as a sort of white box right now, because we think it will give us a leg up in terms of leasing that space that will \u2013 while that may actually improve the timing of actual cash revenue may not help us relative to our \"revenue\" from an occupancy perspective in 2023. So that\u2019s really the only thing that has changed. With regards to the overall sort of you know going around the country perspective, as I think I said, our views and the pulse that we have on overall leasing activity is much stronger in our Boston and our New York City CBDs relative to tour activity and likelihood of transactions occurring than it is on the West Coast in San Francisco and Los Angeles and Seattle. And that\u2019s because the majority of the traffic that we\u2019re seeing are from professional services and financial services-oriented companies who are concentrated in those marketplaces in Boston and in New York City to a wider degree than they are in the West Coast markets, which are more concentrated with technology-oriented companies. And as I tried to describe, many of those transactions are the smaller transactions, right. They\u2019re a floor or less. And so we\u2019re doing a lot more of those than we are a three or four or five floor lease with a client who\u2019s in the technology business. And so I\u2019d say that\u2019s sort of what\u2019s driving our near-term views on our occupancy in 2023. But again, when we were \u2013 you know when we sat up there and made our presentations, we were trying to describe to all the analysts in the room and all the investors in the room and on the phone, how we were looking at Boston Properties from a long-term perspective. And I just \u2013 you know I do want to make the point that we are in a long-term business relative to the decisions that we\u2019re making. So let\u2019s just you know Owen described 601 Mass Avenue and he said, \"Oh, by the way, we sold the building at a 5.1 cap rate. We acquired the land for 601 Mass Ave in 2008. We started a building in 2011. We completed the building in 2013, and we sold the building in 2022. And starting in 2008 to 2022, the unlevered IRR on that investment was 9.65%. So this is a business of long-term decisions and long-term investments. And so while we are focused dogmatically on and providing you with guidance and our expectations quarter by quarter by quarter, because we\u2019re a public company, and that\u2019s what we are \u2013 we are required and want to do, when we\u2019re making our real estate decisions, we\u2019re making decisions based upon long-term investment perspective. And so you know at times that means that we might not be able to satisfy an immediate quarterly you know opportunity to do something, because in the long-term we\u2019re better off doing something that may be you know short-term dilutive. So that\u2019s just \u2013 that\u2019s the way we approach our work in our business from an operating perspective and from an investment perspective. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of David Rodgers from Baird. Please go ahead. David Rodgers : Yeah. Good morning, everybody. Doug, I wanted to follow-up just on the leasing numbers that you quoted earlier. I think it was at the Investor Day, you had signed 1.8 million square feet that probably grew to 2.2 million by the end of the quarter. It\u2019s just simple math. And then today, you talked about 860,000 I think of vacancy leasing. So I guess I wanted to dovetail the combination of those is the rest all renewal leasing? Can you talk about how that reduces your expirations maybe next year and the spreads on that if that\u2019s true and just kind of verify my numbers if I\u2019m thinking about it, right? Doug Linde : So all the numbers I used at the Investor Conference were as of June 30th of 2022. So everything was sort of a quarter delayed and lots of things happened during the third quarter that are now reflected in the numbers, both in terms of leases that we signed that pushed out occupancy and leases that we signed that have yet to commence and leases that we\u2019ve got on vacant spaces that have already commenced that are sort of baked into the numbers. So the numbers that I provided earlier is sort of how I\u2019m looking \u2013 we\u2019re looking at things on a going-forward basis. So instead of the 1 million square feet of leases, for example, that we had that were 1.2 million if that was number of leases that were signed that had yet to commence. Right now, it\u2019s about 1 million square feet or 885,000 square feet, of which 700,000 of that are 2023 commencements in the rest of our buildings that will have a lease commencement in 2024, right. So that\u2019s sort of how I would sort of look at the numbers. So what I gave you earlier today were the numbers as of 9/30/2022. Mike LaBelle : David, I think the only number that Doug gave at the Investor Conference that was different than what we gave today was he didn\u2019t say at the Investor Conference, the amount of square footage that we had signed for leases that were expiring. Now those leases are not in our expiration table because we already have signed leases starting for those. And I think that number was like 800,000 square feet. So that really doesn\u2019t affect the \u2013 I mean it affects occupancy, obviously, because it\u2019s covered, but we don\u2019t have that in our expiration table, because the lease is already covered by a signed lease. Just so you kind of understand the methodology of how we put \u2013 use our expiration table. The expiration table only includes space that is expiring where we do not have a new signed lease starting right away. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Tayo Okusanya : Hi, yes. Good morning, everyone. So you guys talked a little bit about, again, the business being a long-term one, which I you know wholeheartedly agree with. I\u2019m just wondering specifically on the life science side, though, that clearly you know creating more exposure. You are taking back space specifically to redevelop into life science. But again, I think, Doug, you also mentioned the comment that life science demand generally seems to be slowing at least near-term. So just wondering how you kind of balance those two things you know on a going-forward basis where demand seems to be slowing, but you\u2019re clearly also increasing exposure to that particular industry? Owen Thomas : Yeah. So I\u2019ll jump in. Doug may have some comments as well. We have a lot of confidence in the long-term growth prospects in life science. We think there is tremendous capital that is prepared to invest in that space, and there\u2019s also tremendous unresearched science, and it has very strong prospects. I think the other thing that\u2019s important about life science is the importance of location that is critically important and Kendall Center where we\u2019re making most of our investments today is absolutely a key critical, it\u2019s one of the best locations for life science in the world. And I look at all the demand we generated and the deals that we\u2019ve announced. You know we talked about the AstraZeneca lease at 290 Binney Street, the Broad lease that we did at 300 Binney. So you know we\u2019re demonstrating very strong demand at that location. So I do think there\u2019s been more of a slowdown in Waltham. And therefore, we\u2019ve slowed down a little bit of our new deliveries to be responsive to that. But again, you know given my prior remarks, we have confidence that, that will return. Doug Linde : Yeah. And I would just add that, remember that, we are looking at our investment decisions over a long-term and it takes a long time to clear a building of existing tenants. And so you know we want to be in a position where we can start the next building when we\u2019re successful leasing the ones that we currently have or we feel the market has started to you know dramatically change from a demand perspective you know as we enter into the latter part of 2023, early 2024. So we\u2019re sort of \u2013 we\u2019re setting ourselves up for these opportunities. And by the way, I mean, I\u2019m just going to sort of give you some examples, we actually have three proposals that we\u2019re negotiating right now and they\u2019re not leases on you know a building that\u2019s currently vacant in Princeton at Carnegie Center for life science users. And so you know having the ability to stay to one to a user, the building is unencumbered and we can start construction. You know and if you\u2019re interested in signing a lease, we will start construction is an opportunity that we\u2019re trying to create within the portfolio at large. And so you know I\u2019d say we are \u2013 we\u2019re taking some short-term pain for some long-term gain on a going-forward basis. But we think it\u2019s the right approach to expanding you know our ability to do these things you know in a thoughtful way. And by the way, and we said this a number of times, we\u2019re not out there buying the land for you know $200 to $250 in FAR foot, which is what sort of the going price has been for many of these sites you know in locations that require rents that are not supported today. We have a very different land basis in our redeveloped assets because of the nature of when the buildings were purchased, when they were built and you know fact that there always existing infrastructure there that is a value. So we have a relatively speaking you know a well-priced portfolio of opportunities that we can bring to the market over time. Bryan Koop : Doug, I\u2019d add \u2013 this is Bryan Koop from Boston Region. I think the prototype is 880 Winter Street for what Doug is talking about. We\u2019ve got \u2013 we\u2019re positioning other buildings for the same thing. But as we said at the Analyst Day event, we can turn on and off this positive supply with a moment\u2019s notice. And we\u2019re in a great position on our speculative side with 180 already having pre-leasing on it, good activity, not as strong as it was, but good activity. And then 880 is a 100% leased. And we want to have another building just like 880 ready to go when the time is right. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Anthony Powell : Hi, good morning. A question about the mark-to-market. I think outside of Boston was just strong. I think you\u2019re seeing basically flat to down 4% or 5% in most of our other geographies, where do you think that goes in the next year or so? And are you seeing any changes in tenant lease terms or length of leases given kind of falling rent here? Doug Linde : So we\u2019re starting to approach the higher rents that we\u2019ve leased over the past four or five years in market \u2013 in our West Coast markets and particularly, San Francisco, which again is why I \u2013 when I provided the statistics for this quarter, I said, you know we basically were slightly above. It was a couple of percent, and it was about \u2013 the average starting rent was over $100 a square foot, right. So we\u2019re not seeing declines in rents. We\u2019re just not seeing the same relative increases that we were seeing. And so as we get closer to leases that were signed you know x number of years ago, there\u2019s a tighter range associated with what that roll up or roll down is. Relatively speaking, the Boston market and the San Francisco market still have the most embedded growth. Our New York City market is very hit or miss. It\u2019s you know somewhere up and somewhere down. So when we lease a piece of space in the mid-rise to high-rise the 767 Fifth Avenue of the General Motors Building will have an increase. When we lease that piece of space at 510 Madison Avenue where the rents you know were done in you know a decade ago, and we\u2019re increasing significantly and operating expenses went up, we\u2019re going to see a decline. So it\u2019s you know again it\u2019s very much you know building by building, lease by lease. And in our Washington DC portfolio, as I described to you, generally, those you know have come down you know in [technical difficulty] 3% to 5% and in the district, it\u2019s been around 10% because of the nature of the leases from a cash perspective, right. When we actually report GAAP numbers, we actually won\u2019t have these declines, because there \u2013 when you average a 3% increase for 10 or 15 years and the lease that\u2019s starting 10% below what was expiring you actually have a positive mark-to-market. So that\u2019s not what we\u2019re providing, we\u2019re guiding you with a cash numbers a perspective of what\u2019s going on in the marketplace. So that\u2019s sort of my perspective on sort of you know where the embedded growth is. From a transactional perspective, on the margin TIs are still very, very elevated. And it depends on what kind of a tenancy you\u2019re talking to and what their options are. So the larger requirements where there\u2019s more desperation, if you will, from landlords or subtenants that have large box in available space, there are more aggressive terms for smaller transactions, you know a floor or less where the tenant is looking for a premier workspace, we have been able to maintain the economics of the deals that we\u2019re doing in our markets, and that includes you know San Francisco, which again has obviously got a very significant overall you know vacancy in it that the people report, but where the vacancy in the premier space is still significantly lower. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And I show our next question comes from the line of Anthony Paolone from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Anthony Paolone : Thanks. I guess just for Mike, given the discussion and puts and takes on lease commencements next year, where does leverage go over the course of the year and just remind us of where your long-term target is? Mike LaBelle : The leverage right now is 7.5 times, which is basically in line with where our target is. And you know I would expect next year that you know it\u2019s likely to tick up a little bit before it comes down. And then as our development pipeline delivers later next year and then into the following year, you know it would start to come down. And then the dependence is what kind of new investment activity do we have, right. And if we have significant new investment activity, we\u2019ve got to figure out how to capitalize that. But if we don\u2019t have that activity, I think that\u2019s kind of the trajectory. So you may still see it increase a little bit and then start to come down. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Jamie Feldman : Hey, guys. Great. Thank you. I\u2019m here with Blaine. So I guess just sticking with that last response, Mike, your response, you know thinking about the fact that you know BXP, clearly, the interest rate outlook for the company and impact on earnings to the market off guard probably surprised you guys even where you sit today versus where you thought you\u2019d be a couple of years ago. And what does that mean for the competitive landscape? I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a bunch of you know private operators or even public out there that you know having \u2013 you guys have always run your balance sheet particularly well and more conservative and locked in debt costs better than most. You know are you starting to see a lot of distress? And do you expect to see a lot of distress? I know you had mentioned you know wanting to grow more in residential and life science. Will this open up opportunities? And will this stuff be in scale if it\u2019s out there? And if so, how would you capitalize it based on where your balance sheet sits today? Owen Thomas : Yeah, Jamie, it\u2019s Owen. Yes. I think when you go into an environment like this where interest rates have jumped up pretty dramatically, fairly quickly. I do think there\u2019ll be more distress. I think there\u2019ll be less distress in premier workplaces, because those assets are going to perform better. And I think lenders and other capital providers will realize that. And you know as we move forward, you know we will continue to look for opportunities. We will be very focused on pricing, you know given the higher cost of capital that we have. And we will be very focused on our leverage, and I would anticipate you know increasing use of joint venture partner equity to manage our balance sheet. Mike LaBelle : And I think that \u2013 look, we\u2019ve got a lot of cash flow that\u2019s coming online from these developments over the next few years. You know 70% of the debt capital has already been raised that is funding this. So we\u2019ve got a lot of follow kind of capital out there on these properties where income hasn\u2019t started. So yes, we expect our leverage to tick up a little bit as we kind of go through the development process over the next few quarters. But if we don\u2019t do anything else, and we just let this stuff come in our leverage is going to be down into the, you know low 6s. And that\u2019s below our target range. So there\u2019s still capacity on our balance sheet to do things if we find those opportunities. And then it\u2019s a question of how we fund it, right. And I think that in order to continue to lengthen our balance sheet, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been using private capital to help us fund some of these new opportunities. And I would expect that we would continue to kind of look at that as a vehicle to help us do that, because we\u2019re not going to be raising public equity at the kind of prices that we\u2019re at right now. Operator : Thank you. And I show our last question comes from the line of Daniel Ismail from Green Street. Please go ahead. Daniel Ismail : Great, thank you. I might be sounding a bit like a broken record here, but I\u2019m just curious, given on our numbers, BXP is trading at some of the widest discounts on the history on a variety of metrics, implied cap rates, discount to NAV. I\u2019m just curious what would cause any sort of incremental capital to be redirected into share repurchases versus external growth? What are sort of the triggers or is it a duration of these discounts persisting to see more capital go into \u2013 to see capital go into share repurchases? Or what would put that back on the table? Owen Thomas : I think it\u2019s the relative use of capital. So we \u2013 Mike described we\u2019re currently at our target leverage that might tick up a little bit, then it comes down over time. We have \u2013 I mentioned a couple of additional developments that we\u2019re looking at in Kendall Center, which require capital. But I think to look at share repurchases, I think it would be you know our leverage is low, and we don\u2019t have the investment pipeline in front of us that we do right now. Mike LaBelle : And I think Owen described, right. I mean we\u2019re going to \u2013 we\u2019re picky about what we\u2019re going to be investing in. The bar has got to be higher, but we have some opportunities like the ones we\u2019ve talked about in Kendall Square that are you know once in a lifetime kind of opportunities and these are great transactions that are going to grow the value of this company. So investing in our capital and those kinds of opportunities, we believe will be very accretive to our shareholders over time. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back to Owen Thomas, Chairman and CEO for closing remarks. Owen Thomas : Thank you. We have no more formal remarks.

I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks. Owen Thomas : Thank you Helen and good morning everyone. Today I will cover BXP\u2019s continued strong operating performance as demonstrated in our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results. I\u2019ll discuss key economic and market trends impacting BXP and finish with BXP's capital allocation decisions and activities. Despite increasing economic headwinds, BXP continued to perform in the fourth quarter and had strong overall operating results throughout 2022. Our FFO per share this quarter was above both market consensus and the midpoint of our guidance. Our FFO per share grew 15% in 2022 due to development deliveries and strong leasing activity. We completed 1.1 million square feet of leasing in the fourth quarter and 5.7 million square feet of leasing for all of 2022 which is 95% of our average annual leasing over the last 10 years. The weighted average term for leases signed in 2022 was 9.2 years. This success can again be attributed to not only BXP's strong client relationships and our team's execution, but also the increased share of tenant demand captured by premier workplaces, which are the hallmark of BXP's strategy and portfolio. BXP raised $1.2 billion in additional liquidity through a $750 million unsecured green bond offering and the extension and upsizing of a bank term loan ensuring funding for our sizable and substantially leased development pipeline in a challenging capital markets environment. And lastly on 2022, BXP continues to be a decorated industry leader in sustainability having most recently won Nareit\u2019s Leader in the Light Award named the highest ranking real estate company and 29th overall on Newsweek's list of Most Responsible Companies and one of only eight property companies named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. Notwithstanding the running debate on whether the U.S. economy will experience a hard or soft landing, commercial real estate markets are currently in a recession. Many of our clients are experiencing a slowdown in growth or reductions in top line revenue and as a result are focused on cost control including moderating headcount and space use. We all read the daily headlines of layoffs which have been most significant in the technology industry, but are migrating into other sectors. Many companies, particularly in the technology sector are halting new requirements and/or giving back space to the market. The key culprit for the current economic slowdown is inflation, which sparked unprecedented federal reserve tightening measures last year, including rapidly increasing interest rates, quantitative tightening measures, and more regulatory scrutiny of banks. The better news is inflation is starting to come down. The federal reserves is expected to moderate further interest rate increases with the Fed funds rate possibly peaking around 5% and the capital markets with a 10 year U.S. Treasury at 3.5% and rallying equity markets are much less hawkish on inflation than the Federal Reserve. We are not able to predict the depth or length of the current economic slowdown, but its trajectory is coming into clearer focus. Our goal is to position BXP for success regardless of the economy's trajectory by carefully managing leverage and liquidity. The leasing activity is declining due to corporate earnings pressure. The premier workplace segment of the office market continues to materially outperform. Users are increasingly interested in upgrading their buildings and workspaces to attract their workforce back to the office, resulting in an accelerating flight to quality in the office industry. As described previously, CBRE is tracking the performance of premier workplaces in the U.S. and for the five CBDs where BXP operates, premier workplaces represent approximately 17% of the 700 million square feet of space and less than 13% of the total buildings. As of yearend 2022, direct vacancy for premier workplaces was 9.6% versus 14.7% for the rest of the market, also for all of 2021 and 2022, net absorption for premier workplaces was a positive 7.1 million square feet versus a negative 25.4 million square feet for the balance of the market. Rents and rent growth are higher for Premier workplaces and we believe the segment captures well over half of all leasing activity. Including two buildings undergoing renovation 94% of BXP's CBD space is in buildings rated as premier workplaces, which has been and will be critical for our leasing success. Moving to real estate capital markets for office assets, U.S. transaction volume slowed materially to $12 billion in the fourth quarter down 40% from the third quarter. Transaction volume across all real estate classes was down 36% over the same period. Mortgage financing is very challenging to arrange and available for only the highest quality leased assets and sponsors. First mortgage financing costs have risen materially over the past year based on both higher rates and credit spreads. Given the dearth of transaction activity, office asset pricing is difficult to determine, but it is clear cap rates have risen. There were a handful of BXP comparable transactions of note in the quarter. In the Route 128 quarter of Boston, two separate lab sales were completed for a total of $375 million, one sold to a REIT and another to an institutional investor. So one of the transactions is a redevelopment pricing parameters indicate a stabilized yield of at least 6% and pricing per square foot in the mid-900s. In Sunnyvale, California, two separate and fully leased office complexes sold for $415 million, one to a private real estate company and the other to an international fund. Initial cap rates ranged from 4.8% to 6.2% and prices per square foot from 1140 to 1230 [ph]. Regarding BXP's capital market activity in the fourth quarter, we closed both the previously described acquisition of a 27% interest in 205th Avenue in New York City and the sale of The Avant, a luxury residential building in Reston. For all of 2022 we acquired $1.6 billion of lab and office assets and completed over $860 million of dispositions of office and residential assets. So we have additional asset sales in our targeted pipeline. Completion of the dispositions will require more liquid capital market conditions. New acquisitions will be opportunistic and solely focused on premier workplaces, life science and residential development. BXP's volumes for acquisitions and dispositions are very difficult to predict for 2023 given current market conditions. Our development pipeline continues to be active delivering growth to our current and future financial results. This past quarter we fully placed into service the 1.1 million square foot Reston Next premier workplace, which is 90% leased on a long-term basis to Fannie Mae and VW of America. This project was delivered below budget on costs and is projected to yield 7.7% upon stabilization. We also placed into service 880 Winter Street, a 244,000 square foot, very successful office to lab conversion project located in Waltham that is 97% leased. We purchased the office building in 2019 for $270 a square foot, spent approximately $500 a square foot on the conversion and delivered the project at an initial cash yield of 10%. We also commenced the conversion of 105 Carnegie Center, a 70,000 square foot suburban office building in our Carnegie Center asset in Princeton to lab use. This is our first attempt at Life Science at Carnegie Center and we have life science clients reviewing the opportunity. There are two projects, 290 and 300 Binney Street in Cambridge that do not appear on our fourth quarter construction and progress schedule that we are commencing in the first quarter and have an impact on our current 2023 financial projections, which Mike will discuss in greater detail. As described on our last call, Biogen is in the process of vacating the 300 Binney Street office building and we will commence the conversion of the asset to lab use for the Broad Institute, which has agreed to lease the building for 15 years. We have also completed the necessary pre-development hurdles to commence the development of 290 Binney Street, a 570,000 square foot 16 story lab building leased to AstraZeneca for 15 years. We estimate that the project will cost approximately $1.2 billion and expect it to be delivered in 2026 at an initial cash yield in the mid-6% range. Given the annual escalations in the AstraZeneca lease, the initial FFO yield is materially higher. 290 Binney Street is a complicated development entailing the demolition of a 1136 stall parking garage, the temporary relocation of parking capacity from this garage, the construction of a subterranean vault, which will house an electrical substation currently being permitted by Eversource and other facilitating agreements. Commencing 290 Binney Street also creates an obligation for BXP to build 121 Broadway, which is a 37-story, 4,440 unit residential tower which will likely commence in 2024. In addition to these two buildings, BXP also has remaining rights for an additional 580,000 square foot life science building in our Kendall Center development, which due to upfront infrastructure costs carried by the first two projects has the potential to be developed at significantly higher yields than 290 Binney Street. These projects demonstrate the skill of BXP's development team in identifying an opportunity to creatively solve a community problem of locating a new electrical substation and having the expertise to bring the project to reality by solving problems for multiple interested stakeholders, thus creating a highly accretive development opportunity for BXP. After all of these movements and including the 290 and 300 Binney Street projects, our current development pipeline of 13 office, lab and residential projects as well as View Boston, the observation deck at the Prudential Center aggregates approximately 4 million square feet and $3.3 billion of BXP investment that we project based on delivery date and lease up assumptions to add more than $240 million to our NOI over the next five years at a 7.3% average cash yield on cost when stabilized. The commercial component of our development pipeline is 51% pre-leased. So in summary, despite adverse market conditions, BXP had another very successful quarter and year with financial performance above expectations, strong FFO growth, significant leasing success and robust investment and capital reallocation activity. BXP is well positioned to weather the current economic slowdown given our premier workplace market positions, our strong and increasingly liquid balance sheet, our significant and well leased development portfolio in progress, and our potential to identify additional investment opportunities in the current market dislocation. Let me turn the discussion over to Doug. Douglas Linde : Thanks Owen. Good morning everybody. So Owen really spent some time describing the totality of what's going on at BXP. I'm going to be a little bit more concentrated today and talk about demand. Every day seems to bring another announcement of staff reduction from some large or medium sized employer. And while the cons -- these announcements have been concentrated in the technology industries, as Owen described, primarily big tech, we're also seeing them in the finance industry, the legal industry, and broader corporate America. Now I can point to examples of companies in our portfolio that are growing, but we are the first to acknowledge that the pool of clients overall demand that we serve is unlikely to be growing their overall footprint in 2023, aka hard to see much in the way of positive absorption. If there's a silver lining in the job reductions that are being announced, it's an improvement in the labor availability is manifesting itself in encouraging ways. Fewer job listings being offered for remote work. Forms of hybrid work seem to be sticky, but the power dynamic between employers and employees is shifting. Companies are stepping up the days that workers are asked, required, cajoled to come into the office. In our portfolio, we're seeing a steady increase in the number of unique occupants that are in the office each week. We measure the unique number of card swipes on a daily basis where we have turnstiles. These numbers vary day-to-day and if I compare the best day in March of 2022, which is after the last sort of COVID omicron surge versus the best day in January, so a week ago, across the BXP portfolio volume is up almost 40%. I don't know how others measure their usage. BXP measures against the number of seats we have in our spaces. On a daily basis utilization ranges from between 34% in San Francisco, 48% in Boston, and 58% in New York City. And if we look at the number of unique users coming into our buildings on a weekly basis relative to the number of seats, we're currently seeing as much as 82% in New York City, 76% in Boston, and 70% in San Francisco. Our clients are using their space, they're just not coming to the office every day. As Owen said, we've spent a better part of 18 months redefining our business with you as being developers and operators of premier workplaces. As Owen described in his comments, the bifurcation between premier product and general office space continues to widen. The availability rates published by the brokerage firms and reported as headlines in business publications and newspapers, track all of the space. A meaningful amount of the existing office inventory may have a higher and a better use as an alternative product and it's not relevant to users searching for space today. Conversions will happen and we are studying non-BXP buildings in our markets, but this process is going to take years. So the published statistics are going to be sticky even though much of the availability is not attractive to users at any price. In fact, it's hard to see a potential client looking at a BXP offering that would consider many of the buildings captured in the broad market surveys. Again, we have to acknowledge that there continues to be additions to of new sublet or soon to be direct opportunities in premier space from technology companies, 181 Fremont Street in San Francisco being the latest example. Availability in premier space matters, but other issues matter even more. The floor plate size matters. The build out configuration matters. Amenities matter. In markets like Boston or San Francisco, parking availability matters, and the specific location matters. As we explained in our press release last night, while our reported in-service occupancy has declined in the quarter as we said it would on our last call and in our Nareit meetings in November, it is simply due to the addition of new in-service buildings that have leases that have not commenced and are reported as vacant. This includes Reston Next that is 69% occupied and 90% leased and 880 Winter Street that's 85% occupied and 97% leased. Binney: Binney: CBD: The mark to market on the leases we signed this quarter were up 7% in Boston, 9% in San Francisco, flat in New York City and down 11% in DC. It should come as no surprise that we think BXP's premier workspace portfolio is highly differentiated, but on top of that, our operating teams are the best in the business. I want to describe three transactions we accomplished in the fourth quarter that illustrate our team's creativity. In Boston we were getting a 100,000 square feet block of space back in one of our assets. The team identified a client that typically does not do direct deals with landlords, but generally looks at sublet space. We engaged the principles in a tour of the space. The space was in great condition and we were able to secure a lease that met the tenant's desire to have an attractive annual rent as possible in a premier building with limited capital outlay and make a long-term commitment. The lease was executed in late December. In San Francisco a client with a fast approaching termination option in its existing non-DXP building wanted to move to View space. They toured the market in early in December and then identified two spaces in the 34% available market that met their needs. On December 26th, we signed a binding letter of intent. The client understood they were not taking any counterparty risk with BXP and we signed the lease for 50,000 square feet or two and a half floors that were vacant on January 16th. In October, our New York team identified a client that had a lease expiration and no ability to renew in place in mid-2023, which is a very tight timeline. We sent an unsolicited proposal for two vacant floors in our 53rd Street campus. With some persistence we were able to arrange a tour. We mobilized our construction department to deliver the space per their needs and in December we signed a lease for two vacant floors and an option for a third. Owen mentioned that we delivered our life science project at 880 Winter Street this quarter. We also completed our first lease at 651 Gateway. We have available space as well at our two developments in Waltham. The life science market is also experiencing a slowdown in demand. At the present time, we have not made any commitments to build additional projects other than 290 Binney Street, which is a 100% leases to AZ and the 70,000 square foot project that Owen described at Carnegie Center. It's a challenging market. There is not going to be positive market absorption in the near-term. We believe that BXP will outperform the market and we will lease our available space because our portfolio is fundamentally comprised of premier workspaces and the demand that is in the market wants to be in these types of properties. Medium and small financial and professional service clients will make up the bulk of the leasing we complete in 2023. We completed 72 leases during the fourth quarter. Only one lease was above a 100,000 square feet. Tour activity continues to be strongest in the Boston CBD and New York City markets where the concentration of technology users is less pronounced and the weighting market occupancy leans more heavily towards traditional, financial and professional services firms. Not surprisingly, the most active buildings in our portfolio are the GM building and 200 Clarendon. With that, I'll stop and turn the call over to Mike. Michael LaBelle : Great, thanks Doug. Good morning everybody. I plan to cover the details of our fourth quarter performance and the changes to our 2023 earnings guidance. However, I would like to start with a summary of our recent capital raising activities. We've been very busy in the capital markets and have substantially bolstered our liquidity heading into 2023. In the last 120 days, we've executed on three transactions in three different markets. We sold one of our residential buildings in Reston Town Center for $141 million and a 4.3% cap rate. We issued $750 million of five-year unsecured green bonds, and in January we extended and upsized our corporate unsecured term loan to $1.2 billion, an increase of $470 million. In aggregate, the net proceeds raised from these deals is $1.35 billion and we now have liquidity of $2.6 billion, which puts us in an extremely strong position to complete our development pipeline, including our recently commenced 570,000 square foot fully pre-leased, 290 Binney Street Life science project, as well as provide additional capital for other opportunities that may arise. We've also reduced our 2023 loan maturity exposure to $930 million, which is comprised of $500 million of senior unsecured notes that expired in September and five expiring mortgages totaling $430 million at our share. The majority of these mortgages have embedded extension options and we anticipate renewing or refinancing all of these facilities. Given the challenging state of the current debt markets, particularly with respect to the mortgage markets, we are very well positioned. Now I'd like to turn to our fourth quarter earnings results. We reported fourth quarter FFO of $1.86 per diluted share and full year 2022 FFO of $7.53 per diluted share. This is a penny ahead of the midpoint of our guidance and $0.02 cents ahead of street consensus. The improvement was primarily from better performance in our portfolio with our NOI of about $4 million or $0.02 per share ahead of our forecast. The outperformance was a mix of higher lease revenue, stronger results from our hotel in Cambridge and higher building service income, especially in New York City where we see the highest space utilization. The portfolio outperformance was partially offset by a penny of higher net interest expense related to our $750 million green bond offering that was not part of our original guidance. Although not part of FFO I do want to describe that we took a $51 million or $0.29 per share non-cash impairment charge in the quarter, reducing the book value of our equity interest in our Dock 72 property located in Brooklyn, New York. This building is owned in a joint venture where we hold 50%. The building has suffered from weekly leasing conditions in Brooklyn and last quarter the primary client contracted by two floors. It's currently just 25% occupied, although it is 42% leased, including leases that have not yet commenced. Overall, we had a strong year in 2022. We increased revenue by 8% and our FFO by 15% over 2021. Our growth came from our same property portfolio as well as our developments and our acquisitions. Our same property NOI increased 4% over 2021, which was the high end of our range, and on a cash basis it was even stronger with cash NOI growth in our same property portfolio of 6.5% over 2021. Our development deliveries added $0.24 per share to our 2022 earnings and our acquisitions net of our dispositions added $0.10 per share. Now I'd like to turn to an update to our 2023 guidance. As we detailed in our press release, the two most significant changes to our 2023 FFO guidance are the impact of commencing our 290 Binney Street development and the interest expense associated with our new financings. We did not incorporate 290 Binney in our guidance last quarter due to several significant contingencies we needed to clear prior to starting the projects that were outside of our control. Our team successfully closed out these items late in the fourth quarter and we were able to start the project in January. The development plan includes closing and demolishing the existing Binney Street garage. That garage produced $8.6 million of NOI in 2022, and we will lose this income in 2023 and going forward until the completion of the development, which will include a new underground parking facility. As Owen described, the project is projected to be highly accretive to our future FFO, and by the way, all the lost garage income is incorporated into those development returns. We are also required by GAAP to expense the garage demolition costs of approximately $3.2 million. We expect to incur the demolition expense in the first and second quarters of 2023 with no impact thereafter as the demolition will be complete. These two items related to 290 Binney Street will result in $11.8 million of lower FFO in 2023 or $0.07 per share. With respect to our financing activity, we disclosed in our press release in November that our $750 million green bond offering would add $0.08 per share to our 2023 net interest expense and reduce our FFO guidance. As a result, we expect the aggregate impact of starting 290 Binney and issuing incremental debt capital will reduce our 2023 FFO by $0.15 per share. Despite this, our new guidance range for diluted FFO of $7.8, to $7.18 per share is a reduction of only $0.09 per share at the midpoint from our guidance last quarter. That means we've increased the projected contribution to FFO from other areas. Also, we previously communicated the impact of our bond offering, so the reduction is really only a penny per share from our November adjusted guidance. The projected increases come from three places; first, excluding 290 Binney Street, our assumption for incremental contribution to NOI from acquisitions and development is up $0.02 per share. The increase is from higher contribution from our 205th Avenue acquisition and better than projected leasing in our development pipeline. Doug described the increased leasing this quarter in the pipeline and some of that will generate revenues in 2023. Second our revised assumption for net interest expenses are lower by $0.03 per share net of the impact of the bond offering, and this improvement is primarily from higher earnings on our cash balances and higher capitalized interest from changes in our development spend and higher interest capitalization rate. And last, we've increased our guidance for development and management services income by $2 million or a penny per share, reflecting higher projected construction management fees. So to summarize, we've modified our 2023 guidance range for diluted FFO to $7.8, to $7.18 per share, a decline of $0.09 per share at the midpoint. The changes are the result of costs from starting 290 Binney Street of $0.07 and higher interest expense from our bond offering of $0.08. And these reductions are partially offset by higher contributions to NOI from acquisitions and developments of $0.02 cents, higher interest income and capitalized interest of $0.03 and higher fee income of a penny. Our 2023 forecast result in a projected reduction in FFO of 5% from last year after growing 15% in 2022. The reduction is wholly due to the significant increase in interest rates as our portfolio NOI continues to grow and we have a significant pipeline of accretive developments that are delivering over the next few years. As Owen described, it appears that we are close to the end of the Fed's tightening cycle, so interest rates should not be the same headwind going forward. The last thing I would like to mention is that we intend to change the timing of our initial issuance of annual guidance starting next year. We plan to provide guidance for 2024 with our fourth quarter earnings release similar to the other companies in our sector. That completes all of our formal remarks. Operator, can you open up the lines for questions? Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] I show our first question comes from the line of Camille Bonnel from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Camille Bonnel : Hi, good morning. Your guidance mentioned higher contributions from acquisitions and development activities, but it looks like a few initial occupancy dates for offices and life science projects got pushed back a quarter into next year. Can you just provide a bit of color on what's contributing to this outlook and any comments specifically on how the leasing pipeline is going for your construction properties would be very helpful? Thank you. Owen Thomas : So we did a significant amount of leasing at 2100 Penn and a portion of that will contribute in 2023. We did push out by one quarter 360 Park Avenue South based upon where the leasing activity and the development activities are on that asset. And then the other place that we had a little bit of an increase was at 205th Avenue, which is an acquisition we made and we finalized the kind of accounting of straight line rents and fair value rents for that asset. So that's flowing through into our straight line rents next year, which our guidance is up for straight line rents. Doug, I don't know if you want to talk anything more about the development leasing. I mean, you talked about it a little bit on notes. Douglas Linde : Yes, I think in my comments I described sort of where we are, which is big picture we're about 50% leased on our, the totality of our development assets one. And by the way we'll be including next quarter 300 Binney and 290 Binney on our CIP schedule. The leasing is slow at 360 Park Avenue South. The leasing picked up as Mike said at 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue. We're very well leased at the other assets that that got brought on this quarter. So relative to 2023, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see much in the way of changes. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. John Kim : Thanks. Good morning. You spent a lot of time at your Investor Day talking about the occupancy upside potential given your near-term expirations. And I know a lot has changed since then, but you have leased 1.1 million square feet in the fourth quarter. And my question is, how does that compare versus your expectations at the time? And as you sit here today, is 1.1 million square feet, is that a good run rate for the rest of the year? Owen Thomas : Well, you\u2019re asking if I described how we were thinking about the world in September versus the way we\u2019re thinking about the world today, I would tell you that there\u2019s been a material change in the overall economy relative to the risk of recession and I think there is less demand in the overall environment than there was then. We still feel really good about the overall quality of our assets and the ability to capture incremental demand in the marketplace due to the nature of the tenants that are looking for space. And so again, we actually exceeded our own internal projections at the end of the year because we thought we would be slightly below where we were in the third quarter. And again, if you sort of adjust for bringing these new assets into service and simply put them in at their actual leased occupancy or remove them, we actually increased our overall occupancy during the year. And so I would tell you, if you look at our exploration schedules for 2023 and you look at the 1.5 million square feet we\u2019ve already leased, and we will, again, hopefully be leasing somewhere in the neighborhood of 750,000 to 1 million square feet per quarter, we should again be increasing our occupancy as we move through 2023. Michael LaBelle : Yes, John, and just to add, I mean, we\u2019ve maintained our guidance for our same property portfolio and for our occupancy. So our kind of outlook is similar to what it was when we gave guidance last quarter. I think that our occupancy in the first quarter, so three months from now will likely be lower or flat than what it is today. But we\u2019ve got a lot of leases that are already signed that Doug described, the 1.5 million square feet that are coming into play. And I think that\u2019s starting in the second quarter we're going to see our occupancy grow from there through the rest of the year. And a lot of this occupancy is in coming in some of the major markets like New York City, we've got a number of leases that are signed that we\u2019ll be starting in the second quarter. Doug described a deal in Boston that we did just in December, and that deal is going to start in the second quarter. And we also have some deals in Reston starting. So I think that we feel we\u2019ve been conservative in our approach to our guidance based upon what we see future leasing activity as, but we feel good about the guidance that we provided. John Kim : Thank you. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Steve Sakwa : Yes, thanks, good morning. I didn\u2019t know if you could talk a little bit about maybe Platform 16 and 360 Park Avenue South. And I know both of those buildings were sort of geared towards tech tenants and Doug given your comments about slowing tech demand and even some of these tenants subleasing, I\u2019m just curious how you\u2019re maybe altering the marketing program there or do you just need the macro environment to really get better to see traction on both of those buildings? Douglas Linde : So let me ask Hilary Spann to talk about 360 Park Avenue South, and I\u2019ll ask Bob Pester to comment on Platform 16. Hilary Spann : Thanks, Doug. Hi, Steve, how are you doing? So at 360 Park Avenue South, the redevelopment is underway. We are very far along in discussions with a retail tenant that is going to be very exciting when we\u2019re able to announce it. I think it\u2019s fair to say that the demand for 360 Park Avenue South is diversified, but tilted toward tech and media firms because of its location in the Midtown South submarket. And to the point that everyone has been making on this call, that leasing velocity has slowed dramatically starting probably in the end of the second quarter of last year, maybe early third quarter of last year. And so we\u2019re proceeding at pace with the development, and we expect to deliver it as per our original estimates. And some of the demand that we have seen for that building is actually in a more traditional industry groups, finance, the industries that support finance, et cetera, but no question that the leasing has slowed there. And so we\u2019re thinking that rather than looking at 150,000s, we may be looking more at 50,000 to 75,000 square foot tenants to fill the demand for that building. Steve Sakwa : Bob, thank you. Robert Pester : Yes. Hi, Steve. So on Platform 16, the project doesn\u2019t deliver until 2025. And as we\u2019ve told them many times before that San Jose Silicon Valley market is a build and they will come market that typically tenants don\u2019t look at the buildings until they can walk the building or get a feel that this deal is going up. We still see it as a tech building. It\u2019s the only building that\u2019s going to deliver in that 2025 timeframe in the Silicon Valley it\u2019s new. So we\u2019re still optimistic that over the course of the next 24 months that tech user will materialize for the building. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Blaine Heck : Great, thanks. Good morning. The fourth quarter seemed to be a slow leasing quarter in the overall market. U.S. BXP did relatively well compared to the market. But can you talk about whether you think you\u2019ve seen a change in the level of demand or leasing activity thus far this year? And maybe more importantly, what do you think needs to change to get some of the tenants that have been reluctant to sign longer leases to meet those longer-term commitments. Douglas Linde : So Blaine, I am -- and I\u2019ll let Owen make a comment as well. I hope that my comments were both honest and thoughtful regarding what I think we think the demand picture is, which is there is less overall demand in the market today due to the nature of the business economies changes. And we don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be much of any positive absorption occurring. We think we will lease more space than our peers because we have premier work places that are geared towards the tenants that are in the market and then that are making decisions. And I don\u2019t actually believe that the tenants that are looking for space are concerned about making long-term decisions. They are, in fact for the most part, making long-term decisions, and we are still doing longer-term leases in all of the leasing that we\u2019ve been doing in the last couple of quarters, some of it hasn\u2019t hit the lines yet in terms of our occupancy numbers. But so, I can\u2019t tell you how long the economy is going to be where it is, but as the economy recovers, traditionally jobs and/occupancy are second derivative events associated with that, and so it will be a period of time before tenants are \"growing\" again. But Owen, maybe you have some other ideas? Owen Thomas : No, you covered it well. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey, good morning. Good morning. First as a comment, maybe Dock 72 would be good for resi conversion, if you\u2019re taking suggestions from the cheap seats. A question for Ray, is in D.C., it\u2019s good to see the politicians and including in Congress addressing the work from home endemic that\u2019s with the federal employees. My question for you though is, how much does work from home for government workers really affect like Reston Town Center and the private office market? I would guess that one, GSA doesn\u2019t really sign high-priced deals; two, just given what\u2019s been going on I\u2019m guessing more of the private investment market is focused on private companies or DoD or other security tenants who have to be in office. So just sort of curious your take on what\u2019s going on in D.C. and how much we need government workers to come back for the market to flourish? Raymond Ritchey : Well, first of all, Happy New Year, Alex. Thanks for the question. It\u2019s living here in the district, it\u2019s really kind of frustrating to see the federal workforce not fully engaged in the return to work. The real estate roundtable has been very effective in reaching out to Mayor Bowser and really stressing to her the importance for the federal workforce return not only just in terms of consumption of office space, but the social fabric of the city is completely deteriorating with the workers not coming and we\u2019re also very concerned about the impact upon metro. Before the pandemic, there was almost 800,000 riders a day on the metro. Now there\u2019s less than $300,000. And that will have an impact on the public transportation system here. As it relates to Reston, specifically, we have a very large portion of our tenants who are engaged in government contracting support to the federal government. And the policy of the federal government not to return to work also is impacting occupancy in Reston. And while many of them have the requirement to be in the office because of the security nature of their work, it still impacts the more traditional office support tenants for the federal government contractors. So it\u2019s impacting Reston from presidents of the retail, it impacts things like the fitness center and other support activities we have in the building. So even though we\u2019re a diverse tenant base there, the lack of the federal government coming to work is still impactful. We're really assisting to the leadership in the district, the importance for the federal government to return to their offices. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Griffin from Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Griffin : Great, thanks. It seems like relative to your East Coast peers as West Coast markets continue to lag, I guess what sort of concern do you have for the long-term viability of a market like San Francisco? And if there were a bid, would you look to maybe allocate capital out of there? And then, Doug, one thing I wanted to clarify real quickly on your leasing comment. I think you said 39% of the leases this quarter came from renewals, some of which took the same amount of space versus some amount that downsized? What percentage of the same space versus downsized? Thank you. Douglas Linde : So Michael, I don\u2019t have all the data in front of me. When I actually looked at it the other day, in terms of the number of tenants, there were two or three tenants that downsized, but they were larger. I mean, the biggest example being, we had Zillow/Trulia, which renewed on two out of six floors at 535 Market Street, but there were one or two tenants like that. The majority in terms of the number of tenants that signed leases that did renewals actually were staying in basically the same number of square feet. Owen Thomas : And then it's Owen, to answer your question about West Coast and capital allocation, you are right. The West Coast is lagging from a return to office perspective and also from a leasing perspective, is driven by the fact that there\u2019s a much higher percentage of technology users in those markets and those users are not using their office to the same extent that their industries are. And so far, they\u2019ve led other industries in terms of layoffs, which impacts space use as we\u2019ve described. Look, we\u2019re going through a cycle and word cycle means it goes down and it comes back up. This has happened before. Every cycle is different, but they all look somewhat the same. And I\u2019m convinced this is a cycle as well and we will have a recovery. And I think the technology industries, the institutions that exist in California are not going to go away, but we are going to have to work ourselves through the recovery that we see ahead. Michael LaBelle : Michael, one thing I\u2019d like to add is on the kind of tenants expanding versus contracting, we have done an analysis of the rent leases that commenced in 2022 for renewals. And we had about 4 million square feet of leases that commenced and we had actually those tenants expanded by 6% or almost 300,000 square feet. In the fourth quarter, it was a reduction of about 100,000 square feet, but overall, some expand, so contracting. Again, this is only tenants that renewed in our portfolio or they took on additional space before their lease came up. It doesn\u2019t have doesn\u2019t count tenants that either left our portfolio, and I don\u2019t know what they did before that or they came into our portfolio and we don\u2019t know what their size was before that. But that\u2019s a signal that not every tenant is contracting. There are many tenants out there that are continuing to take more space. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson from SMBC. Please go ahead. Richard Anderson : Thanks. Good morning. If I could just play a little devil's advocate on the premier office, excuse me, Premier Workspace Motif that you\u2019re talking about here. In a deep recession type of environment, is it potentially an outcome where you could see a reversal of the trends that you\u2019re seeing relative to conventional more cookie-cutter office, where people are looking for cheaper alternatives and maybe your premier office product becomes more vulnerable in a deep recession type of scenario. Is that something that has happened clearly, it\u2019s happened in the past, but I mean what gives you comfort that won\u2019t be an outcome for you this time around? Owen Thomas : Yes. No, I certainly understand the logic of your question. I\u2019d answer it simply that history has not shown that to be the case. Higher quality buildings have outperformed in recessions in the past. And I think this recession is different because of the work from home and the flexibility that technology is providing for workers. And therefore, I think this flight to quality and change of how we describe our business from office to premier workplace is more important. I think the market share that the premier workplaces are getting in this downturn is actually much higher than it has been in previous downturns. And it\u2019s important when you look at our business to not look at the overall market statistics but to focus on the premier workplaces because that\u2019s actually the market that we\u2019re competing in. Douglas Linde : And I would just add, Rich, that two things. One is most, I think, of the economists pundits would say if we hit a recession, we\u2019re not going to go into a clinical deep recession. But if you had a deep recession, and we\u2019ve had deep recessions in the past, typically, what has happened is there has been a compression in the pricing between Class A and Class B, meaning Class A has come down to a level that makes it so attractive that it squashes Class B demand. And people look at the relative opportunity set and jump at taking additional space in great buildings because there has been a dramatic reduction. We don\u2019t believe we\u2019re any going to see \"deep recession\" but that is what has historically happened. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Anthony Paolone from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Anthony Paolone : Yes, thank you. I was wondering if you could comment on dispositions. And in terms of anything you might have in the market right now or expectations for this year and whether or not you think that could be additive or dilutive to where you put guidance at this point? Douglas Linde : Yes, we have assets that we would like to dispose of non-core assets. But as I mentioned in my remarks, the capital markets are very liquid just generally, but also, I\u2019d say, for office assets. And therefore, we didn\u2019t put out a guidance on what we thought dispositions were for this year because we don\u2019t -- the market is not cooperating at the moment. Hopefully, that will change, but we can\u2019t forecast that right now. Owen Thomas : And Tony, if something -- if we were to be in a position to sell something, unlikely that we\u2019re going to put anything on the market in the beginning of 2023, which means any transactions that are likely to be weighted towards the far back end of the year. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ronald Kamdem : Hey, just looking at the 1Q guidance of $167 million, when I compare that to the 4Q number of $186 million, any sort of -- that\u2019s a $0.19 delta, any sort of high level, how much of that is sort of the G&A seasonality versus this sort of onetime charge you talked about versus interest cost would be helpful? And if I could sneak another one in, just on the View Boston opening up in April, just sort of curious sort of how the marketing, how the interest and an update there would be helpful. Thanks. Owen Thomas : So while Mike looks at his numbers, I\u2019ll let Bryan Koop just describe sort of where we are with our plans from a marketing perspective on the Observatory in Boston. And we haven\u2019t officially announced the date yet. So... Bryan Koop : Yes. The great news is, given what we worked during the last two years in construction, we\u2019re actually ahead of schedule and turned out beautiful. We\u2019re doing marketing tours with people that would like to look at events in the future. I\u2019d say we\u2019re oversubscribed on that, and we\u2019re determining how we want to execute that because as each of these observatory locations are fairly highly bespoke and different. And we have a good deal of space that we can do the events. Pre-marketing is going really well. The City of Boston is gearing up for tourism and we\u2019ve seen a big response from that sector in call-ins to our team. And in general, we\u2019re just focused on hiring people and getting staffed up for F&B and the overall staff, but we feel really great about it. We feel awesome about how it\u2019s turned out. It\u2019s just spectacular. Michael LaBelle : So Ronald, on the first quarter, you\u2019re right, it\u2019s obviously down because it\u2019s seasonal. We have a hotel that is seasonal that because it\u2019s located in Massachusetts it has very few people that come to it during the winter. So it actually loses money in the first quarter and that it has profit to the other three quarters of the year. And then our G&A expense is front-loaded because of vesting and payroll tax issues. And then obviously, we borrowed more money in the fourth quarter. So we expect our interest expense to be higher in the first quarter than it was in the fourth quarter. The portfolio itself is actually -- we expect it to be up slightly. And then going out for the following quarters because if we started $1.67, right and our guidance is much higher than that for the full year. Obviously we see pretty significant increases in the following quarters. And as I mentioned, we expect our occupancy to start to move up in the second quarter. Bryan just talked about View Boston, we expect that to open up in the second quarter. So there are several things that are occurring in the second and third quarters that are going to push the FFO up later in the year. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Dylan Burzinski from Green Street. Please go ahead. Dylan Burzinski : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just curious, I think the story thus far has been that office landlords have been able to hold base rents and they\u2019re giving up more on the concession side of things. But just curious, Doug, given your comments about not expecting positive absorption in 2023, is this the year that we start to see landlords sort of deal up on the face rent side of things? Douglas Linde : I guess, I don\u2019t think landlords, at least this landlord is never going to give up on anything. And we -- look, we have situations in our portfolio where we have very little space in a particular building. And we\u2019re very comfortable and able to handle both relatively modest concession packages and strong face rates. We have other pieces of our portfolio where we have vacancy or availability where we are trying to be aggressive about increasing our occupancy. And so in those cases, we are thinking about all the arrows in the quiver and figuring out what the right approach is for a particular client that we\u2019re trying to serve. Some of those clients would prefer to have free rent. Some of those clients would prefer to have more CapEx in terms of transaction costs. We might even agree to do turnkey builds in certain cases, and some of them may be looking for a lower \"annual run rate\" and sort of use the concessions in a different way. So I think it\u2019s very hard to sort of try and articulate a particular component of an economic deal that is being done with a client of ours and sort of say, we\u2019re going to gear towards one thing or another because we try and meet the needs of those clients. In general, transaction costs are higher. Why? Because there is more available space and it\u2019s still very expensive for a company to move or relocate or grow, and the landlord is contributing capital for that, and it\u2019s coming in the form of either additional free rent or additional TI, it\u2019s generally not in the form of the \"face rent\" on the deal. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to change much as we approach 2023. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Peter Abramowitz from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Peter Abramowitz : Hi, yes. Thank you. Just do you have any comments or commentary you can give around the restructuring announcement from Salesforce from about a month ago. I think they said they\u2019re both looking to divest their own real estate holdings, but also reducing their footprint, where they lease space. Any conversations you\u2019ve had with them and any impacts to your portfolio? Douglas Linde : Yes. So I\u2019ll just make a comment, and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Bob. So we have one building, which has a long-term lease with Salesforce.com, which is Salesforce Tower, which is to some degree, their preeminent building and is the preeminent building in San Francisco. And Bob, why don\u2019t you comment on any conversations we\u2019ve had with Salesforce regarding their utilization of space? Robert Pester : Yes. They\u2019ve got multiple buildings on the market. They\u2019ve got 53 miner across the street that they own with 400,000 feet. They had several 100,000 square feet per lease in 350 Mission; they got space available, the space that was occupied by Slack. All the indications we\u2019ve had so far is, they\u2019ve indicated no interest in subleasing any of the space in the tower. But if they do, we\u2019ve got 9-plus years existing weighted average lease term on their lease in that building. So we\u2019re really not too concerned about it. We do get calls constantly about major tenants. We just had one this past week for 100,000 feet, that would like to be in the tower, but we don\u2019t have any space available. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Anthony Powell : Hi, good morning. Just a question on acquisitions, what you target in terms of [indiscernible] space changed in the past few months given the environment, would you be less willing to do deals like 360 Park Avenue, given the leasing there and more targeted sort stabilize or financial tenants. Maybe just comment on what you\u2019re looking for would be great. Owen Thomas : So as I mentioned at the outset, we have the capital in the balance sheet to make additional acquisitions but we are in -- the market is repricing. And so, yes we are going to be very focused on valuation for any acquisitions that we would look at in the coming year. Michael LaBelle : Yes, I would also say I would add to that. We are, as I mentioned in my remarks, our focus is going to be on premier workplaces, life science and residential development. Douglas Linde : Yes. And I would just add the following, which is if we\u2019re looking at an existing asset, they\u2019re obviously, if we can\u2019t make it a premier workplace, we\u2019re not going to spend time on it. If we think we could, then it\u2019s going to be a question of what our views are on how long it will take us to lease up the space. And I would say that we\u2019re constructive about our markets, but we are realistic as I think all of our comments this morning were about the overall absorption of space in the marketplace. And so, I\u2019m not sure our underwriting is necessarily going to match with the seller\u2019s expectations for what they think their buildings are. We will look at stuff. We will be thoughtful about it. We will make offers. But whether there\u2019s inability ability for there to be a meeting of the minds, I would say we\u2019re skeptical that will happen in 2023. Operator : Thank you. And I show our last question comes from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Nicholas Yulico : Thanks. A question for, I guess Owen or Doug, I was hoping to get a feel for -- as you\u2019re having conversations with your JV partners, pension funds or other potential institutional partners, what is their attitude right now towards office space, particularly in relation to investing incremental capital into buildings? What types buildings are still possible, what aren\u2019t? And ultimately, how you think this is all going to affect office building values? Owen Thomas : Yes, I think generally, institutional investors in real estate, not just the office are cautious at the moment given higher interest rates, slower leasing volumes that Doug just described and what the repricing is. And so, I think investment volumes generally from institutional investors have gone up \u2013 have down materially. So as it relates to office, I think it\u2019s going -- I think there is capital available from institutional investors for premier workplaces that are underwritten with the new cost of capital as well as the leasing dynamics that Doug described in the last question, which is we have a slower leasing environment and the assumptions when you\u2019re underwriting a deal need to reflect that. But assuming you have all those pieces, I think there\u2019s capital available for premier workplaces. Douglas Linde : I also think the other thing to think about here too is the -- we talked about the institutional investment world as its some homogenous group of investors. Well, it\u2019s not. They all come from different geographic locations. They all have different funding sources. They all have different funding obligations, and so they don\u2019t operate in a unified fashion. So my comments are not targeted to any one group, but I would just point that out. Operator : Thank you. That concludes the Q&A session. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Owen Thomas, Chairman and CEO for closing remarks. Owen Thomas : Yes, thank you all for your time, attention and interest in BXP. Have a good day. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

We ask that those of you participating in the Q&A portion of the call to please limit yourself to one question. If you have any additional query or follow-up, please feel free to rejoin the queue. I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks. Owen Thomas : Thank you, Helen and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover BXP's continued steady operating performance as demonstrated in our first quarter results. The key economic and market trends impacting our company and BXP's capital allocation activities and funding. Despite significant economic headwinds, BXP continued to perform in the first quarter. Our FFO per share was above both market consensus and the midpoint of our guidance, and we increased our FFO per share guidance for all of 2023. We completed 660,000 square feet of leasing in the first quarter with a weighted average lease term of 7.7 years and kept occupancy flat despite more challenging leasing market conditions. Finally, BXP just published its 2022 ESG report and announced our second annual ESG investor webcast for May 31. Though the office sector is clearly facing challenges in the current economic environment, there are two underappreciated trends, which we believe will have a significant impact on BXP's longer-term performance. First, the deceleration in leasing, which we forecasted last year and are now experiencing driven primarily by the economic slowdown, a cyclical trend rather than remote work a secular trend. In other words, we believe the current leasing slowdown is cyclical and will recover along with economic conditions. Our clear evidence for this observation is our own leasing experience. In 2022, when the economy was much stronger and significantly fewer workers were using our offices, we leased 5.8 million square feet, essentially a normal year just below our 10-year average level of leasing. This year, the economy is clearly weaker, but many more workers are back in the office and our leasing has slowed. Though we are not in a recession defined as negative GDP growth, approximately 75% of S&P 500 companies are forecasting lower earnings this quarter and aggregate earnings are expected to drop over 6%. There are seemingly daily announcements of corporate layoffs. With slowing growth, companies are more focused on cost control, reducing headcount and taking less or reducing their space. In addition, capital market volatility on the heels of recent bank failures drives companies to be more cautious in capital outlays, including capital required for leasing new space. With more challenging economic conditions, the return to office trend continues to improve. Major tech companies have announced return to work expectations and specific policies and many companies in a variety of industries continue to tighten their requirements, increasing the days expected in the office. President Biden has mandated a substantial increase for in-person work at federal offices. U.S. West Coast cities, though improving, remain behind the rest of the U.S. and other global business centers in their return to office work. The second underappreciated trend is office users are much more discriminating about building quality than the current market sentiment regarding the overall office asset class. The Premier Workplace segment continues to materially outperform the broader office market. Users are compelled to upgrade their buildings and workspaces to attract their workforce back to the office. Clients increasingly prefer assets with the highest quality managers and consistent and stable ownership, buildings facing debt default do not have the tenant improvement and leasing commission capital available to complete leases and are therefore uncompetitive. Lastly, full or significant remote work is more frequently allowed and practiced for support workers across industries in areas such as accounting, IT and HR. This segment of the workforce does not as commonly occupy premier workplace assets, putting more pressure on the market for lower quality buildings. As described previously, CBRE is tracking the performance of Premier workplaces in the U.S. and for the 5 CBDs where BXP operates, premier workplaces represent approximately 17% and of the 733 million square feet of space and less than 10% of the total buildings. In the first quarter of this year, direct vacancy for Premier Workplaces increased only 20 basis points to 10.7% while direct vacancy for the balance of the market increased 80 basis points to 15.5%. Also for the first quarter, net absorption for the premier segment was a negative 200,000 square feet versus a negative 3.3 million square feet for the balance of the market. For the last 9 quarters, net absorption for the Premier segment was a positive 6.9 million square feet versus a negative 28.6 million square feet for the balance of the market. Rents and rent growth are higher for Premier workplaces, and we believe the segment captures the majority of all gross leasing activity, including 2 buildings undergoing renovation, 94% of BXP CBD space is in buildings rated by CBRE as Premier workplaces, which has been and will be critical for our long-term success. Moving to private real estate capital markets, U.S. transaction volume for office assets slowed materially to $6.6 billion in the first quarter, down 47% from the fourth quarter of last year. The reduction was by no means an office-specific trend as transaction volume across all assets -- all real estate asset classes was also 43% lower over the same period. Real estate values have reset down due to higher capital costs, and sellers have so far been unwilling to accept lower prices, creating a bid-ask gap common and declining markets. Mortgage financing for office is challenging to arrange and available for only the highest quality leased assets and sponsors. Given the dearth of transaction activity, office asset pricing is difficult to determine. But there were several data points of note in the quarter. In the Seaport of Boston, ARE announced the sale of a 37% interest in a lab development at 15 Necco Street to an offshore property company for a valuation of over $1,600 a square foot and approximately a 5.4% cap rate. The building, which is being delivered into service later this year comprises just under 350,000 feet and is fully leased to a strong credit life science user for 15 years. In Downtown New York City, a global property company purchased the 49% interest did not own in One Liberty Plaza for $426 and a square foot at a 6 cap rate, 6% cap rate from a global fund manager, the 2.3 million square foot building is 80% leased. There are several smaller non-premier workplaces currently in the market, testing pricing at cap rates of 7% or greater. Regarding BXP's capital market activity in the first quarter, we completed the acquisition of a 50% interest in World Gate, a residential conversion opportunity located on World Gate Drive in Herndon, Virginia near Reston Town Center for $17 million. The property currently consists of 2 vacant office buildings comprising 350,000 square feet and a 1,200 stall parking garage all situated on a 10-acre site. The plan, which is subject to receiving entitlements is to demolish the 2 office buildings and reuse a portion of the existing garage to support a 349 unit rental and for-sale residential development. DXP will serve as managing member and developer in partnership with Artemis Real Estate Partners, the current owner of the project. Development is not expected to commence until 2024. Additional new acquisition opportunities will undoubtedly grow in this environment, and we will remain highly opportunistic and solely focused on premier workplaces, life science and residential development. We added the previously described 290 and 300 Binney Street developments to our active construction pipeline this quarter and now have underway office lab retail and residential projects as well as view Boston in the observation deck at the Prudential Center. These projects aggregate approximately 4 million square feet and $3.3 billion of BXP investment with $1.9 billion remaining to be funded and are projected to generate attractive yield upon delivery. We have received recent inquiries about our funding sources and needs, which is understandable in the current market environment. We currently hold elevated levels of liquidity and have access to both the unsecured debt market and private secured mortgage market for select assets, albeit at higher rates and spreads than a year ago. We could also monetize select residential assets and attract JV partners into our lease development pipeline. Our internal discussions on funding strategy are not about whether we are able to access capital but rather how to best select and sequence our capital raising options to minimize costs and maximize flexibility. Mike will provide more details in his remarks. In summary, despite unconstructive market conditions, BXP had another productive quarter with financial performance above and leasing in line with expectations. BXP is well positioned to weather the current economic slowdown given our position in the premier workplace segment, our strong and liquid balance sheet with access to multiple capital sources, our significant development portfolio and progress and our potential to gain market share in both assets and clients due to the current market dislocation. Lastly, on an organizational matter, John Laing, our Senior Vice President, who oversees the L.A. region has elected to pursue professional interests outside of BXP John joined us 7 years ago and has been an important contributor to BXP's growth in the L.A. region. Melissa Cohen, a LA native and former project manager in BXP's New York office, will rejoin BXP as Head of Development for L.A. Alex Cameron, our current Head of Leasing in L.A. and Melissa will be BXP's senior leaders for our L.A. region. These changes will be effective at the end of June. Let me turn it over to Doug. Douglas Linde : Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. So I think it's fair to say that we are operating in a challenging real estate supply and demand environment. And as Owen stated, businesses continue to make pronouncements about the importance of in-person work, but office job reductions related to the economy have impacted both supply and demand. In our portfolio, we continue to see incremental pickup in daily activity as we look at the month-to-month trend lines, and we see weekly patterns emerging based upon industry. The legal professions got a different perspective than asset management, which is different than private equity. People using their spaces at different times. The frequency of work, however, in the office is really about 3 days per week across our markets where we track the data, and this includes San Francisco, obviously, our portfolio being primarily professional services and financial services. No city is back to the levels of urban work activity that existed in 2019. We are aware of isolated instances where an organization has required all their employees to work in their existing office most of the week and they don't have enough space, but that's just not the norm. The pendulum could swing back to where organizations find themselves short on space for their existing and future workforce, but it's not the way they're planning today. The most dynamic and expanding reservoirs of demand over the last decade, technology and life science users are focused on profitability, cost reduction and capital preservation. This doesn't lead to near-term positive absorption. There's a lot of variability with the financial services and professional services firms space needs. Those that are reducing headcount through layoffs are replanning their facilities with less space. It's evident that some law firms in the market are signing leases with smaller footprints as they move to a more uniform office module, while a few are actually taking additional space. The concentration of user demand strength in 2023 is broadly speaking, alternative asset managers, private equity, venture, hedge funds, specialized fund managers. These companies are growing their teams and their capital under management. This pool of clients typically wants to occupy premier workplaces and it's not surprising that BXP's strongest activity is at the General Motors Building in Manhattan, 200 Clarion and the Prudential Center in Boston, 2,200 and 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue in D.C., the urban core Reston Town Center in Northern Virginia and our Embarcadero Center assets in San Francisco. By the way, we just don't have any space available at Salesforce Tower, which is why it's not on the list. The challenging office supply picture is not a New York or a San Francisco story. There is high headline availability in virtually every market across the U.S. Availability rates are at or above 20% in coastal and Sun Belt markets. These availability rates published by the brokerage firms and reported as headlines track all of the space in every pocket of each market. We spent the last 2 years redefining our business as being developers and operators of premier workplaces and explaining why these headline numbers hold much less relevant. Owen gave the most recent data which demonstrates the dramatic bifurcation between premier workplaces and general office space. Availability and premier assets matters and the location and the specific attributes of those buildings matter. The client looking at 399 Park Avenue is not considering space on Third Avenue, Midtown South or downtown. If a 20,000 square foot client wants to be in a premier building in the Back Bay of Boston on a single floor with primarily exterior office configurations, there are limited availabilities. If a 40,000 square foot tenant the client wants to be in view space north of 42nd Street and South of 59th Street between Fifth Avenue and Lexington, there are limited availabilities. This is why we could recapture a 30,000 square foot floor at 200 Clarin in this quarter and released the space as is with immediate occupancy to a new client. This is why we can lease the floor with a mid-2024 expiration at 399 Park Avenue this quarter with no downtime to a growing client at the building. Last quarter, I described the 50,000 square foot client in San Francisco, the lease space at Embarcadero Center, and had 2 alternatives outside of a renewal. The headline information that was reported by the brokerage committee, it's true, it's factual but it's just not nearly as relevant as people think in our business. BXP's regional teams are leasing space. We completed 660,000 square feet of transactions during the first quarter. On our last call, we gave an expectation of 3 million square feet for the year, which translates to about 750,000 square feet per quarter on average. We have reaffirmed this at the Citi conference in March in our public webcast. There were 57 leases across our markets. 29 leases were with new or growing tenants, 410,000 square feet and 28 renewals totaling 250,000 square feet. We had 10 expansions and 3 contraction. As we sit here today, we have signed leases that have yet to commence on our in-service vacancy, totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet and 1.2 million square feet of that space is anticipated to commence in 2023. This quarter, we added a secondary occupancy statistic that shows the effect of these signed leases on our quarterly occupancy. Our headline in-service occupancy stands at 88.6% and with leases signed but not commenced, it rises to 91%. This portfolio includes our in-service properties and it does not include the development portfolio, which is up to 4 million square feet and is 52% leased. We currently have leases in negotiation totaling 900,000 square feet, and we have a current pipeline of additional active proposals totaling over 1.5 million square feet. I would expect us to sign 95% of the leases in negotiation and more than 50% of the 1.5 million square feet of proposals. So to summarize, we have active dialogue on 1.65 million square feet of space as we end the first quarter of '23. If 40% of these leases are in vacant space or 223 expirations. It should add about 660,000 square feet of space to our occupancy. We have 1.2 million square feet of signed leases with an anticipated 2023 commencement. Together with the leasing pipeline, this adds 1.86 million square feet to our occupancy. Our remaining 2023 expirations are 2.2 million square feet. We have additional activity across the portfolio and still expect to lease 3 million square feet this calendar year. The mark-to-market on the leases in the supplemental, show we were down about 3% overall and D.C. was down 47%, which was a little bit shocking. This is due to our restructuring of a 70,000 square foot Regal cinema lease in Springfield, Virginia. If you exclude the Regal cinema lease, the portfolio was up 2.5% and D.C. was down 10%. We were up 21% in Boston, down 9% in New York City and up 6% in San Francisco. The leases we signed this quarter on second-generation space were essentially flat across the company, with Boston up and the other markets slightly down. During the quarter, we experienced on life science default on 12,000 square feet at 880 Winter Street where a forum biotech company shut down its U.S. operations. This was one of the spaces we built on a speculative basis in 2022. We are negotiating a new lease on the space as is with a rent that's 9% higher than the prior rent. To provide some perspective on our life science credit exposure, our total annual revenue from in-service life science clients is about $226 million or 8% of our total revenue. 70% comes from public companies with equity market values over $1 billion. The other 30%, $68 million is made up of 66 clients, 20 public and 46 privately funded. We've also signed leases that have yet to commence with total annual revenue of $128 million, 90% is with Roche Genentech, AstraZeneca and the Broad Institute. Activity in the life science market continues to be slow across both Greater Boston and South San Francisco, and there is new unleased space being added to the market. There are a few large requirements that are touring, but as I have previously discussed, the bulk of the demand is from small private companies that are looking for fully built space. Our new client at 880 Water Street fits this profile. We are also negotiating 3 additional leases at the development project at 651 Gateway in South San Francisco totaling 57,000 square feet. The property will open in 2024, and each lease requires our partnership to complete turnkey spaces. BXP will outperform the market, and we will continue to lease the available space because our portfolio was fundamentally comprised of premier workplaces and the majority of the demand new and existing clients in the market want to be in these types of properties. Medium and small financial and professional service clients will make up the bulk of the leasing we completed in '23. We completed 57 leases during the first quarter. We had 4 leases over 30,000 square feet and only 1 above 50,000 square feet. Occupancy cans will be captured through lots of small- and medium-sized leases and renewals. We will have some contractions and we will also have some expansions. Tour activity continues to be strongest in the Boston CBD New York City Plaza District and San Francisco, where the concentration of small professional sirs and financial firms are concentrated. I'll stop here and turn the call over to Mike. Michael LaBelle : Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. So I am going to cover the details of our first quarter performance and also the changes to our guidance for the year. But before I do, I would like to address a couple of questions we've received from shareholders, and we'll start with a discussion of our liquidity, our near-term capital needs and the state of the debt markets from our perspective. There's been a lot of talk in the media about the lack of financing available for commercial real estate. And while we agree that underwriting criteria is tighter and financing costs, both in terms of credit spreads and reference rates are higher there is financing available for high-quality, well-leased premier workplace assets and portfolios. In fact, in the past 6 months, we issued $750 million of unsecured green bonds in the investment-grade bond market and extended and increased our term loan with a syndicate of banks to $1.2 billion, providing $470 million of incremental proceeds. We are currently in a strong position with $2.4 billion of liquidity comprised of $900 million of cash and full availability under our $1.5 billion line of credit. We do have 2023 capital needs, including funding our development pipeline and refinancing expiring debt facilities. For the remainder of 2023, we project to spend approximately $750 million to fund our developments. Our consolidated 2023 debt maturities are limited to a $500 million bond issuance expiring in the third quarter of 2023. If you extend the window into 2024, we have another $700 million coming due in the first quarter of 2024. The bond market experienced volatility and higher credit spreads in March, coming out of the bank failures over fears of a broader crisis. In April, the market has settled down, and our credit spreads have come in meaningfully. We believe we could issue a new 10-year bond today at between 6.4% and 6.7%, which is inside the pricing we issued on a 5-year deal last November. Credit spreads are still wider than historical levels, but the market is open, and we expect to continue to monitor it as an option for our refinancing needs. In our joint venture portfolio, we just exercised a 1-year extension on our mortgage loan for the Marriott headquarters located in Bethesda, and we have an additional option to extend it to 2025. Our remaining 2023 mortgage expirations totaled just $287 million at our share, and we have an extension option available on $168 million of this. The expiring mortgages are for the Verizon anchor Hub on Causeway new development in Boston that is 94% leased and 500 North Capital in Washington, D.C. that is 100% leased. We expect to refinance or extend these loans in the mortgage market and are actively working on term sheets. As Owen mentioned, we have a broad array of capital sources that we consistently evaluate that are available to us in varying amounts in cost to fund our capital requirements. The unsecured bond market has been a reliable debt capital source for us for over 20 years. We have a very liquid outstanding bond complex and a supportive core of fixed income investors who have partnered with us for years. As I just mentioned, the market is opened, but at a cost higher than our historical levels. The mortgage market is also available to us. We have a large portfolio with over 90% of our assets unencumbered. This allows us to selectively secure assets if we want to raise capital and appropriately leveraged and well-leased premier workplace can be financed in today's mortgage market at pricing inside our bond pricing. We're also active in utilizing institutional private equity to help fund our acquisitions and development activities. And although investors are highly selective, they continue to evaluate investment opportunities with us. We have an attractive pipeline of well-leased developments and existing properties that represent unique offerings to these investors. Asset sales are another source of capital. And in the past 4 years, we've sold over $2 billion of properties and have efficiently recycled the capital into newer investments. The asset sales market has definitely slowed dramatically with the increase in interest rates. So it is a lower probability for us in 2023. However, we have properties that we could sell, including assets in our multifamily portfolio that are more liquid in today's market. So while the public discussion continues to be broadly pessimistic on real estate and the availability of capital, we continue to have plenty of flexibility with strong liquidity and multiple sources of debt and equity capital that we can turn to. Another question we've received from investors is about our dividend policy, given we are trading at a historically high 8% dividend yield. We have maintained a consistent dividend since the beginning of 2020. Our FAD provides reliable coverage of our dividend, such that we're able to reinvest excess cash flow into the growth of our business. We've been successful in selling assets annually and fitting the gains on sale within our regular dividend policy without the need for special dividends. Long term, our goal is to maintain a steady dividend and increase it over time as our developments add to our income. In the near term, a slowdown in expected sales activity would create room in our dividend relative to the REIT distribution requirements. If our outlook for the economy and the capital markets become more negative and asset sales slow, we do have flexibility to modify our policy. Now I'd like to turn to our earnings results. We reported first quarter FFO of $1.73 per share. Our results exceeded the midpoint of our FFO guidance by $0.06 per share. Nearly all of the variance to our guidance is from higher-than-projected NOI from our portfolio with $0.05 coming from lower operating expenses and $0.01 coming from higher rental revenues and fee income. The expense savings are the result of lower energy costs due to both lower commodity prices and reduced utilization related to the mild winter in the Northeast. We also incurred lower repair and maintenance expenses than expected. As a result, we're increasing our funds from operations guidance for 2023 by $0.04 per share at the midpoint. Our new range is $7.14 to $7.20 per share. Our full year guidance increase is less than the Q1 FFO beat as we expect a $0.03 of our Q1 operating expense savings will be moved into the rest of the year in the form of lower expense recoveries and the deferral of repair and maintenance expense. So the $0.04 increase in our full year guidance includes $0.03 of improvement in our portfolio NOI and that is comprised of $0.02 of lower expenses and $0.01 of better-than-projected revenues. While we're increasing our portfolio NOI guidance overall, we remain comfortable with the same property guidance range that we offered last quarter. This includes our assumption that same-property NOI growth from 2022 will be flat at the midpoint of our range. While on a cash basis, we expect same-property NOI growth of 1% to 2.5%. We have increased our guidance for fee income for the full year by $0.01 per share. The increase is a combination of higher construction management and development fees. We've made no changes to our interest expense assumptions. Currently, we are assuming an additional 25 basis point increase in short-term rates and then rates remaining flat for the rest of 2023. So to summarize, we've increased our guidance range for funds from operation to $7.14 to $7.20 per share. The increase is $0.04 per share at the midpoint and it comes from $0.03 of better projected contribution from our portfolio and $0.01 of higher fee income. The last item I would like to cover is a reminder of the diversification and credit quality of the leases in our portfolio. Doug provided some of the details on the 8% of our portfolio leased to life science clients. And if you take a deep dive on our technology clients, the results are very similar. Tech clients comprise about 17% of our revenues and over 80% is from large publicly traded companies. We have 85 leases with smaller public and private technology companies with an average annual rent of about $1 million each. Our Check and life science clients comprise 25% of our revenue base. The rest of our portfolio consists of a diverse mix of financial services companies, law firms, other professional service firms, media, real estate, retail and manufacturing companies. Overall, our portfolio is incredibly diversified by client, by industry sector and by geography. And our weighted average lease term is approximately 8 years which leads to manageable annual lease expiration exposure. This portfolio construction is by design, given our focus on premier workplaces that attract a high-quality client base that desires longer-term leases and are focused on attracting and retaining a talented workforce. Operator, that completes our formal remarks. If you could open up the line for questions, that would be great. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And I show our first question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Doug, I appreciate all the comments that you made on leasing. I did notice that there really was no, I guess, incremental leasing on the development pipeline outside of the 2 new projects that got added. So could you maybe just speak to the pipeline that you talked about, how much of that leasing that you're in discussions on is for the development? And I guess, how do you still feel about the projected yields on the development pipeline today? Douglas Linde : Sure. So the pipeline of unleased property, Steve, is pretty bulky, right? So it's primarily in 2 places. It's in Platform 16 in San Jose, which won't deliver until the beginning of 2025. And as you probably can surmise, there's not a lot of technology demand in the market today. So there are no conversations going on there. And the other large bulk you want is 360 Park Avenue South. And we are starting to have conversations with smaller-sized tenants, so 1 to 4 floors. Hilary, I'll let you sort of comment in a second on that. But the overall -- and you'll notice are an increase in our costs on some of our development assets because we have pushed out the leasing time frames and therefore, we're carrying those properties for a longer period of time, and obviously, interest expense is meaningfully higher than when we started these projects, and that's impacting that. So the returns on our development assets will be slightly lower. I -- it will depend on the leasing success that we have, Steve. So I can't give you a comment on how many basis points they're going to be. But Hilary, if you want to comment on Park Avenue South. Hilary? Operator : Next question in the queue comes from the line of John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : You discussed extending some of your maturities on your JV mortgage debt and debt market overall, the mortgage market being inside bond pricing currently, which really goes against the grain of the issues we're hearing with the regional banks. I was wondering if you could just elaborate on how healthy that market is and who's willing to put more capital into office assets today. Michael LaBelle : So I think that the conversation around regional banks is something that is obviously out there. They're not necessarily lenders to us on properties like ours. We do have credit with the larger kind of multinational and global banks that we do business with and some of the super regional banks, I would call them. And then there's life insurance companies, there's pension funds, and there's the CMBS market, which the most active part of that is really the conduit marketplace. And there's been several large conduit offerings that have been distributed to the marketplace, including, I think, three in the last month where the office component of those are somewhere between 15% and 25%. And those loans are generally on an individual side, maybe $50 million to $100 million. You could do a larger loan and do a conduit, say, $200 million, $250 million, and you get a slight step into a couple of different securitizations. So again, I think that if you have a good quality income stream to finance in a good building with good tenants and long weighted average lease term, that will get recognized by the financing markets. And we've been talking to the market. We have term sheets on deals that we're working on, where there's a desire to do loans for those types of properties at credit spreads that are still higher than what they were. But their credit spreads that are below what it's currently in the bond market right now, not significantly below, but below. So as I said, we've got a couple of these mortgage financings that we're working on that we anticipate that we're going to execute on. And those are the markets that we're dealing with. Douglas Linde : John, this is Doug. I'll just give another perspective. So we have a lot of what I would refer to as highly financeable assets with long-term credit leases and where we would likely go and finance, for example, a 15-year Google lease for fivce years or a 12-year Microsoft lease for 5 years, right? And we're not doing these 75% LTVs. We're looking for a modest amount of leverage. So those types of assets, we believe are highly marketable to the various counterparties in the lending community, be they insurance companies, be they domestic or foreign banks, be they the CMBS market. So that's sort of where we're looking for additional capital. And then as Mike suggested, we have a maturity in a relatively small-sized asset, a $100 million asset in Washington, D.C., and we had a number of term sheets from secured lenders on that. And so we are seeing evidence that our portfolio is as being receptive to additional secured initial. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Camille Bonnel from Bank of America. Camille Bonnel : Following up on the leasing pipeline, can you please comment on how you classified deals in the active proposal pipeline? And how this pipeline compared to last quarter or even a year ago? Douglas Linde : So the way I characterize things is if we are negotiating a lease document, it's part of that 900,000 square feet. If we have an active conversation and are exchanging letters of intent, but we have not yet confirmed a letter of intent, AKA, meeting of the minds, and we haven't started a lease negotiation, that's sort of in that other pipeline. And I would say we have slightly more stuck in the active proposals or active negotiation stage than we had last quarter, largely because some of the stuff that I thought was going to get done in the first quarter reached into the second quarter. There are 2 meaningfully larger deals, meaning over 100,000 square feet that we had -- we thought we had a chance of signing in the first quarter that just didn't get signed yet. And our active proposal pipeline is, I would say, modestly growing sort of quarter-to-quarter, but pretty consistent with what it's been the last 2 or 3. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Anthony Paolone from JPMorgan. Anthony Paolone : Yes. So I appreciate all the color on capital markets and how you're trying to triangulate where pricing might be. But just for BXP for you to put capital out the door right now, what would you all want in terms of an IRR, how would you underwrite rents and cash flow growth? Like what would a deal that would prompt you to pull the trigger on look like? Owen Thomas : It's Owen. A couple of things I would say. One -- first thing would be, what is it? So we're not going to go out and buy a cheap office building in the hopes that we can make it less cheap over time. We're going to focus on premier workplaces in the office segment. We're going to continue to focus on our life science portfolio, and we're also going to focus on residential development, probably more as a merchant builder as opposed to a long-term owner. So I think perimeter is very important. Look, in terms of overall -- yes, in terms of overall cost and what we're going to be looking for. One, it's certainly gone up. Number two, it would depend a lot on the risk profile of the asset. But then number three, what's always on our mind is our stock is currently trading at a look through cap rate of 9%. And that's got to be a guidance post as we think about putting out new capital. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler. Alexander Goldfarb : So Owen, along those lines, in prior cycles, you guys have bought some buildings 399, 510 Fed, you bought those in prior opportunistic times. But given the capital markets today, given Mike's comments about assessing the dividend if the disposition market doesn't open up. Are you guys more keen and confident to buy assets, let's say, around Park Avenue, Grand Central or other transit hubs? Or is the company's focus more on capital preservation and therefore only stick to the current pipeline and really limit incremental opportunistic existing asset purchases. Owen Thomas : Alex, we have access to capital, as Mike and I pointed out and the key is pricing. We're interested. We're open for business. We're interested in growing our company. We think we will. But that's at a 9% look through cap rate is a guidepost for us. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Nick Yulico : I appreciate all the commentary on the secured lending market. I guess a question I have is -- and again, I realize this doesn't really apply to your near-term maturity schedule. But now if we think about, let's say, New York City, this is a market that historically relied on very large loans that were put into the securitization CMBS market and it's not a single tenant, long-term credit building often. It's multi-tenant, the vintage of the asset will vary, but we're talking about $1 billion loans that got done for New York City, which seems like cannot get done right now because of what's going on with the securitization market. So I'm just trying to figure out what your thoughts are about the ability for this let's say, New York City as a market to function from a property sales standpoint, from a lending standpoint, if it is historically a market that has very large loans that can't get done in the securitization market right now. Douglas Linde : So this is Doug. I don't want to get into a conversation about other people's assets. So from our perspective, obviously, we don't have anything maturing anytime soon in our Manhattan portfolio. And we do have two large CMBS transactions that were done. There were SAS deals but they've got long duration associated with them. I would expect that the markets will heal and that there will be capital available at a different kind, as Mike described, a different kind of a leverage point and are a different kind of a pricing parameter. So there is going to be equity that's required in these assets to appropriately refinance them with a capital structure that makes sense for the large loan marketplace. And there's going to be, obviously, some degree of time before we get there. I mean there are obviously a lot of, I guess, sort of kick the cans or workouts or other conversations going on right now. But I believe with enough equity, you will be able to raise $1 billion financing in the market, but they're going to be done at different kind of leverage points. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck from Wells Fargo. Blaine Heck : Doug, your commentary around the most activ tenant groups in the market was really helpful. Can you guys just talk about how you're taking advantage of that activity amongst medium and small financial and professional services companies. Are you breaking down any of your vacant spaces into smaller spec suites or doing anything else to accommodate that demand from small tenants? Douglas Linde : So the answer is we are, and we are seeing, I would say, very deliberate about the kinds of things we're doing. I'll let Bob talk, for example, about some of the activities we have going on in San Francisco right now where what was put in front of me was a series of changes to some existing availability that we think will be very additive to the market. Bob, do you want to talk about our approach there? Robert Pester : Sure. We have a program of doing spec suites at Embarcadero Center on the smaller spaces, and we have several that are in the works right now. And some of them are designed where they can be combined with other suites that we need larger space. And typically, when we do these turnkey, we might have to put a little bit of TI in after the fact when we find a tenant. But we've had great success with these smaller suites so far. Douglas Linde : And Pete, maybe you can -- you or Ray can comment on the program we've had in Reston, Virginia for probably the last seven years and how successful that's been. Peter Otteni : Sure. So this is Pete Otteni from D.C. The -- yes, it was not too many years ago that the rest and town center market was not one where we had done spec suites very often, but in the intervening 24 to 48 months, we've done quite a few of those. I don't have the exact number off the top of my head. But it's in the high the number of -- the number of spec suites that we've done out there and all with great success, many leased prior to or at delivery. And then all of them that have been delivered are leased at this point, and we have activity on the balance of them. We did a full floor of spec suite at RTC Next in addition to the spec suites in the urban core Town Center. And it's been a very successful program out there, capitalizing on exactly this type of tenant that's being discussed. And obviously, we have done them in D.C. for many years. that's a little bit more of a competitive market, but we think in the right buildings, for instance, after some good success on the leasing front at 2100 Penn, we're likely to have some space left there where we think spec suites will be very, very sought after due to the quality of the building and the quality of the spec suites that we'll build there. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Caitlin Burrows : Maybe just another one on leasing. In the quarter, you did 660,000 square feet of leasing and have talked about now an expectation for about $750 million square feet per quarter the rest of the year. So I was just wondering, are you seeing activity that specifically points to an increase in leasing activity in 2Q and beyond? And if so, what and kind of where is that? Or is it more of a general expectation at this point? Douglas Linde : I think it's general expectation based upon SAC, right? So I went through our sort of pipeline, and I've got 900,000 square feet of active leases under negotiation I've got 1.65 million square feet of proposals that I believe will manifest themselves into a significant number of signed leases, and it's -- we're talking about being in April of 2023. So I've got another eight months ahead of me. So I feel very confident that we will be able to achieve a 3 million square foot leasing market I hope we're going to exceed it, but it's not based upon our projections. Our projections are 3 million square feet and that's where it was built into our occupancy numbers and Mike's same-store numbers. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Griffin from Citi. Michael Griffin : Maybe we just shift back to San Francisco, down the Peninsula probably better off submarket be curious to get your thoughts about Google announcing the pause on that mega campus in San Jose. Could you see this being a potential benefit for that Platform 16 project? I think it's not expected to be stabilized till 2026. I know you have a relationship with Google. So any comments you can make there would be helpful. Douglas Linde : Sure. Bob, do you want to take that one? Robert Pester : Sure. First off, the CNBC report that came out the other day that they were stopping the project is false news. It's been reported by the mayor on Friday and Google yesterday that they're still planning on proceeding with the project today -- or excuse me, this year. We do have a relationship with Google, whether or not they would have interest in that project remains to be seen. But we will be the first building out of the ground adjacent to their campus. So time will tell. They're several years away from actually starting a building because they've got to put all the infrastructure in place person. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Mizuho. Vikram Malhotra : Just two quick ones. So one, can you just remind us, are there any risks sort of with the -- I think you have three or four rework leases in terms of just their performance and potentially being those being given back. And then just separately, broadly, I know you had embarked on -- over time, you've been investing CapEx to kind of keep the buildings fresh. And I'm just wondering sort of in this environment, can you remind us sort of what the sort of CapEx outlay may look like over the, call it, the next 2 years to keep the buildings competitive? Robert Pester : Let me answer your second question first. So your second question on CapEx is that BXP typically spends somewhere between $2 and $2.50 a square foot per year on its overall, what I would refer to as ordinary course of business CapEx. And that is defined as base building and what I would say sort of modest refreshes on our portfolio. It doesn't include if we're going to build a new amend center at the General Motors building or we're going to do a new amenity center and a market or a center or we're going to totally got and redo 1 of our lobbies. So it doesn't include those types of expenses, which would be outside of that. With regard to WeWork, WeWork is client of ours, WeWork is clearly reducing the number of units that they have. We've negotiated some reductions from WeWork in our portfolio and WeWork is not likely to be in the same relative position in terms of the amount of space that they take from BXP when we get to the next quarter. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley. Ronald Kamdem : Just one quick one and a follow-up. Just on the asking the leasing question in a different way. So I thought the expectation before was for occupancy to potentially be down in the first quarter, first half. So it sounds like there was probably more leasing than expected. Maybe you could just comment on that. And I'd also love to hear sort of your comments on occupancy for the portfolio by market, specifically in the West Coast versus the East Coast. And a follow-up -- yes, the quick follow-up was just on -- there's been a lot of sort of news about Salesforce in the market subleasing space. And I'm wondering how you guys are thinking about that. for Salesforce Tower? And if any other tenants potentially could be subleasing space? Douglas Linde : Okay. So that's about 8 questions and I'll try and answer them really fast. So we lease 5.8 million square feet of space in 2022, and our expectations were for 3 million square feet in 2023, so a lot less. The first quarter, I think, was pretty consistent with what our expectations were for the year. So I don't think that there are any sort of changes on a relative basis. Regarding occupancy, we've been pretty consistent with where we've basically been saying we think occupancy is expected to go down a little bit in 2023. I think we didn't describe exactly when that's going to occur. There will be some reduction in occupancy likely in the second quarter because we have some expirations. And then the 1.2 million square meter space that I described that we expect to get in service in '23 is more towards the back end of the quarter or the back end of the year, so it will pick up again. But net-net, we think our occupancy will be relatively flat to modestly higher as we enter the end of 2023, early 2024. With regard to Salesforce Tower, Salesforce.com has space on the sublet market. We're not part of their conversations. They have not come to us and said, \"Hey, we have a tenant that would like to do a long-term lease? And would you consider doing a stub or would you consider taking the space back. So I'm not aware of what their specifically is going on with their sublet. But I can tell you that they're single location is likely to be at Salesforce Tower when they sort of get done with their \"subleasing the space\" because they've moved out of 350 Mission, and they have the majority of their space at 50 Fremont on the Sublomarket. And they obviously, they pulled out of the other buildings that were going to go up in that neighborhood. So the thing that's left is Salesforcetower.com. Owen Thomas : I would just add, we have -- Bob should comment on this. We have market inquiries relatively frequently for the Salesforce Tower, and it's completely full. And one of the reasons Salesforce is putting floors in the tower on the market is because it's actually the easiest space they have sublease given the attractiveness of the asset. Robert Pester : Yes. I would just add, the building is 100% leased. It's probably the most sought after building in San Francisco for space and we get multiple inquiries every month about people looking for space in the building. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Dylan Bazinsky from Green Street. Dylan Bazinsky : Just curious how you guys are thinking about buybacks or potential buybacks in the current environment. Owen, you mentioned the 9% implied cap rate that the stock now trades at today. And I realize that obviously, office transaction markets are fairly illiquid. But if you guys were able to get dispositions to the finish line, would you guys view buybacks the potential use of that capital? Owen Thomas : Well, we think that our stock represents a very uniquely interesting investment, particularly at this point in time. Most of the inquiries we've been getting recently, and that's the reason why Mike and I spent so much time on it in our remarks is our access to capital and how are we dealing with upcoming debt maturities and things like that. So in this kind of environment, buybacks are not a priority for us. And we also -- we have found interesting uses for the capital. We just put on our development pipeline this quarter. The 290 Binney Street development that's 100% leased to AstraZeneca and also the 300 Binney Street asset conversion. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Credit Suisse. Tayo Okusanya : Just a quick one on office to resi conversion. Again, a lot of these buildings don't compete with your assets. So just curious how you guys think about that for movement? Is it something that you're excited about? Do you think it helps BXP longer term? Or just because it's not competitive product doesn't really matter to you guys? Owen Thomas : No, I would say it this way. I think it's a very big trend that will unfold slowly. And the reason I think it's a very big trend is because I think virtually everyone benefits from it. There's too much out of -- there's too much obsolete office stock that something needs to happen with that stock. Number two, there is a shortage of housing in I think all the cities where we operate. Three, conversions would create more appraised value and more tax revenues for the cities that we operate in. And lastly, converting an existing building versus tearing it down and building something new creates much less embodied carbon. So I just think everything about conversion makes a ton of sense. The issue with it is -- and the reason I say it's going to unfold slowly is there are big challenges in doing it. First of all, building has to be empty, and there's not many office buildings that are fully empty, a lot of them are 50% empty or something like that. So that's number one. Number two, physical characteristics are very important, particularly the Bay depths in the property, access to light and air is very important for residential. So very large floor plate buildings they'll work as well. And then lastly, economics; most office buildings today are not appraised or valued at a level where a conversion is economic. But I think these forces will work themselves out over time. If you just take a very small percentage of the 733 million square feet of office in our markets and say it's converted, that's very material. And in terms of BXP, we don't have any assets that are conversion candidates themselves. But I do think it will represent an opportunity for us to do some residential development. And it's a little bit different from a typical conversion that I think you're asking me about, but this world gate investment, albeit small, that we just made is an example of us reusing a parking garage and taking a site that's currently an empty office building and converting it into something more productive. Douglas Linde : Yes. And this is Doug. I would just add that World Gate is sort of an illustrative example of what we think may happen in certain instances in certain cities where the buildings have no intrinsic value as a repositioned conversion, and therefore, the land is really where the value is, and it probably has a higher and better use as residential. And so there are buildings probably that will be taken down and the sites will be then readapted as residential sites even though they're currently commercial office buildings. Helen Han : Why don't we circle back to Hilary on 360 Park? Hilary? Hilary Spann : Thanks, Helen. Can you guys hear me now? Okay. It's Hilary Spann. I just wanted to add a little bit of color to the leasing activity in Midtown South at 360 in addition to what Doug has already described with regards to the pipeline that's either out for signature or in negotiation. Last quarter, I told everyone that we thought that we would be seeing more demand from 50,000 to 75,000 square foot tenants leading into this year, and that largely proved itself to be correct. We are currently in discussions with five tenants that range from 25,000 square feet to 75,000 square feet at the building. But I think what is more interesting, and this is really just sort of a check on the spot market for leasing in Midtown South is that recently, we have toured 2 150,000 square foot tenant and one 200,000 square foot tenant for 360 Park Avenue South. And we also toward just yesterday at Tenet that lumped to start at 30,000 square feet and potentially has growth to 100,000 square feet. So it seems that the demand profile is shifting a little bit again toward larger tenancy in the submarket. Obviously, that will take some time to play out as these tenants decide where they're going to go and document transactions. But I think overall, it's a positive signal for the market. And if I looked at all of that combined with what we're trading paper and the tours that are in the market, that represents about 715,000 square feet of tenants that are in the market right now. So just wanted to share that in additional detail with you. Operator : I'm showing no further questions in the queue. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Owen Thomas, CEO, for closing remarks. Owen Thomas : Just want to thank everyone for your time, attention and interest in BXP. That concludes the call. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for attending. You may all disconnect at this time",

I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks. Owen Thomas : Thank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover BXP's above-expected operating performance in the second quarter, key economic and market trends impacting BXP, BXP's capital allocation activities and a personnel and organizational announcement.  BXP continued to perform in the second quarter, once again demonstrating sentiment in the office industry is worse than what we are experiencing. Our FFO per share was above both market consensus and the midpoint of our own forecast. And once again, this quarter, we increased our FFO per share guidance for all of 2023. We completed 938,000 square feet of leasing in the second quarter with a weighted average lease term of 8 years despite continued challenging leasing market conditions. We completed multiple company and asset-specific financings, both elevating our liquidity position and demonstrating BXP's sustained access to the capital markets. U.S. economic growth is challenging to forecast as there are currently 2 competing and viable theories predicting very different trajectories. The first theory is that inflation is increasingly under control due to pandemic economic anomalies wearing off and Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. And the economy has and will remain healthy with a strong labor market and continued GDP growth driven by consumption. The second theory is that inflation is already well under control, and the Federal Reserve has been overly aggressive in the magnitude and timing of its interest rate increases, which will create dislocation in sectors of the economy as has already started to occur with regional banks and commercial real estate and will result in a recession possibly as soon as later this year.  We are obviously hoping for the first outcome but have prepared BXP for the second by increasing liquidity currently at $3.1 billion, pursuing additional capital raising opportunities and being measured in discretionary capital expenditures and new investment activity. Whether or not we have an economic recession, U.S. companies are experiencing a recession in earnings, which for the S&P 500 are predicted to drop over 6% year-over-year in the second quarter.  With lower earnings, companies look to cut costs, including expenditures for space, which is the primary driver of our slower leasing in the first half of 2023 versus last year. Large tech companies, the most significant source of new employment and net absorption of space last cycle, are largely absent from the current leasing market. In analyzing the market demand for office space, it is important to understand the behavior of underlying users, which, in the broadest sense, are bifurcated into two groups.  First, their knowledge workers who are client and/or product facing and execute the core functions of a business where creativity and collaboration are critical to success. And second, support workers who provide services to the core functions of a business in areas such as IT and accounting, where tasks are more repetitive and collaboration less of an imperative.  Knowledge workers generally have dedicated workstations and are increasingly in the office as business leaders understand the importance of in-person work for this group and are enforcing firmer in-person work policies. In many cases, companies working remotely are announcing return to office plans. Companies working on a hybrid basis are increasing the number of days expected in the office. Companies are tying year-end evaluations and bonus levels to office attendance.  On the other hand, support workers often work in shared workstations with more workers and seats, with much less prescriptive office attendance policies.  This workforce bifurcation is creating the ever-increasing performance gap between premier workplaces and the balance of the office market. A primary tool companies utilize to increase knowledge worker attendance is to provide modern workspace rich with amenities in an easily commutable location, the definition of a premier workplace.  Conversely, support functions are not as commonly located in premier workplace assets. Therefore, remote work and shared workstation puts more pressure on the market for lower-quality buildings in secondary locations. The divergent impact of AI on knowledge and support jobs could also continue to widen the building quality performance gap as AI drives knowledge job growth and automate support processes.  We share in our IR materials every quarter, CBRE's report on the performance of the premier Workplace segment. In the 5 CBDs where BXP operates, premier workplaces represent approximately 18% of the total space and 10% of the total buildings. At the end of the second quarter, direct vacancy for premier workplaces was 11.6% versus 16.5% for the balance of the market.  Also for the second quarter, net absorption for the premier segment was around 800,000 square feet positive versus a negative 2.1 million square feet for the balance of the market. For the last 10 quarters, net absorption for the premier segment was a positive 6.7 million square feet versus a negative 31.9 million square feet for the balance of the market.  Rents and rent growth are higher for premier workplaces, and we believe the segment captures most of all gross leasing activity. Including two buildings undergoing renovation, 94% of BXP CBD space is in buildings rated by CBRE as premier workplaces, which has been important in driving the increasing office attendance statistics in our buildings and is a critical differentiator for BXP in the marketplace.  Moving to private real estate capital markets, U.S. transaction volume in the second quarter rose 43% from the first quarter to $9.6 billion, though volume is down 50% versus the second quarter last year. Interestingly, sales volumes for other asset classes is weaker, up less than office and consecutive quarters and down more versus last year.  Real estate values have reset down due to higher capital costs and demand challenges in specific sectors, and most sellers continue to be unwilling to accept lower prices, creating a slowdown in transaction activity, common and declining markets. New mortgage financing for office is not available from domestic lenders. Non-U.S. banks will consider financing only for the highest quality leased assets and sponsors and at modest loan to values. Completed office sales and recapitalizations invariably involved buildings with long weighted average lease terms and/or seller financing.  Given the dearth of transaction activity, office asset pricing is difficult to determine, but there were a small number of relevant data points this past quarter. A fund manager backed by a private equity firm purchased two lab portfolios in the Boston area from a public REIT. Three buildings on Second Avenue and Waltham comprising 329,000 square feet, which are 100% leased for over 6 years, sold for $266 million, representing pricing of $809 a foot and a 5.8% initial cap rate.  Also in the deal, two buildings on Memorial Drive in Cambridge Port comprising 99,000 square feet and vacated for redevelopment sold for $99 million, which was a price of just under $1,000 a square foot. Also located in Santa Clara next to BXP's Peterson Way development site campus at 3333 sold for $183 million, representing pricing of $742 a square foot and a 6.1% initial cap rate.  The building comprises 246,000 square feet. It's fully leased on a long-term basis and was sold by a domestic pension fund to a domestic fund manager.  Now moving to BXP's capital market activity for the second quarter. We are being patient with new investment activity as we believe acquisition opportunities will grow in number and become more attractive in this environment. We will remain opportunistic and solely focused on premier workplaces, life science and residential development in our 6 target markets.  We are considering additional capital raising through dispositions and joint ventures with our in-service residential assets and select pre-leased developments. This quarter, we placed fully into service 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue, a 476,000 square-foot market-leading premier workplace in Washington, D.C. that is 91% leased.  In late June, we opened and placed into service View Boston, a 3-story observation Pavilion, a top Prudential tower in the Back Bay of Boston that offers panoramic views of the city as well as an immersive experience, showcasing Boston's many neighborhoods and cultural landmarks. BXP has been constructing the first phase of the Platform 16 premier workplace development adjacent to Google's Downtown West project in San Jose.  BXP owns a 55% interest in the project in the first phase includes a 390,000 square foot building as well as a garage and foundation for all three phases, which in total will comprise 1.1 million square feet. Unfortunately, market conditions in the Silicon Valley, including San Jose, have deteriorated meaningfully with rising direct vacancy, few large space requirements and technology companies, including Google, putting significant space in the sublease market.  As a result, we have decided to pause construction of the project at with completion of the Garage and Foundation scheduled for year-end 2023. Though disappointing, as market conditions recover, we will have a project that can be delivered to users in under two years, which is 12 to 14 months more quickly than a ground-up development.  Further, this decision reduces our near-term development spend by approximately $200 million, thereby enhancing our liquidity. BXP recently accomplished two important milestones in the predevelopment of the 900,000 square foot 343 Madison premier workplace in Midtown Manhattan. We completed a joint venture with a leading global real estate investor who will own a 45% interest in the project.  Further, the joint venture completed a 99-year ground lease with the Metropolitan Transit Authority for the 343 Madison Avenue site. Under the terms of the lease, the joint venture is required to construct a direct entrance into the Long Island Railroad East Side Access project known as Grand Central Madison.  The joint venture can terminate the ground lease and be reimbursed for its costs in constructing the access to Grand Central Madison. With direct access to transit in the relatively tight Grand Central submarket, 343 Madison is a unique offering and preliminary discussions with potential anchor clients have been constructive. BXP continues to execute a significant development pipeline with 13 office, lab, retail and residential projects underway. These projects aggregate approximately 3.1 million square feet and $2.6 billion of BXP investment with $1.6 billion remaining to be funded and are projected to generate attractive yields upon delivery.  On a personnel matter, after a 25-year distinguished career running BXP, San Francisco region, Bob Pester has elected to retire early next year. We have asked Rod Diehl, who currently runs leasing in BXP San Francisco region to succeed Bob. Rod, an 18-year BXP veteran is an accomplished leader with a strong track record of commercial success with BXP's clients. With this change, we are also adjusting our organizational structure.  BXP has and will continue to execute its business in three regions on the West Coast. However, given that L.A. and Seattle are relatively new regions for BXP and currently underscaled, we will manage these three regions with a unified organizational structure under Rod sharing resources across the regions to the benefit of BXP's clients and shareholders.  Alex Cameron and Melissa Cohen will continue to be our senior representatives in the L.A. region and Kelley Lovshin, our senior representative in the Seattle region.  So in summary, despite strong negative market sentiment, BXP had another productive quarter with financial performance and leasing above expectations and a stable dividend. BXP is well positioned to weather the current economic slowdown given our leadership position in the premier workplace market segment, our strong and liquid balance sheet with access to multiple capital sources, our significant development pipeline providing growth and our potential to gain market share in both assets and clients due to the current market dislocation. Let me turn it over to Doug. Douglas Linde : Thanks, Owen. So during our June NAREIT meetings, the most frequent topic of conversation was our leasing activity since it obviously drives occupancy, top line revenue on our net operating income. So I'm going to focus my remarks here this morning. Owen highlighted the volume of signed leases during the second quarter.  Just to remind everybody, during the last 9 months, we've been providing the leasing expectations embedded into our 2023 earnings guidance between 0.5 million and 1 million square feet per quarter which translates to 750,000 square feet on average or 3 million square feet for year 2023.  So during the first quarter, we signed 660. As of the end of the first half of '23, we've completed 1.56 million square feet, pretty much on target. This quarter, the 930,000 square feet of time leases included 63 transactions, 37 renewals, 26 new tenants. There were 7 contractions and 5 expansions. Three of the expansions were law firms, although we also had two law firm contractions along with the nonprofit and a government agency.  Breaking the volume down by market, 320,000 square feet in Boston, 280,000 square feet in New York, 235,000 square feet in D.C. and a 100,000 square feet in San Francisco. We ended the second quarter with an in-service occupancy of 88.3% compared to 88.6% last quarter. But as Owen said, we added 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue to the in-service portfolio.  The building is 91% leased but only 61% occupied for purposes of revenue recognition, which is how we calculate our occupancy statistics. So if you exclude the additional property, our occupancy actually remains flat for that quarter. As we sit here today, we have signed leases that have yet to commence on our in-service vacancy, totaling approximately 1 million square feet with 800,000 square feet anticipated to commence in 2023. That does not include the development portfolio, which is 3.1 million square feet and 54% leased.  We currently have 44 leases in negotiation totaling 1.17 million square feet as compared to about 900,000 square feet as we entered the second quarter, so a slight acceleration. The one difference in this pool of transactions is that there is one large renewal, over 300,000 square feet versus the largest active negotiation last quarter also renewal was just over 100,000 square feet.  We also have a current pipeline of additional active proposals totaling over 1.7 million square feet. So if we complete 95% of the leases in negotiation and 1/3 of the 1.7 million square feet of proposals. We currently would have about 1.7 million square feet of additional leases we hope to execute during the second half of '23, which will bring our total leasing for 2023 to just over 3 million square feet, again, going back to our original embedded expectations right on target.  Our remaining 2023 expiration are 1.3 million square feet. We have 800,000 square feet of signed leases with an anticipated 2023 commencement. We'll be delivering 140 Kendrick Street, 104,000 square feet into the in-service portfolio in the third quarter and 751 Gateway, 100% leased 231,000 square feet in the fourth quarter. We will have additional 2023 activity across the portfolio, which will get our occupancy up slightly by year-end.  But as we get further into calendar year 2023, additional lease executions will impact occupancy after 2023. The New York regions, second-generation leasing statistics jump out this quarter and need a little bit of explanation. The deals commencing included a floor that was previously leased to an existing tenant at a below-market rent as they were rebuilding their space elsewhere in the building.  We subsequently relet the space under a long-term lease to a new tenant and the impact is hitting this quarter. If you strip out that transaction, New York would be down 9.2% on a gross basis and 15% on a net basis. As I said before, in general, we continue to have roll-ups in Boston and San Francisco, roll downs in D.C. and Northern Virginia, while New York is very building and lease-specific.  The leases we signed in this quarter on second-generation space were up 8% in Boston, 10% in San Francisco, down 11% in New York and down 13.5% in D.C. The New York leases signed this quarter included a 120,000 square foot renewal in Princeton that was down 28% on a cash basis. The sentiment of our own office is worse than the reality, as Owen said. To illustrate the point in our portfolio, we continue to see an incremental pickup in daily activity as we look at the month-to-month trend lines.  We measure the unique client employees coming into our building every day against a number of workstation/office desks in our CBD buildings today. Using this methodology, we are seeing weekly usage of 80% in New York City, 75% in Boston and 70% in San Francisco, and this excludes Salesforce.com and WeWork because they don't use our access card system.  When we look at individual firms, there is a wide discrepancy in utilization. We have clients that are close to 90% of their daily high that they had pre-pandemic. While we have a few insurance companies back office that are as low as 35% sort of making Owen's point on the type of work that's being done. The frequency at work in the office is about three days per week across our markets where we track the data, and this includes San Francisco. So that people are coming back to work, 3-plus days a week.  Fridays continues to be a real outlier for our clients. Contrary to popular sentiment our clients are using their space. From a broad perspective, the office supply picture didn't improve in the second quarter. The third-party industry reports all noted negative modest absorption across all of the major markets in the United States, all of them. And you'll clearly read about high headline availability very scintillating in every market for -- in the U.S. for some time. However, continuing the theme that the sentiment is worse in the reality, the New York City brokers reports also indicate that the Class A inventory in the Park Avenue submarket has an availability rate of 11% and that net effective rents are rising with higher face rates and flat or lower concessions. And while it's not reported, the availability in the premier buildings is even tighter.  Away from the Midtown market in the BXP portfolio, we are now in negotiations with our first multi-floor client at 360 Park Avenue South. Tenant demand in the San Francisco CBD has increased more than 50% since the fourth quarter of 2022, with new technology demand responsible for much of the increase. There are a significant number of AI companies actively considering space and the requirements will all create net absorption. Given their potential growth at these organizations, we would expect this demand to center on the well-built tech sublet space that is readily available in the market, not direct vacancy. Global investment in the AI field is rapidly increasing and it's going to result in job growth.  San Francisco is the leading labor market for AI jobs, followed by Seattle and New York and new venture capital investment in AI is concentrated in San Francisco CBD, New York and Boston, with CBRE research reporting at San Francisco is receiving more than 50% of the total invested money during the third quarter. These are encouraging facts that can only be constructive in the eventual recovery of the San Francisco CBD office market.  The concentration of user demand strength with growth still is broadly speaking, alternative asset managers, private equity, venture, hedge funds, specialized fund managers. These companies are growing their teams and capital under management. This pool of clients typically wants to occupy premier workplaces. To illustrate this point, during the quarter, we did a multi-floor 10-year renewal with our private equity firm in Boston and a 15-year renewal for a full floor with an investment manager in New York City.  In general, our strongest activity as at the General Motors Building in Manhattan, 200 [indiscernible] in the Prudential Center properties in Boston, 2200 and 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue in D.C., the urban core of Reston Town Center in Northern Virginia and our Embarcadero Center assets in San Francisco. We don't have availability of Salesforce Tower ourselves directly. The loss firms are also active in our portfolio and important clients for BXP. This quarter, we completed three law firm leases in New York, one in Boston and three in our D.C. portfolio. We also have a number of active loss from transactions in the proposal stage at Embarcadero Center. In general, however, outside of Manhattan, the law firms are reducing their footprint. During the quarter, we completed three life science leases, a 55,000 square foot extension in Lexington, Massachusetts. We relet the 12,000 square foot suite at 880 Winter Street where we had a pharma biotech company shut down its operations in March. We did it on an as-is basis and the rent that was 9% higher than the prior rent. And we completed our second full floor lease at 651 Gateway in South San Francisco.  We are also negotiating a third full for lease at 651 Gateway, and we intend to complete a speculative turnkey installation on an additional floor. The property will open in '24 and to date, each lease at 651 Gateway requires our partnership to complete turnkey build-outs.  Activity in the life science market continues to be moderate across both Boston and South San Francisco, and there is new unleased supply being added to the market. There are a few large requirements that are touring. But as I have previously said, the bulk of the demand is from small private companies that are looking for fully built space. Our new client at 80 Winter fits this profile. I also want to note that we are seeing costs decreasing this inflation on our tenant improvement work relative to jobs completed in 2022, largely due to the falloff in transactions in our markets. The numbers are slightly different by market by market, but we are seeing a reduction in TIs that we are budgeting.  BXP's portfolio is going to gain occupancy. We will continue to lease available space because our portfolio is fundamentally comprised of premier workplaces. The majority of the demand new and existing clients in the market wants to be in these types of properties and we are investing capital in our building infrastructure, amenities and tenant spaces. We are all seeing the stress that many buildings are feeling due to their current capital structure. The transition or recapitalization of these buildings is going to take an extended time. While this is happening, many of these assets are not in a position to commit capital to existing or new tenants, which greatly impacts the leasing brokers interest in considering them for their clients.  And so returning to the theme of the sentiment is worse than the reality for BXP, much of the available space in our markets is not competitive with our assets and some buildings are not in a position to compete due to their owners unwillingness to invest capital while their capitalization is in the restructure mode.  Our clients are using our space. Medium and small financial and professional service clients will make up the bulk of the leasing we completed in 2023. We completed 57 leases during the first quarter, 63 during the second. We have had only two leases above 100,000 square feet this year and each was a renewal. Occupancy gains will be captured slowly through lots of small- and medium-sized new leases and renewals. I'll stop here and turn the call over to Mike. Michael LaBelle : Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. I'm going to start with a few comments on our balance sheet and then I plan to cover the details of our second quarter performance and the changes to our 2023 earnings guidance. We had a busy quarter in the debt markets, and we continue to bolster our liquidity and opportunistically manage our interest rate risk. In the bond market, we issued $750 million of 6.5% 10-year unsecured green bonds. We had strong support from our fixed income investors and our deal was well oversubscribed, allowing us to upsize the transaction and reduce the pricing from initial guidance. When we issued the notes in May, the underlying treasury was 3.34% and our credit spread was 320 basis points.  Our credit spreads have rallied significantly to under 250 basis points today, while the 10-year has increased to over 4%. So despite all the volatility, if we issued another 10-year today, it would be at a similar coupon. In the mortgage market, we refinanced our $105 million expiring mortgage on 500 North Capitol Street in Washington, D.C. We also exercised 1-year extensions for our mortgage loans on the Marriott headquarters in Bethesda and the Hub on Causeway office tower in Boston. Our remaining 2023 loan maturities are limited to a $500 million bond maturity that we expect to repay with cash as well as a mortgage loan on our mixed-use Hub on Causeway podium building.  The Hub on Causeway is held in a joint venture and our share of the loan is only $87 million. We're finalizing terms and expect to refinance the loan in the third quarter for two additional years plus a 1-year extension option. This quarter, we also entered into interest rate swaps to fix the rate on our $1.2 billion unsecured term loan through May of 2024. We fixed the term SOFR rate at 4.64%. That's approximately 70 basis points lower than where term SOFR sits today.  Our liquidity is strong at $3.1 billion. It consists of $1.6 billion in cash and the full availability under our $1.5 billion line credit. Our liquidity needs through the end of 2024 include $1.1 billion of projected spend on our development pipeline, $1.2 billion of bond maturities and $190 million of mortgages with final maturities by 2024.  We do have another $390 million of mortgages and our $1.2 billion term loan that mature in 2024 and have extension rights into 2025 or 2026. So our financing plan is to pay off the $500 million bond expiring in September with cash. Refinance our $700 million bond prior to its maturity in February 2024, either through the secured or the unsecured market, refinance our mortgage maturities and continue to maintain ample liquidity.  Now turning to our earnings results. For the second quarter, we reported funds from operations of $1.86 per share. Our results exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.06 per share. The outperformance was due to $0.02 of better-than-expected revenues in the portfolio, combined with $0.04 of lower-than-expected operating expenses.  The stronger revenues were spread across the portfolio. It included earlier than projected lease commencements, higher service and parking revenues and outperformance at our hotel. On the operating expense side of the ledger, the savings were split between lower energy costs from both lower consumption and rates and the deferral of repair and maintenance expenses.  We project that most of the benefit from lower maintenance expenses will be lost as the projects get deferred until later in the year. So for the full year 2023, we're raising our FFO guidance to $7.24 to $7.29 per share. In our same-property portfolio, we expect most of the second quarter performance to flow through to the full year.  We're raising our assumptions for our same-property NOI growth by increasing the bottom end of our range by 50 basis points. So we're now assuming same-property NOI growth from 2022 of 0% to 0.5%. We're also increasing our assumption for same-property cash NOI growth to 1.5% to 2.5%.  The other area we are seeing improvement is in net interest expense. By swapping the floating rate on our $1.2 billion term loan to a fixed rate we've locked in interest savings. And while we issued new bonds to refinance our September maturity earlier than we had projected, the interest rate was lower than our assumption from last quarter, plus we're seeing better deposit rates and are carrying higher cash balances, so we are earning more on our liquidity. In conclusion, we're increasing our 2023 FFO guidance range by $0.10 per share at the midpoint. The changes are primarily from $0.05 per share of better same-property portfolio NOI and $0.05 per share of lower net interest expense. Overall, we had a strong quarter with top line revenue growth, earnings outperformance, improved leasing volumes positive mark-to-market on our commenced leases and timely capital raising activity. Our balance sheet is in excellent shape, and we are well positioned in an uncertain environment for any economic outcome.  Looking further forward, we do expect the high interest rate environment to continue to be a headwind as we refinance low-cost expiring debt at anticipated higher rates. For example, we have a $700 million of 3.8% fixed rate unsecured notes that expire in early 2024, and we expect a refinancing rate of approximately 6.5%. In addition, we have $1.9 billion of floating rate debt that is impacted by changes in SOFR rates.  Our floating rate debt does include our $1.2 billion term loan that has been swapped to a fixed rate through May of 2024. We expect that our same property portfolio to be stable, with occupancy improving over time, and we will continue to add to our income through placing developments into service over the next few years. That completes all of our formal remarks. Operator, can you open up the lines for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. So our first question comes from the line of John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : I think I'll try to ask a multipart question on 343 Madison. Any additional commentary you could provide on the total costs of both the site access and the building itself, development yields that you expect, who the partner is or at least what regions they're in? And what level of pre-leasing you need to move forward for the project? Douglas Linde : So let me answer the first three parts of your question, and then we'll let Hilary answer the fourth. So we're designing the building. The building hasn't been designed yet. We are not in a position to discuss the economics of the development or the returns. Clearly, the capital markets are different than they were, so the return thresholds necessary to rationalize putting capital into building are going to be higher than they would have been in 2019 or 2020. I will let Hilary talk about the demand side. Hilary Spann : Thanks, Doug. The demand side for this building has been interesting in the sense that, as Doug pointed out, the building is still being designed and yet we're receiving inbound calls from clients who are interested in anchoring the development even in spite of the fact that it would take several years to build the building. This has to do, as Owen mentioned, with the tightness in the Park Avenue district and the Plaza submarket more generally in the sense that there's very little Class A premier workplace available for folks to occupy and as businesses are expanding in that district, they're finding themselves boxed out of larger space options. And so I would say, particularly given the fact that we have not had a very active marketing program in place for 343, the interest in the building has been very, very robust with multiple clients ranging from call it, 200,000 to 300,000 square feet seeking information on the building. Owen Thomas : And John, it's Owen. And lastly, we are honoring our partner's request for confidentiality. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Griffin from Citi. Michael Griffin : Owen, I appreciate your comments kind of about the transaction activity and potential acquisition opportunities out there. I was wondering if you could give some color on kind of what the IRRs on those potential opportunities could be and kind of how you weigh that relative to maybe potential share buybacks. Owen Thomas : Well, Michael, I think on IRRs, as I mentioned in my remarks, there's just not very many deals out there that are happening. I mean, on this call, every quarter, I try to give a spectrum of the deals that got completed. And frankly, it's really hard to find things right now. So look, I think in the premier workplace segment, overall, the IRRs where transactions were occurring before interest rates went up was probably in the 6s and today, even though there's not many data points given the capital is more expensive. They've clearly gone up 100 basis points or more, I would say. But again, that's conjecture. As it relates to buybacks, as we have been saying, we think our stock represents a tremendous value opportunity. But we also have uses for the capital, our development pipeline and opportunities that may present themselves. And so we have elected not to pursue a buyback program at this time. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck from Wells Fargo. Blaine Heck : Owen, I think you mentioned considering capital raising through dispositions and joint ventures. Can you just expand on whether the dispositions would be concentrated in noncore assets or higher quality properties. Then on the JV side, can you give some color on what potential investors are looking for in an ideal investment? And what sort of returns they're targeting in this environment given those high capital costs that you just referenced? Owen Thomas : Well, I mentioned in my remarks that we're looking at dispositions and joint ventures with our residential assets and also our leased development properties. And I think those two asset categories would probably represent the least impacted in our portfolio in terms of increasing cost of capital and cap rates. So I think the residential asset segment today is more liquid than office. There are no premier workplaces selling, but it's certainly more liquid in office. So we're going to evaluate those opportunities. And we're also evaluating opportunities in our leased development pipeline. Douglas Linde : And Blaine, I would just make the following sort of analytic comment. And the IRR is dependent upon, obviously, what the cash flow looks like, but they're still very dependent upon what your expectations are for the future. And so we are not smart enough to be able to read the minds of our potential partners and how they're thinking about what they view as the capitalization rates in 10 years, 8 years, 15 years and how much growth they're viewing is going to be in the underlying rents of the buildings that we might be offering to them. So it's really hard to sort of get into their minds. As Owen said, it's a lot higher than it was in 2019. But we don't know if it's higher because they've lowered their expectations for those residual cap rates, they've lowered their growth rates on their rents or some combination. But it's not an easy question to answer. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Stephen Sakwa : I wanted to just maybe circle up on Platform 16. And Owen, I realize you've kind of gone through this before with 250 West 55th in the past. But does the building have maybe other uses if office for that building just doesn't come back in the near term? Can you switch to residential? Or I guess, how long are you prepared to hold this? Douglas Linde : So Steve, this is Doug. So the answer at the moment is we haven't focused on not building the project that we currently have. And the project we currently have is three commercial premier workplace buildings. Clearly, we have a platform in a parking structure that is going to be able to hold three large suburban office buildings on it. So the platform would allow for something other than that. But at this point, we believe in the location, we believe in the rationalization of transportation through the Caltrain, which is why we easily picked this location in the first place. We believe in what eventually the user who owns most of the land around there will build. And so we're not pushing towards doing something different at this moment. But fundamentally, we looked at the market and said, 2024 is pretty quickly coming and owning a building that's going to deliver in that marketplace probably given the availability of other buildings around there is not going to be the best use of our capital today. So we're just going to hold off and let the market recover some more and deliver at the appropriate time. And that's the fundamentally the decision that we made today. Rod or Bob, I don't know if you'd like to add into that. Rodney Diehl : Yes, I don't have anything to add at this point. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith from UBS. Michael Goldsmith : We recognize one of the key tenets of the BXP investment case is this long development pipeline. And so now you're pausing this one building. Like how should we think about or what is your confidence level in the expected yields of some of your future projects? Are they at risk of also being delayed? And just your overall thoughts about when your development pipeline can be monetized and whether that is in the near term or kind of on the shelf for now. Owen Thomas : Yes. So -- it's Owen. Most of the balance of what we have is leased. So the big projects are the ones that we have in East Cambridge and one is fully leased faster. The other is fully leased by road. 360 Park Avenue South and other one, we're actually having some very constructive dialogues on that property and have a letter of intent with a client for part of the building. So I think the Platform 16 was rather unique circumstances given the amount of sublease space that's been put on the market in the Silicon Valley/San Jose area made us feel that -- and it was a completely speculative project with no pre-leasing. That brought us to the decision that Doug described. Douglas Linde : And again, everything that we currently have on that development pipeline that is not yet leased is almost finished. So there is no such thing as a delay of these projects. Relative to our future development, I mean, again, 343 Madison is future development. And as I said, where our return expectations is higher than it would have been in 2019 or 2020. So if we -- if and when we start those buildings, we would hope that we're going to have an economic opportunity to achieve the kind of returns that are necessary to rationalize an incremental amount of capital going into those new assets. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Caitlin Burrows : I think you mentioned earlier about how the top question at NAREIT was on leasing because that's so relevant to your company. So following up on that, in leasing velocity was up significantly in the quarter, but down year-over-year. I guess it can be volatile. So what are your conversations like now? And do you expect that pace of signings from 2Q can be maintained or like the pickup that you saw in the second quarter? Was there something in particular that drove that? Or could it be continued? . Douglas Linde : Yes. So welcome back, Caitlin. So the -- when we had our call during the first quarter, we had about 900,000 square feet of what I referred to as our leases in negotiation. And so as we enter the third quarter, that number was over 1.1 million square feet. So I'd say, as I said, a modest acceleration in that.  And we are comfortable with our embedded expectations of somewhere just over 3 million square feet for the year. So I would say quarter to quarter to quarter, it's going to be really what we anticipated. And I'm guessing the third quarter will be slightly better than the second quarter and the fourth quarter will depend upon how many early renewal conversations occur for 2024, 2025 lease expirations because again, as we get closer and closer to the end of the year, the leasing activity is generated from those types of conversations with our clients.  So we're constructive. I mean, as Owen said, the tech demand particularly on the West Coast, has not really started to materialize. And so -- and that was a big volume generator for all of the companies that are in our product mix. We don't anticipate that changing in 2023, probably not in 2024. So our comparisons to the prior years, we think, will be muted because as Owen said, we are -- we believe we are in an office recession relative to our clients.  And so there's not likely to be a massive acceleration in leasing activity. Again, we're going to capture market share because of our asset quality and our teams and their propensity to be creative about figuring out how to solve client problems, which will add to our occupancy, but the general market is not going to be what it was in 2022. Bryan Koop : Doug, one additional comment on the activity is that we are seeing a tremendous increase in the amount of not only access but time that we're spending directly with clients. And most of them are focusing on what is the workplace strategy for them going forward. And we're even seeing title changes where you have Director of Workplace strategy versus facilities people.  And these conversations are increasing weekly, and it has to do with the whole strategy and specifically on what premier workspace is going to be needed versus the other bifurcation in the space that they had that you mentioned earlier. So I think there's going to be an activity jump here in the future that's coming because it's been pent up because people have been kicking the can. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler. Alexander Goldfarb : First, Bob, congrats on your retirement or I don't know if we're allowed to use word retirement, maybe going to part time, but congrats there. So question for you, just continuing on the West Coast theme. What do you guys need to see to happen? Like what's going on with the tech companies? If we think back to the credit crisis like here in New York, Wall Street was down and out for quite a long time. It took many, many years before it came back. For the tech companies, is it they overhired. They're not sure what's going on with work from home. I mean they certainly seem to be profitable. they always come up with new innovations that they seem to need to hire and need space for. So what is -- what are the things that you need to see for the tech industry on the West Coast to sort of reengage proactively on the office front. Owen Thomas : I think Alex, I'll take a shot at that. I'd say, first of all, the tech companies trajectory of income growth has flattened out. So I think there's more focus on cost, which has an impact on space demand. And as new technologies are created and the advertising cycle changes and the growth continues, then I think there'll be more space demand. I think that's part of it. I think there definitely could have been an overinvestment period where there were lots of employees hired and also space that was taken in anticipation of growth that hasn't materialized. So I think there's a digestion aspect of this.  And lastly, I think the technology companies as well as the Federal government, by the way, have been behind the rest of corporate America in return to office. And I think as those policies are rolled out with the tech companies. And we're seeing it happen. Amazon came back to the office on May 1. There are other technology companies that have come back to the office. Others are suggesting things like I said in my remarks, about evaluating performance and paying people based on their office attendance. These policies are rolling out now, and I think that will also increase the demand for space. And it's going to take some time.  Doug, Rod, anybody else have other views on this? Rodney Diehl : This is Rod. I'll just comment real quickly. Alex, I just would add, and I think both Owen and Doug addressed this point, which is one of the positive tech drivers now that we're seeing is the AI demand. It's real. We've seen those deals in the market, a few of them have gotten signed, and it's not still by any stretch the majority of deals in the market, but it's happening. So it's that opportunity of a new technology that has pulled us out of other downturns. And so this is getting a lot of attention, and I think rightfully so. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Nicholas Yulico : I just want to follow up on all the commentary, Doug, you gave on leasing and the pipeline and activity. Just wanted to make sure we're clear on this. So if we look at your lease rate, it was down year-to-date about 100 basis points. Are you suggesting that in the back half of the year based on the visibility you have right now is actually going to be improvement in the lease rate? And then second part of that is you also mentioned in numerous times occupancy gains for the portfolio. And so I just want to be clear that are you saying that occupancy this year is going to be at a bottom. And at this point, you think next year is actually a growing occupancy year for the portfolio? Douglas Linde : So I'll answer the second question first. Yes, it's going to be modest, but it's yes. I'm not sure what you mean by lease rate. If you're talking about the amount of leasing that we are doing on a quarter-by-quarter basis compared to the previous years, it's going to be down for every quarter in 2023 relative to 2022. And that's why we -- I mean, again, we did build-to-suits in 2022 that we're not doing in 2023, including almost 1 million square feet just in Cambridge with AstraZeneca and the .  So again, the -- we're doing a lot more leases in terms of numerical number of transactions, but the check size is obviously smaller because of the nature of what the demand is coming from and which is small professional services and law firms and the financial services firms that I described before. So I -- we feel good about our pipeline of activity on a relative basis, first quarter, second quarter to third quarter to fourth quarter of 2023. And again, it's going to be within the construct of the embedded earnings projections that we provided, which is somewhere in the neighborhood of 3-plus million square feet space. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Mizuho. Vikram Malhotra : So just maybe building on uses of capital, you talked about the balance sheet. Your ability to fund what you have so far. But I'm just wondering, stepping back given what we know about the transaction market or [indiscernible]. Today, how do you view sort of your implied value given the run-up in office or the little run-up in office, we've seen relative to perceived NAV. And related to that, just uses of capital is the premier workspace trend is sustainable over, say, a 5, 7, 10 year period, is this a unique opportunity for you to do something more strategic in the premier space. Owen Thomas : So Vikram, I'll answer it this way. NAVs are hard -- they're based on a lot of judgments that Doug talked about earlier, which are what is your assumption on rent growth and residual cap rate and all these things. So I think the simplest way to think about it is what is the -- what does BXP's look through cap rates. And today, that is around 8.25%. I did highlight one premier workplace that sold in the Silicon Valley and its cap rate was 6.1%. I can't tell you what the proper look-through cap rate is for BXP's assets, but I don't think it's 8.25%. And so I think that it does represent significant value. Look, I think we are always going to be interested in looking at expanding in the premier workplace segment in the Life Science segment and in the residential development segment. And that's one of the reasons why we have the liquidity that we have, and we're so focused on our balance sheet because we want to have capital available during this time -- available to make these kinds of investments. And we're going to stay actively involved in our markets, looking for them. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Camille Bonnel from Bank of America. Camille Bonnel : You've had a lot of leasing activity over the past year in your Boston CBD portfolio, which is well leased. So could you speak to how tenant demand is trending for your suburban markets? And more generally, any comments on how your leasing pipeline breaks down between life sciences and more traditional office users would be great. Douglas Linde : So with regards to the Boston suburban market, depending upon how you define things, we have Cambridge, which is where the bulk of our value is and we have no available space there either, including the new developments that we're doing, which are 100 facilities. And then we have this group of assets that were once the sort of the perfect solution for a growing technology company on 128, which was called Technologies Highway that were created in the '80s, '90s, 2000.  And those locations are fabulous locations still and what we have been doing over time as we've been converting some of those buildings from office locations to life science locations. And so if you look at our development pipeline, the bulk of our available opportunity set is in Waltham, Massachusetts. It's in life science. And that is, I'd say, our focus for growth because we see more likely growth over time with life science demand in the greater Boston market than we necessarily do with traditional technology office demand. It doesn't mean there isn't demand out there because we are actually doing leases, both renewals and new deals in the Greater Waltham, Lexington market on the office side.  But I will tell you that in general, the suburban Boston office demand market is slower than the CBD market by a material amount right now. And so we are well positioned to capture incremental demand as the life science market recovers. And as we've said, time and time again. We're not going to simply build for the sake of building. We're going to wait for the demand to come to us and for the market to tighten to the point where it makes economic sense to do this, and we have such a low basis in these buildings because we have effectively free land or buildings that were purchased for $150 or $250 a square foot, where we can rationalize incremental investment and get a strong return when the market is a \"stable\" market from a life science perspective.  So I would say that the demand in general for traditional office space in the greater Boston suburban market is light. But it's -- there is some there, and we are capturing it because we happen to have the best -- absolutely the best properties in the best locations in what Bryan has sort of turned our urban edge locations. It's no longer viewed as suburban. And Bryan, I don't know if you want to make any additional comments? Bryan Koop : Yes. Two early things that I could point to this may lead to a trend is we have already completed one transaction with a downtown tenant, who has put a spoke into the urban age in one of our assets. We're talking to two more about that strategy, which gets back to this workplace strategy in the future for these companies that are really focused on their knowledge workers.  And then we're seeing, let's say, early trend, Doug, in what some people are calling Top Tech, which is some portion of the space needs bigger clear heights for work benches, et cetera, maybe it's displays for sales, but that use has picked up over the last 6 months for certain. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley. Ronald Kamdem : Just staying on the life science theme, we've sort of heard about sort of funding a lot of these smaller companies having to come back for funding and could impact what you think. So we just -- would love to hear just both on the demand side, what your expectations are in terms of activity over the next 12 to 24? How you guys are thinking about it? And then also hear your thoughts on the supply side. I mean I think a lot of the brokers have a lot of supply in the pipeline. Maybe if you could talk about what you're seeing and which is competitive to your portfolio. Douglas Linde : So I'm going to try and truncate the -- my answer to this. I'm not going to talk about all the things that and [indiscernible] talk about on their calls relative to sort of overall large-scale demand in life science and particularly biotech relative to gene therapy and all sorts of new discoveries that are going on. If you simply look at where the money is going and where it was, the amount of capital that was put into the life science market from a VC perspective had an enormous spike in 2019, '20 and '21, and it was way outsized.  And if you look at what's going on in 2023, it's pretty normalized and slightly higher than where it was in, call it, 2014 to 2019. And so I would say that there is lots of available capital, but the capital is being very thoughtful, and it's taking advantage, quite frankly, of dramatic drops in valuations for companies that were funded by people who probably shouldn't have given them capital and gave it to the valuations that were not appropriate for whatever the discovery was in the stage of those businesses. So we believe -- and we believe we will see this, what I refer to as sort of small life science demand continue in the marketplace, the issue is that there are not a lot of big demand drivers other than some 1 or 2 consolidations that are occurring with some pharma companies that have acquired some medicinal biotech companies over the last few years and are starting to put those requirements together in both South Francisco and in the greater Boston marketplace.  But you hit on the sort of the issue, which is there's more supply. And when that money was going into the sector, lots and lots of people who had property said, \"Aha. This is the perfect way for me to solve the problem of lack of demand in the office side. I'm going to take this building and convert it or I'm going to take this land and build a new building.\"  And we're going to have to deal with the rather a large amount of supply that's going to be in the marketplace for the next couple of years. And it is clear that there are winner locations and there are loser locations, and these ecosystems matter a lot.  And so we think that we are really well positioned with our particular assets in terms of their locations both in South San Francisco at 651 Gateway as well as the two Waltham properties that we have under development on the Totten Pond Road interchange which is where the sort of cluster of the larger life science requirements have gone to over the past 3 or 4 years.  And so we believe we'll lease these things up. Are the economics going to be what we had hoped, they're not. And I said this before, we're going to have to do more turnkey installations for these companies as supposed to give them an allowance and then putting their own money in. But we will deal with that. And we have the capital to do that, which again, many of I believe, are competitors with product may or may not have the desire or the capability of doing.  So we're going to get these buildings leased as the demand comes. The demand is going to get better, not worse. And we just -- it's going to take a little bit of time. I can't give you a projection of whether it's 12 or 24 months, but that's the way we're thinking about it. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Dylan Burzinski from Green Street. Dylan Burzinski : I guess just looking at BXP's portfolio in terms of office concentration, are there certain markets where you see you guys sell adding incremental capital to or possibly even reducing your concentration to over time? Owen Thomas : Our -- the way we operate is strategically, we set a perimeter, which are the 6 markets that we're in and the way the capital gets allocated is bottoms up. So what deals arise in those locations that make the most sense for our shareholders and we execute on them. So we pay attention to the top line, what's the contributions from the different markets, but we think it's very important to be nimble and opportunistic as we think about allocating capital across those regions. There have been shifts over time. If you look at the last 5 years, there's clearly been a shift of capital and allocation out of the CBD of Washington, and that would be a change that I would point out. So that's the way we operate the business from a capital allocation standpoint. Operator : And I show our last question in the queue comes from Anthony Powell from Barclays. Anthony Powell : I think you mentioned that variable revenues, including parking was a source of upside in the quarter. Could you remind us where you are in parking revenues on a same property basis versus pre-COVID level? How rate and utilization trended? And could you push parking rates as more people come back to the office going forward? Michael LaBelle : I mean I think we're doing pretty well on parking. We are -- overall, I would say, on parking, if you kind of exclude the fact that we removed a parking garage in Cambridge from service earlier this year, we're actually where we were before.  I do think there's still opportunity to grow that because we're better than where we were before because we have increased rents. We have had occupancy come back into these buildings and into these cities. So I do think there's still room there. But for parking, we're already there. The increase that we had in this quarter for parking was modest. As I said, the kind of the revenue beat was a little bit across the board. It was a little bit in a bunch of different places.  On the retail side, I'd say every place, but San Francisco, we're back. The San Francisco retail contribution before the pandemic was a few million dollars. So hopefully, that will come back at some point. But at this point, I'd say it's still difficult, and we're helping our retailers along. We do have some retail still returning, for example, in Boston, where we close down the Lord & Taylor and we're putting in a fixed sporting goods that's going to open next year.  I mean that's going to be additive to us from a retail perspective. And then the hotel still a couple of million dollars below where it was. So I don't know where that's going to stabilize that. I mean it's doing pretty well. But hopefully, it will continue to improve over time and get back to where it was and above where it was. Operator : I'm showing no further questions in the queue. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Owen Thomas, Chairman and CEO, for closing remarks. Owen Thomas : That concludes our remarks. Thank you all for your interest and attention for BXP. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

During the Q&A portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, Senior Executive Vice President; and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks. Owen Thomas : Thank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover BXP's operating outperformance in the third quarter, key economic and market trends impacting our company. And BXPs capital allocation activities for the quarter. BXP continued to perform in the third quarter despite escalating negative market sentiment for the commercial real estate sector. Our FFO per share was once again above both market consensus and the midpoint of our own forecast. We completed over a million square feet of leasing in the third quarter with a weighted average lease term of over eight years, and increased portfolio occupancy despite a weaker operating environment for most of our clients. We completed multiple company and asset specific financings both elevating our liquidity position and demonstrating BXPs sustained access to the capital markets. Moving to the economy, notwithstanding the Federal Reserve having increased the discount rate, five and a quarter percentage points and the 10-year U.S. Treasury having risen nearly 3% All since the since March of 2022. The U.S. economy's headline statistics remain remarkably strong, with GDP growth at 4.9% in the third quarter 336,000 jobs created in September, and the unemployment rate steady at 3.8%. This rosy economic picture is misleading as it does not accurately reflect the market tone and operating environment for many of our clients. Assuming forecasts for negative earnings growth in the third quarter are accurate. S&P 500 annual earnings growth has been negative for the last four quarters. Much of the recent strength in GDP has been consumption related. And Job creation has been in the leisure and hospitality healthcare, education and government sectors, not in the office seizing sectors such as information and financial services. Our clients are corporations that actively managed their headcount and operating expenses in times of weak or negative earnings growth. And as a result, they're more cautious and making new space commitments. Though remote work is obviously not helping space demand. We believe economic conditions are the primary driver of our slower leasing activity in 2023 and leasing will rebound when earnings growth returns. We continue to be encouraged with the return to office two trajectory we are experiencing in our buildings as well as the rhetoric and actions of many of our clients with respect to their in person work policies. We believe the broadly reported turnstile data from Castle systems indicating buildings are generally 50% occupied versus pre pandemic levels over the course of a whole week is a measure of aggregate human activity important to cities. But it's not an accurate measure of premier workplace space utilization. We collect turnstile data for approximately half of our 54 million square foot portfolio. And as of mid-October for Tuesday through Thursday, our New York City buildings experienced 95% of the turnstile activity achieved before the pandemic.  Those figures for Boston and San Francisco were 74% and 45%, respectively. And the space utilization data in all our markets continues to improve. Workers in premier workplaces are returning to their offices in greater numbers. And it's difficult for users to reduce space if all employees are expected in the office on specific days of the week. Lastly, and importantly, all office buildings are not the same. We share in our IR materials every quarter CBRE's report on the performance of the premier workplace segment of the overall office market. In the five CBDs where BXP operates premier workplaces represent approximately 18% of the total space and 10% of the total buildings. At the end of the third quarter direct vacancy for premier workplaces was 12.4% versus 17% for the balance of the market. Also for the third quarter net absorption for the premiere segment was a positive half a million square feet versus a negative 600,000 square feet for the balance of the market. For the last 11 quarters. Net absorption for the premiere segment was a positive 8.1 million square feet versus a negative 30.8 million square feet for the balance of the market. And asking rents are 44% higher for the premier workplace segment including two buildings undergoing renovation 94% of the BXP CBD space is in buildings rated by CBRE as premier workplaces which has been important in driving the increasing office attendance statistics in our buildings and is a critical differentiator for BXP in the leasing marketplace. Now moving to private real estate capital markets U.S. transaction volume for office assets in the third quarter was muted, dropping 48% from the second quarter to $4.4 billion, the lowest quarterly level of office transact office transaction activity since the first quarter of 2010. Investors in the sector face material uncertainties in both office demand due to factors previously mentioned, as well as the cost and availability of debt financing. The 10-year U.S. Treasury has been and is rising and approaching 5% and consensus market sentiment currently believes rates will be higher for longer given pernicious inflation. Most U.S. lenders are trying to reduce their exposure to commercial real estate loans and have limited available lending capacity for repayments. No sales and BXPs core markets were completed in the third quarter of significant assets that would be considered premier workplaces. In Boston, there were three completed office transactions all under $100 million of reasonably well leased assets and sold for $290 to $690 a square foot and 6.7% to 7.5% cap rates. In Santa Monica the pin factory a fully leased 220,000 square foot redeveloped creative office complex sold for $178 million, representing pricing as of over $800 a foot and an 8.4% cap rate. The existing leases in the asset have turned but are significantly above market and seller financing was provided. In New York City a user is under agreement to purchase the 400,000 square foot vacant Neiman Marcus store at 20 Hudson Yards for $550 million or $1,375 per square foot. In the financial district of San Francisco there are for sales either completed or pending for buildings that are or nearly vacant. Each sale is for under $65 million, and pricing ranges from $120 to $320 a square foot. These deals reflect many of the characteristics prevalent in today's non premier office sales market, entrepreneurial in many cases family office buyers attracted by the low per square foot values relative to historical levels. Small transaction sizes requiring less capital and likely not involving debt financing and renovation plans designed to take advantage of future leasing market recovery. Moving to BXPs capital market activity for the third quarter we completed a restructuring of our investment in Metropolitan Square, a recently renovated 657,000 square foot office building located in Washington, DC. BXP owned a 20% interest in and provided leasing and management services for the asset, which was encumbered by senior loan of $305 million and a mezzanine loan of $115 million. The existing mezzanine lender now owns 100% interest in the property, with BXP continuing to provide management and leasing services. Further, a new undrawn $100 million mezzanine loan has been structured to fund future leasing, operating and other expenses of the property on an as needed basis. BXP has a 20% interest in the new mezzanine loan, which is subordinate only to the $305 million senior loan and will receive interest at 12% annual return. BXP will continue to earn leasing and property management fees as well as an attractive return with potential incentive fees for providing additional capital to stabilize the asset. We also experienced a $36 million gain as a result of the transaction. In the coming quarters, given the negative sentiment toward the office industry, which spills over into the much better performing premier workplace segment. We believe BXP will be presented with unique opportunities to expand its portfolio on an attractive basis. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we have maintained access to capital primarily through the unsecured debt markets, available to few public and private competitors. Our portfolio is outperforming peers due to its attractiveness in the market when competing for clients the hallmark of a premier workplace portfolio. In anticipation of the current market distress in our sector, we have been positioning BXP to play offense for the past year by raising $4.1 billion in gross funding and currently holding $2.7 billion in liquidity. In search of opportunities, we're maintaining continuous dialogue with lenders that are foreclosing on or restructuring assets as well as owner seeking to reduce their office exposure. Our focus will remain in our core markets on premier workplace assets, life science and residential development. During the last major downturn caused by the global financial crisis, BXP was able to acquire the General Motors Building, 200 Clarendon Street, 100 Federal Street and 510 Madison all at attractive prices at the time. On dispositions, we continue to pursue additional capital raising through joint ventures with select pre-leased developments and to consider incremental asset sales. Our development portfolio continues to create FFO growth for BXP. This quarter we placed fully into service 104,000 square foot renovated and fully leased building at 140 Kendrick Street in Needham, Massachusetts. This redevelopment completed for a client with stringent sustainability objectives was delivered with net zero carbon performance and generating an 18% first year yield on incremental capital invested. We also delivered into service 751 gateway as part of our gateway Life Science Park, which is a 231,000 square foot lab building that is fully leased. BXP owns the 49% interest in the asset which was delivered at a 6.7% first year return on cost. BXP continues to execute a significant development pipeline with 11 office lab retail and residential projects underway. These projects aggregate approximately 2.8 million square feet and 2.4 billion of BXP investment with 1.4 billion remaining to be funded and are projected to generate attractive yields in the aggregate upon delivery. So, in summary, despite strong negative market sentiment, BXP had another productive quarter with financial performance and leasing above expectations and a stable dividend. BXP is well positioned to weather the current economic slowdown given our leadership position in the premier workplace market segment. Our strong and liquid balance sheet with access to multiple capital sources, our significant development pipeline providing growth. And our potential to gain market share in both assets and clients due to the current market dislocation. Over to Doug, Douglas Linde : Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. Client demand across our portfolio has remained pretty stable over the last quarter but final leasing decisions are taking longer not pretty consistent with what Owen\u2019s talking about relative to challenges with regards to the profitability of corporations. Our buildings continue to see the most activity from financial services, professional services, law firms, administrative services and asset management. Traditional technology demand continues to be absent from our markets and more times than not renewing technology clients are reducing their leased premises. This is most prevalent in our West Coast properties. Pretty much the same picture that I painted last quarter. Growth from the AI organizations in the city of San Francisco is real. More than 700,000 square feet of leasing has occurred in the past few weeks. And there have been billions of dollars of recent investment into this growing ecosystem. For now, that leasing is focused on large well-built opportunities that are available at significant discounted terms relative to the rents being achieved in premier buildings. Reducing availability is a positive for the broader San Francisco market, but it's not going to impact leasing and Embarcadero center in 2024. The concentration of strongest user demand, often with growth for our assets, is still broadly speaking alternative asset managers, private equity venture, hedge funds specialized fund managers, these companies are growing their teams and capital under management. This pool of clients typically wants to occupy premier workplaces to illustrate the point. During the third quarter, we completed a 15,000 square foot expansion for a hedge fund in Manhattan. And a 52,000 square foot multi floor lease with a private equity firm growing in our portfolio in Manhattan. A 70,000 square foot asset manager is growing in our portfolio in Manhattan, and an expansion for a 21,000 square foot private equity firm in DC. Our strongest activity remains in our Midtown Manhattan portfolio, 200 Clarendon and the Prudential Center in Boston, the urban core of Reston Town Center in Northern Virginia, and our Embarcadero center assets in San Francisco. We don't have direct availability at Salesforce tower, but we hear through the market that Salesforce has interest in their 150,000 square foot sublet opportunity. Law firms are also an active portion of our portfolio and important clients for BXP. We are in active lease negotiations or LOI discussions with seven distinct law firms in Manhattan, DC and San Francisco. Owen highlighted that just over one million square foot have signed leases during the third quarter. Last October, we provided the leasing expectations embedded in our \u201823 guidance between 500 to a million square feet per quarter, aka 750,000 square feet on average, or 3 million for 2023. Through the first half of the year, we were at 1.56 million. So to date, we're at 2.7 million square feet. We currently have an additional 1.2 million square feet of transactions and active lease documentation. I would say we have a high confidence that we will be beating our leasing target embedded in our 2023 guidance of 3 million square feet. This quarter the executed leases included 52 transactions 32 renewals 20 new tenants, there were five contractions and five expansions among our existing clients with a net reduction in that pool of about 33,000 square feet. There were no particular patterns relative to industry or size, given who is expanding and contracting, bringing the volume down by market we did about 439,000 in Boston, 240,000 square feet in New York, 100,000 square feet in DC and 278,000 square feet in the West Coast market. The mark-to-market of the leases that commenced this quarter was down 3% as reported in their supplemental, the mark-to-market of leases executed this quarter was positive 4%. The starting cash rents on leases we signed this quarter on second generation space were up 60% in Boston, about 1% in New York and then down 13 in DC, nine in San Francisco, 14% in LA and 6% in Seattle. We ended the third quarter with an in-service occupancy of 88.8% compared to 88.3% last quarter. As Owen said during the third quarter 140 Kendrick Street and six 751 Gateway were added to the portfolio and Met Square was taken out. If you remove Met Square from the second quarter that comparative period occupancy went from 88.7 to 88.8. So again, modest, relevant increase. I would also note that we terminated WeWork and 44,000 square feet in the third quarter. We expect to have additional portfolio vacancy stemming from WeWork defaults as we move through the fourth quarter and into 2024. Just to remind everyone, we work leases 493,000 square feet as of 10, 01,\u201923, the BXP share of 2023 annualized revenue is $33 million. We don't expect we work to exit all the assets, nor do we expect them to remain in place in their current footprint. This will be a drag on 24 occupancy and same store contribution. The development portfolio now sits at 2.8 million square feet and it's 52% leased. We've recently signed a 70,000 square foot office lease with an asset manager at 360 Park Avenue South, bringing it to 18% leased and another floor except 651 Gateway that is now 21% leased to 100% leased assets totaling 335,000 square feet were removed and put into service, which accounts for the change in our total lease and the supplemental. At the end of the quarter, we had signed leases that have yet to commence on our in-service vacancy totaling approximately 750,000 square feet was about 425,000 square feet anticipated to commence in the fourth quarter of \u201823. For the remainder of \u201923 we have about 925,000 square feet of expirations. Much of this is uncovered. So we expect a drop of a few basis points of occupancy at year end. In \u201824, we have a very manageable 5.7% of our total portfolio expiration or 2.7 million square feet. We believe our occupancy will be stable and \u201824 defined as up or down 1% quarter-to-quarter, where we end the -- as relative to where we're going to end the year in 2023. We will provide a leasing of volume outlook for \u201824 along with guidance next quarter. From a broad market perspective, the office supply picture didn't really improve much in the third quarter, with almost every market continuing to experience net negative absorption, Manhattan being the one place where there was some positive. The city specific office brokerage report are starting to characterize the markets in ways that acknowledged the bifurcation between the haves and the have nots and the distinctive trends for premier assets. But they are not publishing their data broadly. The availability in the premier building that Owen described is depicting a more constructive picture and BXP relevant view of office supply. What's clear is that new speculative construction, which presumably would be premiere is non-existent in the marketplace today. Any new construction starts are going to require economic rents, rent and concessions that are vastly different from the current transactions. The major inputs to a new building or construction hard costs, capital costs and leasing velocity. Construction costs started dramatic increases over the past five years with annual increases in the high single digits. We've seen the rate of increase is slowing down but we have not seen any reduction of costs. Construction financing could be found, it's SOFR plus 200 and SOFR was 25 basis points to 50 basis points.  Today construction financing for office space is simply not available from traditional lenders. SOFR it's a five and a quarter. And non-traditional lenders might and I used to word might lend at double digit current interest rates with additional points upfront and lower loan to cost caps. Speculative leasing assumptions also assume a longer lease up. You put all this into a development pro forma. And you need rents that are materially higher than what is supported by current market rents in every one of our cities. This quarter, we completed a 313,000 square foot 10-year renewal in the Back Bay of Boston four years prior to expiration, and a rent level that both parties found attractive. Our client is using all their space, believes it's a critical component of their overall business strategy. And when they looked out into the market did not believe that any new construction was likely to be built on a speculative basis. This meant they would need to pay replacement cost rents and sign a lease now, using all the inputs I just outlined to be a new construction in the Back Bay in four years. And there are no 300,000 square foot blocks of high-rise space available in premier buildings and Back Bay today. New life science activity in the portfolio continues to be like during the quarter we completed our third lease at 651 Gateway for another floor. The property will open in \u201824 and two days each lease requires our partnership to complete turnkey spaces in Waltham, where we have our other life science new development availability, we are seeing some tour activity but there is no urgency for these requirements. There are a few large requirements that are touring but as I have discussed previously, the bulk of immediate demand is from small private companies that are looking for fully built space. BXPs legal teams continue to lease space and outperform the market because our portfolio is fundamentally comprised of premier workplaces. The majority of the demand new and existing clients in the market want to be in these types of properties. And we're investing capital and are building infrastructures, amenities and client\u2019s spaces, which allow our teams to meet client needs. We are all seeing the stress that many buildings are feeling due to their current capital structure and the reality of the supply and demand fundamentals reflected in the leasing market activity. The transition or recapitalization or re-equitization of these buildings is going to take an extended period of time. Many of these assets are not in a position to commit capital to existing or new tenants, which greatly impacts the leasing brokers interested in considering them for their clients, and offers us with the opportunity to further increase our market share. I'll stop here and turn things over to Mike. Michael LaBelle : Great, thank you. Good morning, everybody. I'm going to start my comments with some discussion on the debt markets and our activity. Then I will go over the third quarter performance and the changes to our 2023 earnings guidance. We have another busy financing quarter this quarter, we extended or refinanced mortgage facilities totaling $570 million. The two largest of these related to our hub on causeway premier workplace and retail mixed use project that's in Boston. First, we exercise the first of two one-year extension options we have on the $337 million mortgage loan on the office tower. And second, we completed a three-year refinancing of the $155 million mortgage loan secured by the low rise, creative office and retail component. We also expanded our corporate line of credit by $315 million to $1.8 billion. We honestly were surprised by the market's reaction we issued a press release on this earlier this quarter. As it increases our liquidity at a pretty modest cost. We had three new banks approach us, seeking to expand their relationship with us and up-tier the quality of their own client base. With so much uncertainty and illiquidity in the bank markets, our view is expanding our roster of banking relationships as a smart move. Last week, we closed on a new five-year, $600 million mortgage loans from a syndicate of banks on a portfolio of three premier workplaces in Cambridge. The credit spread at SOFR plus 225 basis points, is attractive in today's market. And we expect to use the proceeds to repay our upcoming $700 million bond maturity in February next year. Given the significant recent move in interest rates, we are happy with the timing of our last couple of bond deals, both of which have been below market coupons today. We have no more financing needs in 2023, and we've taken care of a large piece of our 2024 maturities, which is the $700 million bond I just mentioned. Our other 2024 maturities include our $1.2 billion term loan and $400 million at our share of floating rate mortgages. The term loan is also floating rate, though we have swapped SOFR to be fixed at 4.64% through May of 2024. We expect to exercise one year extension options that are available on both the term loan and the majority of the maturing mortgages. As you think about our interest expense, moving into 2024, you need to account for higher borrowing costs. We are refinancing $1.2 billion of bonds that expired in August of 2023 and February of 2024, that had a weighted average interest rate of 3.5%, with new financing at an average rate of 7%. Additionally, we've been running with an average cash balance of approximately $1 billion in 2023. In 2024, we expect to fund our development pipeline with available cash, and run with an average balance closer to $400 million. At our current earnings rate, this projects to a decrease of approximately $30 million of interest income in 2024. Now I want to turn to our third quarter earnings results. For the quarter, we reported funds from operations of $1.86 per share that was $0.02 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range. The outperformance all came from better-than-projected portfolio of net operating income. Revenues were higher than our assumptions from a mix of better rental revenues, client service income, parking and hotel performance. Our operating expenses were in line with our assumptions. While not impacting our FFO, we did record non-cash impairment charges totaling $273 million this quarter, related to four of our unconsolidated joint ventures. The GAAP rules for unconsolidated joint ventures dictate that if we believe a loss in asset value below our basis is not temporary, the asset is market to fair value. The definition of temporary is somewhat subjective, but as the length of the current market dislocation extends, it's harder to justify a temporary loss in value. The charges relate to Platform 16, which we discussed last quarter, as well as 360 Park Avenue South, 200 Fifth Avenue and Safeco Plaza. Given the cyclical nature of the real estate business, the value of assets like these will recover in the future when interest rates normalize and corporate economic conditions improve. And we expect to hold these assets through their recovery. Our past experience reflects this recovery after the GFC, we took a similar impairment charge and ultimately, we sold the assets a few years later at a significant gain, not only to the impaired value but to the original book values of the buildings as well. Now I want to turn to our guidance for the rest of 2023. We have narrowed our 2023 guidance range to $7.25 to $7.27 per share, with the midpoint relatively unchanged from last quarter at $7.26 per share. There are two key changes to our guidance from last quarter. First, we're projecting $0.03 per share of higher termination income in the fourth quarter from lease terminations with WeWork at Madison Center, and Dock 72, as they have stopped paying rent in both locations. We have security deposits to cover a portion of the lost rent, which we will recognize as termination income. The revenue loss is approximately $6.5 million per year until those spaces are re-leased to other clients. They comprise approximately 200,000 square feet that equates to about 40 basis points of our occupancy. Second, we anticipate our net interest expense will be higher by approximately $0.03 per share due to lower projected capitalized interest and closing the new $600 million mortgage financing earlier than we had previously expected. We expect to invest the funds and cash equivalents until we repay our bond expiration at the beginning of February, and the negative arbitrage on the funds is about $3 million in 2023. The remainder of our assumptions for the portfolio performance has not changed. As Doug described, we continue to execute leases in line with our expectations, and net of the lease terminations, our outlook for occupancy remains stable. As we look ahead into 2024, we have several developments that delivered during 2023 or will deliver in 2024, that will add incremental FFO next year. These include 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue, 651 and 751 Gateway, 140 Kendrick Street, 180 CityPoint and View Boston. However, as I described earlier, we expect our overall earnings trajectory will be negatively impacted by the persistent high interest rate environment that will result in higher net interest expense in 2024. We will provide detailed earnings guidance for 2024 on next quarter's call in January. That completes our formal remarks. Operator, can you please open the lines up for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And I show our first question, comes from the line of Blaine Heck from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Blaine Heck : Great. Thanks, good morning. Can you guys just talk about the acquisition or investment environment a little bit more? It still seems like we haven't seen the ways of opportunities that some well-capitalized potential investors, including yourselves, have been hoping for. I guess, are there any signs that opportunities are emerging? And if not, do you have any sense what needs to happen to shake things loose and when that might happen? And then lastly, in general, how much further does pricing need to adjust to make those investment opportunities more attractive from a risk-reward standpoint? Owen Thomas : Yeah. It's Owen, I'll take a crack at that. I think that, as I mentioned in my remarks, I think buyers are concerned about two things. One, how do they underwrite lease-up and lease growth given some of the economic uncertainty that our clients face, as I discussed. And then second, what's their cost of capital, particularly their financing and can they get financing? So a lot of the deals that are happening right now, as I described, are small, private investors, probably not using much, if any, debt financing, things like that. So I think for -- so first of all, I think there's a tremendous amount of restructuring activity that's going on in the market generally. It may not all be reported, but it's definitely happening because there are over leveraged loans that are coming due all the time. And borrowers are in discussions with their lenders on what to do. So, there are lots of those things going on right now. And then I think second, for buyers to get more active, there has to be more visibility on the two uncertainties that I mentioned. I do think some of the interest rate behavior this morning might actually be somewhat helpful to that, because I do think a stabilization of interest rates would be very helpful for buyers to get more comfortable to do transactions. In terms of how much the price has to drop, I think for the space that we're interested in, which are obviously a higher quality building, it's hard to say, because there's not a lot of transactions that you can look at and say, what is the pricing today? But I just don't think, I think our general view at the moment is, all of the negative perspective out there on office is, in our view at least irrationally spilling over into premier workplaces, which will create opportunities for BXP. Operator : And I show our next question, comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Nicholas Yulico : Thanks. I was hoping we can maybe get a feel for in terms of the impairments that were done to the JVs, if there's any sense on how much the unlevered asset values may have changed in that impairment analysis? Michael LaBelle : Sure, Nick, this is Mike. The information in our supplement, I don't want to go through those details right now, but there is information in our supplemental that provides kind of what the changes in net equity values are on those assets. So, that you can determine that. Overall, from our perspective, this is an accounting adjustment that we felt we needed to make based upon the accounting rules for our consolidated joint ventures. And I don't think it necessarily reflects a meaningful change in the prospects of these assets other than Platform 16, which we talked about last quarter, where we're stopping construction. The other ones, if we had to look at -- we looked at every one of our joint ventures, just like we do every quarter. And given the kind of higher for longer and the rates. Our view is that these rates are going to be this high, and it's not necessarily going to be temporary to us. It's like, is it more than a year or not basically. And so we looked at everything and there were three other ones that just kind of got tripped. So, we reflected those. And those three other ones were smaller. Platform 16 was clearly the biggest one by far, because if you start looking at the kind of discounting the cash flows for a land development deal until you're actually going to build it. The discount rate that you would use on a development rate, which is pretty high, has a significant impact on the value. Nicholas Yulico : Thank you. Operator : And I show our next question, comes from the line of John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. John Kim : Thank you. Doug, in your prepared remarks, you talked about occupancy basically remaining stable next year despite another year of a very favorable backdrop, 2.7 million square feet expiring, your pipeline is 1.2 million square feet. That happens to be your quarterly average. So, I was wondering what known move-outs are there that you see next year? And anything else -- any other tenants besides WeWork, that will be a headwind to breaking out of that 88% to 89% occupancy range? Douglas Linde : Yeah. So, there's a difference between know, no move-outs and tenants being headwind. So because tenants that are moving out are not moving out because they're, potentially, \"in financial difficulty\", right? So, the only tenant of significance that we have in our portfolio, which is obviously having financial challenges is WeWork, there are some smaller tenants, 25,000 or 30,000 square feet that we're -- that we have every year in our portfolio, who don't seem to have a business plan that's going to be long term in nature and ultimately, they give up their space. But those are de minimis. The portfolio of expirations next year actually are not -- there aren't any enormous ones. There are a couple on the West Coast, and a couple in the greater Manhattan, our New York City region, about 250,000 square feet in Princeton and just over 200,000 square feet at the building that we have on Folsom, in San Francisco, and then we're going to lose about 75,000 square feet of space from expiration Trulia, Zillow at 535. And those are really the only large ones, other than our joint venture property at 250, Times Square Tower, where O'Melveny & Myers is moving out, about 250,000 square feet, but we've covered already 75,000 to 100,000 square feet of that expiration. So it's not any sort of large particular roll out that's driving our stability sort of comment. There are three different kinds of leasing we do. We do leasing, where we have available space that we lease, and that leasing typically involve a build-out. And in our marketplaces today, those build-out periods tend to be extended, meaning, we're looking at not knowing whether or not the tenant will be in occupancy in six months or nine months or 12 months, and we can't typically book revenue on those particular assets and, therefore, increase our occupancy until those occur. And that's why we started providing this, leased but not yet in service statistic, which is going to grow over time, and you'll see a lot of that, I believe, in 2024. And so it's not going to impact our occupancy, but the leases are signed. The second kind of leasing we do are tenants that are renewing and they're renewing in a relatively short period of time, meaning, the next 12 months. And those immediately hit. The third type of leasing that we're doing is for leases that may be expiring in years post the 2024 expirations. And so as an example, I described the 300,000 square foot deal that we did this quarter, which was for 2028. So, our leasing volumes, I believe, will continue to be at a relatively strong level for the economic period that we're in, but it's going to be -- it's stubborn to sort of get that occupancy up in the short term. I've said this in the one-on-one calls and in our presentations that we've made at Nareit and other analyst meetings, which is that our West Coast portfolio, it\u2019s really where the opportunity is to drive enhanced occupancy. So, the space that we have available at Embarcadero Center and what I just described at Folsom Street in our 535 market, as well as some of the availability that we now have because of lease terminations in Seattle and Madison Center on that end and a Colorado Center in West L.A. Those are really the sort of bigger blocks of space that we have in terms of overall volumes that will drive a outsized opportunity for growth, as opposed to where we are now, which is we're sort of treading water at this sort of 88% to 89% level. And we're going to make some marginal improvements. And then one quarter, we may have a little bit of degradation because we have a particular tenant moving out, but we're making it up. So, that's sort of the state of our views as we look at 2024. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question, comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Piper. Mr. Goldfarb your line is open. Alexander Goldfarb : Great. Thank you. Morning down there. So, question on development. In the release, you guys talked about an extension until February '24 for your 25% stake in the 3 Hudson, in the land loan that's under 3 Hudson. And at the same time, articulated your optionality on the MTA site. Just looking at the two projects, the MTA site would seem to be like the winner just given the focus on Grand Central, Park Avenue, whereas 3 Hudson just seems like a more challenged deal given the economics of trying to lease up that building at the necessary rent given the size of that building. So, as you guys think about the upcoming land loan on 3 Hudson, is that something that you would consider just sort of exiting instead of pursuing, and mentioning the MTA optionality, should we take that as considering that maybe you guys would not proceed forward with the MTA site? Douglas Linde : Yeah. So Alex, this is Doug. I'm going to let Hilary give you the most detail on this. I would just make the following comment, which is, we don't think one is a winner versus the other. I think it's clear that the timing opportunities associated with one are probably shorter than the other in terms of when we might actually get something going. But I'll let Hilary describe the demand for space in new buildings and also the challenges associated with getting those deals going. Hilary? Hilary Spann : Thanks, Doug. Hi, Alex. So, as Doug noted, the two buildings are very, very different opportunities. 3 Hudson Boulevard is a 1.8 million square foot building, whereas 343 Madison is currently still in the design process, but let's just call it, 850,000 square foot to 900,000 square foot building. So, some of the demand that is currently in the market actually could not be satisfied by 343 Madison. So there are a few tenants in the market that are 1 million square feet, that are actively looking for space and they would need a larger building than what can be constructed at 343 Madison. To Doug's point, in order to build such a building, those clients would have to be willing to pay a rent that generated an acceptable return on cost to us at 343 Madison. And those decisions in this capital market environment takes time for clients or prospective clients like those to make. The prospective client base at 343 Madison, by definition, is somewhat smaller. There's plenty of demand among clientele in that square footage range as well. And again, the question really comes down to who's willing to commit to the project at the rents needed to launch the development. But I view them as distinctly different opportunities. And opportunities that serve different segments of the market. So, hopefully, that answers your question. But I agree with Doug. I wouldn't characterize one as better than the other. They're just very, very different opportunities. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question, comes from the line of Michael Griffin from Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Griffin : Great. Thanks. I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned some assets you're considering for sale. I'm just curious if you can quantify, what kind of IRRs buyers are looking at and kind of where pricing would need to be in order for you to effectuate on any of these potential sales? Owen Thomas : Well, I think it varies, Michael, widely, depending on the quality and location of the asset, the leasing status of the asset, the walls of the asset. I think borrowing cost today with the 10-year, I guess it's dropped a little bit today, but pushing 7%, I think for the highest quality assets, you're definitely above that. And for an asset that has a lot of leasing and other risks associated with it. I think you're looking at double-digit return. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question, comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith from UBS. Please go ahead. Michael Goldsmith : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Owen, you mentioned in the prepared remarks about how BXP's tenants are more cautious in the space commitments on many of the traditional macro indicators may not accurately reflect what's going on in your business. So, recognizing that different cycles have different drivers. What metrics do you think might more accurately reflect the business now, and are the ones that you're monitoring so that we can follow along at home? Thanks. Owen Thomas : Well, so I think this is part of something that's been confusing in the marketplace because generally, when you have a recession, company's earnings are down. And they lease less space, and that's what\u2019s help cycles have traditionally operated for office companies, because leasing slows down when you have a recession. Here, it's confusing because it's very different. All the economic indicators look favorable, GDP growth, employment statistics. But if you dig into those statistics, it's a lot of its consumption related. And a lot of the job creation isn't in office using jobs. And then if you look at earnings, which is what our clients are looking at, is their own earnings trajectory, it's negative. It's been negative for the last year, assuming the third quarter is negative. So, that is the driver of client behavior. If you're the CEO of a company, and your lease is coming up or you're thinking about your space requirement, your decisions about that are going to be very contingent upon what you think the future prospects of your business are. And many businesses are negatively impacted by rising rates and some of the uncertainty in the economic environment. So, that's the backdrop. And so I think coming back to your question, I think certainly lower rates will help. And I think as earnings generally rise, I would expect that our leasing activity will rise with it. Douglas Linde : And Michael, this is Doug. I would just say that the best measure of corporate activity as it relates to the business that we are in, is job growth. And job growth typically is a little bit murkier. You can look at the employment numbers, but you really have to get into the specific industry categories, right? So government and hospitality are not going to be favorable to office, but financial services or technology or life sciences are going to be. And as you start to see the job listings start to perk up a bit, as you start to see hiring announcements by many of the larger technology companies and some of the financial institutions, which do in fact, broadly talk about those things, you will clearly see a more, I would say, conducive environment for office leasing on a going forward basis. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Jason Wayne from Barclays. Please go ahead. Jason Wayne : Good morning. You said in your prepared remarks, you don't expect WeWork to exit all of their assets. So, just wondering where you expect them to stay. And then you previously said that WeWork security deposits average eight months of rent. Is that a good number to think about when looking at termination income moving forward? Douglas Linde : So, I'm not going to get into conjecture on where WeWork is going to decide their -- they have their productive units. And where they do it or where they don't. As Mike said, at the moment, they have stopped paying rent on two of our locations, which are at Madison Center in Seattle, and Dock 72 in Brooklyn. And we have three other locations with them which are in San Francisco. So that's the universe, and the decision as to what they are going to do, I think, is going to take some time. And they're going to have to figure it out. And then we're going to have the decisions to make as to whether or not we're comfortable with whatever they propose to us. And or taking the space back. So, I think that it's impossible for me to tell you where they're going to exit and where they're not going to exit. Mike, you can talk about security. Michael LaBelle : Yeah. I think on -- I mean you're correct on the security deposit because we said that before, that we have about eight months of security. And if the tenant defaults, we try to -- we sent out a lease termination. We execute that lease termination with the client. And if there's a security deposit, we get that, and we booked that all on the day that we get it. If the client is going to stay in the space for another 90 days or six months. We might have to amortize that over that period of time. The one thing I would add is that in the fourth quarter termination income guidance, there's two pieces to the termination income. One is, determination income we're going to be collecting that I described. But also at Madison Center in Seattle, their lease is way below market. So, there's what is called a fair value adjustment to the rent. And in order to take that off our balance sheet, we book that as income. So, about half of that termination income is this fair value that's kind of a noncash concept. And the concept is that once we get that space back either at termination or at natural maturity, we will be able to re-lease that space at a higher market rent. So, hopefully, we will be able to do that. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question, comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Steve Sakwa : Yeah, thanks. I just wanted to circle back, Owen, on the distressed opportunities. I guess I'm just trying to get a sense from you as to kind of where you would need to peg stabilized yields in order to deploy new BXP capital given your trading 10 times cash flow and north of an 8% implied cap rate. And then just from a market perspective, could any of those opportunities take you to any new markets like, say, a San Diego or Austin to be, in addition to the existing markets? Owen Thomas : I'll answer the second first and come back to your first question, Steve. So, we don't think we need to go to any new markets. We have a very significant footprint in our six core cities. And, in fact, one of the things that's going on now, which we have been talking about for several years is that the vacancy rates in certain areas of the Southeast and Southwest are actually higher than many of our core markets because of all the new development that's going on. So, we don't see a need or reason to expand outside of our footprint. Going back to your question about returns, we're going to focus on the premier segment of the market. And, so I think it's likely that the types of assets that we'll get involved in are un-stabilized. So, I'm not sure that the way to look at it is cap rate, but the way to look at it is total return. And I think that the total return requirement on a particular acquisition that we would look at would be, pushing double-digit returns. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question, comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Caitlin Burrows : Hi, good morning. Earlier, you guys talked about how you're opting to repay the $700 million of unsecured debt with mortgages collateralized by Cambridge properties at SOFR plus 225. So, what did you consider when opting for secured floating rate debt beyond just price? Was it price mixed with kind of BXP mix of debt or anything else? And I guess, in that decision, you were considering 10-year bonds. So, what pricing do you think you could issue a 10-year bond at today? Thanks. Michael LaBelle : Yeah. So, this is Mike. Look, we evaluated all the different markets when we decide how we're going to do a refinancing, and the credit spreads in the secured markets for very high-quality assets with long lease terms, we found is better than what the credit spread we can get from the bond market. So, our bond spreads right now for 10 years is about 285 for five years, it's probably 270-kind of area. So we're saving a lot in credit spread. The other opportunity, I think, we have is we're doing a floating rate deal. We haven't fixed it. We do have the opportunity to fix it via swap. And we're going to evaluate when and if we do that. As we kind of look at what's going on with interest rates over the next period of months. And if it becomes evident that SOFR is going to be dropping significantly by the FED in 2024 and 2025, we may keep the floating. If we see an opportunity to fix it because there's some sort of dislocation between the swap markets, we may fix that for a period of time.  So I think it provides some flexibility that way. And it\u2019s also a floating rate mortgage is prepayable. So if the market gets better for long-term debt two years from now, we can prepay this into a long-term fixed rate deal at that time. So, it does have some advantages that we looked at when we decided to do this bank financing. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question, comes from the line of Upal Rana from KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Upal Rana : Great, thank you. Doug, you went through some of the supply and sublease space availability in your prepared remarks. Given the elevated levels of supply and some of these spacing your markets, potential tenants have a lot more to look at today. Do you have a sense of how much of the available space is in direct competition with your buildings? And even though some of them may not be premier buildings, your potential tenants may be looking at them. I'm trying to get a sense of why tenants maybe, deciding to choose between your building versus others in today's environment? And if they're being more price sensitive today versus, or it could be something else? Douglas Linde : Yeah. So, this is what I refer to as one of the sort of layup questions that I'm going to allow our regional teams to answer, because I think that they will be more -- they will be passionate about their responses. But in general, what I would tell you is not all space is the same. And there are many, many buildings that have either direct availability or sublet availability that are literally not part of the conversation. And so as you think about micro submarkets, getting down to a market like Park Avenue between 43rd Street and 59th Street. Or you're talking about an asset in the CBD of Washington DC that has views and is in a premier building, you would be surprised at how small the universe of opportunities may be. So, why don't I let Rod talk about the issues associated with the availability of chemicals [ph] that we're really dealing with. And then I'll let Brian talk about Boston. Rod? Rodney Diehl : Yeah. Hello everybody. So, there's definitely sublease space, a lot of it as everybody knows, in San Francisco. And some of it is higher end space. In fact, that's where a lot of the bigger deals over these last two years have actually happened. Some of them have been in our own buildings. 680 Folsom, for example, macys.com had roughly 240,000 feet available. And they leased all of it during the pandemic subleases. So, at the good space that has been out there has attracted some attention. But by and large, there's so much more that is not high quality and has either got no term left on it or it's got poor sponsorship with weak sublessors. So, those spaces are very difficult, and they're not going to compete with. We're not going to compete with them for sure. If tenant that's interested in those types of spaces is not going to go to any premier building. Bryan Koop : Yeah, I would echo the same thing. I just had a brokerage dinner last night and with tenant rep people. And each of them expressed the same issue, which was, for their top-end clients, premier clients, they're having trouble with fewer locations to review. And it's not only just the amount of locations that they think are appropriate and been a lack of desire to do a sublease. And most of our sublease space tends to be in lower floors in this market right now. There's also the question of, for the first time I'm seeing tenant rep people really underwriting the landlord's capability to fund TIs. And that hasn't happened in a long time. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question, comes from the line of Dylan Burzinski from Green Street. Please go ahead. Dylan Burzinski : Good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the question. I guess just going back to your comments on acquisition opportunities. Are there certain markets that you guys are looking at that you're getting more excited about deploying capital in today's environment? Owen Thomas : The way we think about this is, we set, top down a parameter, which we have, which is our six markets. And in terms of specific investments, that is a bottoms-up process and a more opportunistic process. So, we're open for business everywhere, and it just depends on the opportunity, and we want to allocate capital to the best opportunities. That all being said, as you've heard from our remarks and you see in our results. It's easier to underwrite leasing activity in our East Coast markets, particularly in New York and Boston, than it is in our West Coast market. So, the assumptions that we would use in underwriting deals would obviously be more challenging on the West Coast given the market behavior. Douglas Linde : Yeah. I just want to add one thing. And then maybe I'll let Hilary comment on this, for New York, which is, there is no question that the overall amount of demand in the market in the -- what I would refer to as sort of the Park Avenue District of New York, which is this area between, call it, 43rd Street and the 59th Street, Park Madison, Lexington, a little bit of Fifth Avenue is by far the strongest market from a demand perspective, we're seeing in the country. There are still really, really challenged opportunities in that market that are going to have to get resolved relative to the capital structures that these buildings are currently operating under. And you are not going to be able to, in my opinion, replace the mortgages that were put on many of these buildings, including Bs and mezzanine capital and preferred equity to the same level, which means there's going to be an equitization requirement. And that's going to potentially create opportunities, which, by the way, as both Owen and Mike said, that's why we were able to acquire the General Motors Building in 2008. That's why we were able to acquire 510 Madison Avenue. And Hilary, you may want to just sort of talk about what's going on in Manhattan. Hilary Spann : Sure. Thanks, Doug. So as Doug mentioned, there are a number of high-quality assets in really desirable submarkets, the Park Avenue corridor, really all the way up to where the General Motors Building is that, or underwater on their financing and are having difficulty rationalizing, putting capital into the buildings to support leasing opportunities. And so we're really getting a lot of inbounds from the perspective of -- clients know that we have a strong balance sheet. They know that we're not over levered. They know that we can commit capital to leasing. So that's interesting to our benefit. And we're watching those situations where capital stacks are upside down, which may potentially present an opportunity for us. But again, to the point that Owen and Doug have raised, we would only really be interested in the highest quality assets that are premier workplace is consistent with what we already own. I would tell you, there's at least a handful of those situations in Midtown that we're tracking. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question, comes from the line of Peter Abramowitz from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Peter Abramowitz : Yes. Thank you. One or two of your peers have mentioned just potentially some pressure on operating margins going forward, as return to office mandates have more of an effect than more people are in the office. Just wondering if you could talk about that, potentially, how we should think about that for your portfolio moving forward? Douglas Linde : I'm going to get to be sort of tongue in cheek. We don't have any peers. We are who we are. And we operate our buildings in a very different way. And we've been operating our buildings with an expectation that our buildings are fully occupied for the last couple of years. So, return to work and increase occupancy, in my opinion, is going to have no impact on our margins. What will have an impact on our margins are, what I would refer to as the sort of atmospherics out there, which are, how will the labor rates associated with union contracts for janitorial work their way out? Will the insurance markets continue to be challenging relative to the number of weather-related events and how that's impacting desirability of the insurers to provide insurance? What will the municipalities do relative to their tax burden and valuations because valuations are clearly coming down, right? And so how will that be reflected in their desires to increase their rates. All of those things, I think, are going to have some degree of pressure on margins. They're not going to have pressure on margins on an incremental basis. It's going to be over a period of time because either our leases are triple net or there are growths with our operating base and that operating base is step based upon the existing lease. So, until you get the rollover, you don't really have that impact on your overall flow. And in general, if you look back historically, over the past decade, my guess is that the margins for BXP are somewhere in the mid- to high 60s, and they haven't really fluctuated very much. So, I don't think that is an issue. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question, comes from the line of Camille Bonnel from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Camille Bonnel : Good morning. So, despite your FED payout ratio picking up this quarter, I know your FED is on track this year to deliver one of its best years. As we head into year-end using third quarter as a base, are there any factors we should be considering that could impact it after considering the FFO changes you highlighted? And can you help us understand how your FED growth has generally kept pace or outpaced FFO given how office is such a capital-intensive business? Thank you. Michael LaBelle : Thanks, Camille. I'll take that one. So, you're right. I mean, our FFO has held up really well. In fact, I anticipate that it's going to be somewhere between 5% and 10% higher than it was last year. And the primary reason for that is two things. One, we had a lot of free rent that burned off last year with some large leasing that we had done. And that became cash rent this year. So, that really helped our FFO. And then our leasing expirations in 2023 were lower. So we actually had to do less leasing to maintain the occupancy that we had. So our lease transaction costs are also a little bit lower. I think in the fourth quarter, we will see some incremental CapEx, if you look at the first three quarters of CapEx, it's not really where we would have a typical run rate for CapEx. So, I think our teams out there are trying to get everything done. So I do think that our CapEx will be a little bit higher in the fourth quarter. But overall, I mean, if you -- the guidance for FFO would be something like $5 and $5.20 is what we're looking at, which I think is pretty solid. So, the run rate is a little bit lower in the fourth quarter than it has been, basically due to kind of catching up on the CapEx items that we've planned, but haven't quite been completed yet. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question, comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ronald Kamdem : Hey just wanted to zoom in on the life sciences segment. If you could talk about what activity or the pipeline is looking like? And if you can comment on large tenants versus middle and smaller users would be helpful. Thanks. Douglas Linde : Sure. So, again, the breadth of our life science activity is our property at 651 Gateway, which we're in partnership with [indiscernible]. And there, the only significant demand that we've been seeing is from small tenants, meaning single-floor type tenants that are looking for turnkey buildouts. And then our other life science opportunity is the two buildings that we have in the Greater Boston marketplace. 180 CityPoint, which is just completed. And when anybody goes there, they are blown away by sort of what it provides, not just from a life science infrastructure, but actually from a human infrastructure in terms of the amenity base that, that building provides to any client and why they would want to be in a building like that. And that our other building at 1034th Avenue. I would say we're seeing consistent tour activity, a couple of tours every week or so. These are, I would refer to as shoppers, not buyers, right? They all have a potential use for space, some of them are lease expiration-driven. Some of them are related to potential opportunities for successful drug discovery from a commercialization perspective and therefore, added capital and therefore, the ability to hire more people, but they are being very, very cautious and it's an elongated process. And for the most part, those tenants are privately funded organizations. There are a few public out there. There's one or two sort of large organizations that are I would say, traveling around in the Greater Boston market as well as in San Francisco that are, I think they are the same names you would have -- you probably would have heard 18 months ago. Looking for space, and they haven't yet to make a decision. And they could, at any time, make a decision or they could continue to postpone. So again, it's a relatively slow process and the demand is like the demand was, call it, back in 2014 or '15 relative to the demand that we were all experiencing in 2019, '20 and early '21 where it was just explosive. Bryan Koop : Yes, for Boston, Doug's description is spot on in terms of the underwriting of what we're seeing.  I would add, over the last two weeks, we have seen some encouraging amount of tour uptick. And in size as well, not huge but midsized 30,000 to 60,000 feet, a couple. And then also, we've been encouraged by the quality, as Doug mentioned, of these clients. Operator : Thank you. And I show, our last question, comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Omotayo Okusanya : Hi, yes. Good morning, everyone. Just if you could make any quick comments just about your outlook on life sciences. Is this an area you think you might dive into more as we go into 2024, fundamentals still somewhat uncertain, and it's an area where you may not do as much in. Any commentary would be appreciated. Thank you. Douglas Linde : Okay. So I'll just, I'll assume that you'll -- the comments that I just made are not meant to be repeated. So let me take a different tack, which is we are not planning on starting any new life science activities in any of our marketplaces given current conditions. That being said, we have opportunities to build some fabulous life science buildings on land, which has virtually no basis in it. And therefore, we have a \"cost advantage\" at some point, if there is demand. When there is that demand, we will sequentially start to think about how we might be attractive to tenants that are looking for buildings where the economics would justify the new construction of the life science relative to where the market economics are. But in the short term, meaning, 2023, 2024, there's going to be absolutely no expectation for us to be starting a new life science building. There are a couple of places in our portfolio where we have existing office installations where there's actually some interested life science demand, were a tenant to show up and say, hey, we want 40,000 square feet in this particular location, would you consider putting the infrastructure in to the building to allow us to do light or heavy lab research? We would consider doing that depending upon the credit of that company. Those organizations could be anywhere in our portfolio. But absent that, what you see is what you get relative to our existing life science platform. Operator : Thank you. And I show, we have a question from the line of Jamie Feldman from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Jamie Feldman : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess since I'm last, maybe if you guys don't mind, if you humor me, I can ask two. First is, you mentioned San Francisco back to 45% of its turnstile activity. I mean, how do you think that plays out over time? That's a meaningful difference from what you said New York, is it 95%? And then secondly, what are partners saying, like capital -- potential capital partners saying in terms of wanting to put money to work in office? Is it more conversion activity? Are there certain markets? Just, are they starting to think about writing checks here more aggressively? Owen Thomas : Yeah. So, Jamie, I'll take a crack at it. Definitely, the Bay Area, and actually, I'd just say the West Coast, Seattle, it's true in L.A. as well, the turnstile activity is slower, I think that is primarily driven by the behavior and policies of the technology client base. They have been less forceful and less prescriptive about having workers come back to the office. That all being said, the activity is increasing, and I think it's going to continue to increase just more slowly. So what was the second part of your question -- was private equity. So look, there is -- I would say, certainly much more limited interest in the private equity industry today generally for office. That's why you're not seeing much transaction activity. As I mentioned in my remarks, most of it is being driven by smaller investors, family offices groups that are seeing the deep discounts that are being offered in the market and are not needing debt financing. That all being said, I do think that sophisticated private equity investors understand the difference between premier workplace and a typical office asset. And I do think for the right asset at the right price, there will be institutional interest in those kinds of assets. Douglas Linde : Yeah, Jamie, this is Doug. What my sort of add-on would be the capital that's currently aggressively thinking about office, is thinking about trading, right? They're looking at, there's an opportunity for us to get in and then get out at a much higher basis and these are trading sardines, not eating sardines. We are in the eating sardine\u2019s business in general in our portfolio. So we're looking at these things on a long-term basis, finding a capital partner that is, today, saying, okay, now I want to jump in and I want to invest money for a duration of 10 or 15 or 20 or infinite years. Is certainly more problematic in terms of just desirability because of the nervousness associated with the overall fundamental. However, there are some, right? And Owen and James Magaldi went to the various parts of the globe this summer and had constructive conversations. We are having constructive conversations with other capital from other parts of the world that are coming into the United States, it's a slow, slow process. And I can't tell you that there's a transaction that will get consummated with BXP with one of those capital partners in the next couple of months. But there are opportunities. And as Owen said earlier in his original comments, we are talking to some JV partners about putting capital into some of our assets right now that would, I think, be the kind of capital that we would look at as long-term quality institutional capital that is not looking to trade for a profit. And so that is what we're focusing our time and attention on. Operator : And I show our next question, comes from the line of Richard Anderson from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Richard Anderson : Yeah, so thanks using Jamie's logic, maybe I could sneak in three questions since I'm last. Douglas Linde : Four if you want. Richard Anderson : So, Owen, getting back to being prepared to take advantage of the marketplace, it sounds like mostly individual assets you're focused on. But could there be smaller portfolios or dare I say, companies, either private or public. Or is that just, does that just get too complicated? And I wonder if you could share some sort of dollar value of the pipeline of opportunities that you're looking at today? Owen Thomas : Yeah. I'm not going to rule anything out, but I do think the reason that BXP has 94% of its portfolio in premier workplaces as the portfolio has been curated one asset at a time, either through acquisition, development also through our disposition activity. So, I think single asset activity is more likely. And I think it's difficult to put a dollar value on what we're looking at. I mean, we are -- our job is to be in dialogue with owners of assets that we're interested in, and the lenders to assets that we're interested in and these dialogues are fluid. And I think it's really hard to put a number on. Operator : Thank you. I show no further questions in the queue. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Owen Thomas, Chairman and CEO, for closing remarks. Owen Thomas : Thank you. We have no more formal remarks. I want to thank everybody for their time, attention and interest in BXP. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending. You may all disconnect.",

Owen Thomas : Thank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. After a brief review of our quarterly and annual performance, I intend to focus my remarks this morning on BXP's significant capital allocation activity over the last quarter, related real estate capital market conditions and key areas of focus for us in 2024. The operating trends I've described in prior quarters, specifically the steady return of workers to their offices, the importance of corporate earnings growth to leasing activity and the outperformance of premier workplaces, all remain important and substantially unchanged. BXP continued to perform in the fourth quarter as we did throughout 2023, despite withering negative market sentiment for the commercial real estate sector. Our FFO per share was $0.01 above market consensus for the fourth quarter and for all of 2023, was $0.15 above the midpoint of the guidance range we provided one year ago. We completed over 1.5 million square feet of leasing in the fourth quarter and 4.2 million square feet of leasing for all of 2023, well above our prior forecast. Over the last year, signed leases remain long term over eight years weighted average and portfolio occupancy remained stable, despite a challenging leasing environment. In 2023, BXP raised over $4 billion in new capital in the public unsecured debt, private secured mortgage and private equity markets. In the fourth quarter alone, we completed a new $600 million mortgage financing, a $750 million asset-specific equity capital raise, both among the largest comparable transactions completed in our sector last year as well as three new and highly accretive equity investments, one of which closed in January. So on capital allocation activities and starting with capital raising, last November, BXP announced the sale to Norges Bank Investment Management of a 45% interest in 290 and 300 Binney Street, both life science developments located in the Kendall Square District of Cambridge, leased on a long-term basis to creditworthy clients. 300 Binney is a 236,000 square foot existing office building that is being converted to lab use and scheduled for delivery at the end of this year, and 290 Binney is a 566,000 square foot ground-up development that we expect to deliver in 2026. Our partner purchased the assets at a gross valuation of $1.66 billion or $2,050 per square foot and an expected initial cash yield on cost at delivery for both assets of 5.9%. BXP will retain a 55% interest in each joint venture and provide development, property management and leasing services. Norges has closed its investment in 300 Binney and funded $213 million, and we expect the 290 Binney joint venture will close in the first quarter of this year, which will reduce approximately $534 million of BXP's development funding requirement over time. We are pleased and honored to grow our important relationship with Norges, BXP's largest joint venture partner and one of our largest shareholders. Upon completion of this transaction, BXP will have raised just under $750 million of equity capital on attractive terms and reduced our forecast leverage. Next, BXP purchased interest in three currently owned assets from two different joint venture partners, one of which closed in early January. These transactions were sparked by anchor client renewals BXP achieved at two of the assets, requiring capital for tenant improvements, leasing commissions and building upgrades. In the current environment, these two joint venture partners decided they wanted to reduce their exposure to office. We agreed to purchase their interest at attractive and accretive returns and complete the long-term lease extension. Regarding the specific deals, 901 New York Avenue is a 548,000 square foot, 83% leased office building located in Washington, D.C. The building is encumbered by a $207 million mortgage, with attractive terms due in 2025. In January, we completed the renewal of the 214,000 square foot anchor client in the building, Finnegan Henderson for 18 years, purchased the 50% interest in the property we didn't own for $10 million and modified the loan to allow for an extension of the maturity date for up to five years. Pricing for the acquisition was $414 per square foot and a 6.4% initial cap rate on an as-is basis, and $516 a square foot with an expected 8.4% cash yield on cost at stabilization in 2027. Santa Monica Business Park is a 21 building 1.2 million square foot and 88% leased office complex located adjacent to the Santa Monica Airport. The property is encumbered by a $300 million mortgage due in 2025, and 70% of the park is encumbered by a ground lease, with above-market ground rent and a fee purchase option in 2028. We completed a 467,000 square foot lease renewal for Snap, the anchor client in the park for 10 years, and purchased the 45% interest in the asset we didn't own for $38 million, which represents pricing of $395 per square foot and a 9% initial cap rate on a fee simple basis based on market assumptions for land value. Lastly, in conjunction with the Santa Monica Business Park buyout, BXP purchased a 29% interest in 360 Park Avenue South for $1, bringing our ownership interest in the asset to 71%. 360 Park Avenue South is a 450,000 square foot office building that BXP is fully redeveloping in Midtown South and is encumbered by a $220 million mortgage. We purchased 360 Park Avenue South using OP units priced at $111 per share in 2021 and subsequently introduced two financial joint venture partners, who secured their interest by funding the required redevelopment capital expenditures over time. At the time of closing, the selling joint venture partner had funded $71 million, and BXP assumed their remaining $46 million projected funding obligation. This investment represents pricing projected at building stabilization in 2026 of $754 per square foot and a 7.2% initial yield on cost. So in summary, for these three acquisitions, BXP invested only $48 million upfront and materially increased its ownership position in three high-quality assets we understand well. We expect to receive projected total returns that will be well in excess of the cost of the equity capital we've raised from the Binney Street joint ventures, and project FFO per share accretion from the investments of approximately $0.14 in 2024. Regarding the broader private equity capital markets, office sales volume picked up in the fourth quarter to $14.4 billion, up 126% from the prior quarter and up 14% from a year ago. Interestingly, office sales went from 12% of total real estate transaction volume in the third quarter to over 27% last quarter.  Though U.S. lenders continue to reduce exposure to office real estate, making secured financing extremely difficult to arrange, there is more distressed asset restructuring activity, more capitulation on pricing by owners and more confidence by buyers in their forecast cost of capital. The Fed's announcement late last year that interest rate hikes are likely over and cuts could start to occur in 2024 is very favorable for real estate capital market conditions. There were a few comparable premier workplace transactions completed last quarter other than our Binney Street joint ventures. One Westside and Westside Two in West L.A. sold for $700 million or over $1,000 a square foot, and a 6% cap rate to a user, but the economics are influenced by a lease buyout from the existing anchor tenant. Now turning to BXP's priorities for 2024. Our overriding goal is to leverage our competitive advantages to preserve and build FFO per share over time. Today, the key advantages for BXP are our commitment to the office asset class and our clients, as many competitors disinvest in the sector, a strong balance sheet with access to capital and the unsecured debt and private equity markets and one of the highest quality portfolios of premier workplaces in the U.S. assembled over several decades of intentional acquisitions and development. Our primary focus for 2024 will be leasing, preserving and building overtime our occupancy in addressing near and in some cases, medium-term lease expirations, with our portfolio 88% occupied, leasing vacant space is our least capital-intensive way to build back FFO. Doug will focus his comments on leasing markets and our expectations for leasing this year. A second focus for 2024 is new investment activity, many office owners are facing existential risks, given slow leasing and limited secured financing and many institutional owners want to diversify away from the office asset class. We said last quarter, we intended to shift to offense on capital deployment and this has started, given the three new investments I described. There are and will be significant additional investment opportunities available from both lenders and owners of property. Our focus will remain in our core markets on premier workplaces, life science assets and residential development. During the last market downturn caused by the global financial crisis, BXP was able to acquire premier workplaces such as the GM building, 200 Clarendon Street, 100 Federal Street and 510 Madison, all at attractive prices at the time. A third area of focus for us this year will be new development, we have two possibly three residential development opportunities under control that are being entitled and designed and we intend to raise joint venture equity capital for these projects in the second half of the year. We also continue to have dialogue with anchor clients for sites under control in Manhattan, though the discussions are in early phases and the outcomes are much less certain. Significant pre-leasing, higher expected development yields and joint venture equity would be required to launch any new premier workplace developments. We also have several specific sites and buildings that we are trying to re-entitle in advance for near-term viable use based on market conditions. BXP continues to execute a significant development pipeline with 10 office, lab, retail and residential projects underway. These projects aggregate approximately 2.7 million square feet and $2.4 billion of BXP investment, with $750 million remaining to be funded after closing the 290 Binney Street joint venture and are projected to generate attractive yields in the aggregate upon delivery. We will be opportunistic with dispositions in 2024. Market conditions are generally unfavorable for selling assets at attractive prices, but we are interested in raising capital through asset sales if favorable opportunities present themselves. To summarize, in the face of strong negative market sentiment, BXP executed well in 2023, leasing over 4 million square feet of space, raising over $4 billion of capital and launching 2 large-scale fully pre-leased life science developments. We displayed resilience with stable occupancy and a stable dividend and our FFO per share is higher today than it was before the pandemic started in 2020. So we start the year with continued challenges in the leasing market, BXP is well positioned to gain market share in both assets and clients during this time of market dislocation. As a last closing remark, today represents a BXP milestone, this will be Bob Pester's last earnings call as he is retiring from BXP next month, after more than 25 years of service. Our San Francisco region grew significantly under Bob's capable leadership. Thank you very much, Bob. You will be missed by all of us at BXP. Over to Doug. Douglas Linde : Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. After a moment of silence to Bob, I'm going to start. In early 2023, we established our baseline leasing expectations for our portfolio of about 3 million square feet in flat occupancy. As Owen commented, we ended the year with 4.2 million square feet and the fourth quarter included our 467,000 square foot early renewal with Snap at Santa Monica Business Park. We executed about 500,000 square feet more than we expected in 2023 and it was primarily pulling forward some 2024 transactions. The Snap lease was part of our baseline expectations and interestingly, it was only 1 of 2 leases in excess of 130,000 square feet that we executed in the portfolio during the year. On 12/31/22, so over -- just over a year ago, our in-service occupancy was 88.6% and we finished the year, 12/31/23, at 88.4%, essentially flat. Our in-service portfolio is 49 million square feet, so 20 basis points amounts to 98,000 square feet sort of a rounding era. Maintaining portfolio occupancy in the current environment is an accomplishment in its own right. Our large lease expirations in 2024 are 200,000 square feet at 680 Folsom, 230,000 square feet at 7 Times Square, where we own 55% and 230,000 square feet at Carnegie Center and they all occur in the first half of the year. A few comments on WeWork. We are actively engaged in lease modification discussions at our 4 units, Dock 72 in Brooklyn and our 3 sites in San Francisco. Our occupancy expectations assume, we reach agreements that result in a smaller overall footprint and a reduction to the $33 million of rent they are currently paying. It is obvious that WeWork emerges from bankruptcy as an operating business that is positioned for success. Mike will discuss the impacts in his same-store property performance for 2024. In '23, the U.S. office [ph] markets experienced negative leasing absorption. This included the BXP coastal cities, as well as the major Sunbelt and Midwest markets, basically everywhere. How are we thinking about the broad market for '24? If you look at the most recent labor statistics, while the U.S. added 216,000 jobs in December, only 5% were categorized as professional and business services, a.k.a. true office using jobs. The pace of job reductions related to the slowdown in the business economy has slowed, but we continue to see employee layoff announcements across a wide variety of industries, particularly technology. The U.S. economy may not enter a technical recession, but no one should assume that the soft landing is going to stimulate a pickup in office-using employment. Operating in this macro environment, it's hard to envision any dramatic pickup in market leasing absorption in '24. We think overall earnings growth for our clients and potential clients will improve and are optimistic it will lead to employment and space additions just not right away. However, we're not counting on a market recovery to maintain BXP's occupancy. Our leasing, construction and property management teams will lean in on our operating prowess to gain new clients and market share, as clients choose premier properties that are in sound financial conditions for their workplaces. This is how we release known explorations and cover vacant space. The bifurcation of client demand between the East Coast and the West Coast continues to be very wide. San Francisco, West L.A. and Seattle are dependent on technology employers. Traditional technology demand growth continues to be weak and more times than not renewing technology clients are reducing their lease premises. Snap is a case in point. We were successful in executing a forward-starting 10-year lease extension commencing in '26 for 467,000 square feet. However, the transaction does include an early termination of 140,000 square feet at 12/31 24. We can't require clients to lease more space, but we can meet their workplace needs. The leasing excitement on the West Coast in '23 was all about growth from AI organizations in the city of San Francisco, where we saw over 1 million square feet of positive absorption from the industry in the San Francisco CBD in '23. There have been billions of dollars of recent investment in this growing ecosystem, and there are additional clients in the market, but let's acknowledge that, these other AI organizations are predominantly seed or early round funded entities and not at the same scale as an OpenAI or an Anthropic. Their leasing is focused on small footprint built opportunities that are available at significantly discounted terms relative to rents being achieved in Premier. However, all demand is good demand in San Francisco if it translates into absorption. The Seattle CBD continues to have very little active demand other than lease exploration-driven exploration. Our vacancy in Seattle increased by about 100,000 square feet in the second half of '23, due to WeWorks termination, as well as the give back of a floor from a technology company as part of a 5-floor lease extension at Madison Center again, technology-company staying with us in our portfolio, but reducing some space. The entertainment industry, union contract settlements are clearly a positive for West L.A., but there continues to be pressure from streaming profitability, industry consolidation and job reduction in the gaming and media space that is impacting overall demand growth. The concentration of the strongest user demand, which will be the source of occupancy pickup, is still broadly speaking, asset managers, including private equity, venture hedge funds and specialized fund managers and their financial and legal advisers. These organizations are the heart and soul of our New York City activity and are an important sector of the Boston and San Francisco CBD demand as well. In some instances, these clients are growing their teams and capital under management, but in many cases or in all cases, they want to occupy premier workplaces. To illustrate the point, during the quarter, we completed a 25,000 square expansion for an investment bank in Manhattan, a 17,000 square foot lease with a foreign bank that's relocating to one of our other properties in Manhattan, a 10,000 square foot lease with a venture capital firm that's relocating to Embarcadero Center, a 30,000 square foot renewal with a private equity firm at Embarcadero Center, a 74,000 square foot renewal with a law firm in Embarcadero Center and a 15,000 square foot renewal with a long-only manager in Boston. This is where the demand is going to come from. Our strongest activity remains in our Midtown Manhattan portfolio, the Back Bay of Boston, the urban cores of Reston Town Center in Northern Virginia and our Embarcadero Center assets in San Francisco. This quarter, we executed leases of about 74 transactions. We signed 37 lease renewals, 37 leases with new tenants. There were 8 contractions and 9 expansions among our existing clients, with a net reduction of about 100,000 square feet across those 17 transactions. If you exclude Snap, the number is actually a positive 40,000 square feet. The bulk of the transactions were on the West Coast and the majority of the expansions were in New York City. Total leasing volume this quarter was led by New York at 567,000 square feet, then 468,000 in L.A., 198,000 in San Francisco, 153,000 in Boston and 140,000 square feet in the greater Washington, DC area. I would highlight two leases that were executed this quarter. First, the Pratt Institute entered into a long-term lease for 63,000 square feet at Dock 72, a real accomplishment for the New York team and DoorDash executed 115,000 square foot lease, including 57,000 square feet of expansion at 200 Fifth Avenue, again, in Manhattan. The mark-to-market of the leases that commenced this quarter, meaning they hit our revenue, was flat as reported in our supplemental. The overall mark-to-market of the starting cash rents on leases executed this quarter, relative to the previous in-place cash rents was down 1.8%. The starting cash rents on leases we signed this quarter on second-generation space were up 7.5% in Boston, flat in New York, down 15% in D.C. and overall on the West Coast down 3%, but the San Francisco CBD was still up 9%. At the end of the quarter, we had signed leases that had yet to commence on our in-service vacancy, totalling approximately 750,000 square feet, with 625,000 square feet anticipated to commence in '24. Our pipeline of active leases under negotiation sits at just under 1 million square feet today. We have only one transaction currently in negotiation over 70,000 square feet. Comparing this to last quarter, we were at 1.2 million square feet of active discussions at the same time and included the 467,000 square foot Snapdeal. We've seen an uptick in the number of active deals, but the size is smaller. For modelling purposes, our 2024 leasing activity is anticipated to be about 3.5 million square feet. As of January 1st, 2022, so going back two years, our total expirations for '24 totalled 3.5 million square feet. On January 1st, 2024, we have 2.7 million square feet of current expected expirations. If we renew 25% of the remaining 2024 expirations or 675,000 square feet, it means we will have renewed about 43% of our expiring square footage, which is sort of in line with our historical averages. We have executed leases on 625,000 square feet of vacant space commencing in '24. So effectively, we need about 1.4 million square feet of leases that we have yet to execute on 2024 vacant space to have a rent commencement during the year to maintain a flat occupancy. That's what is built into the model and into Mike's same-store. As we look forward into the year 2024, we expect to have sticky occupancy defined as 20 basis points plus to minus 120 basis points negative at the year, and that also factors in some tenant defaults in addition to contractual expirations.  During the year, we will have property additions and subtractions to the portfolio. These are not included in the current portfolio occupancy guidance. As an example, in the fourth quarter of '24, the two Waltham Life Science developments will join the in-service portfolio. Their 32% leased and include 300,000 square feet of vacant space that will hit the reported vacancy, that's not part of our projections. We're just looking at our intra-service portfolio as of today. And as long as we're on the topic of life science leasing, new life science activity across our two markets as well as our entire portfolio, continues to be light. During the quarter, we actually had 137,000 square foot known exploration of a life science lease in our Waltham portfolio, which impacted our sequential occupancy and there were no new leases signed in South San Francisco at 651 Gateway. In Waltham, we are seeing some tour activity and have made some proposals, but potential clients don't feel a sense of urgency to make a quick decision. Before Mike discusses our 2024 guidance, I want to make one additional comment around the cost of potential new developments that Owen described. We are seeing more competitive pricing in tenant improvement projects. We've not experienced deflation in material prices or labor, but it's true that there is less work, and we believe that this has resulted in lower pricing from the various subcontractors, who want to maintain a certain size of business. As we think about new base building construction costs, we're hopeful that escalation is no longer part of the conversation and that the same pressures will result in bids that allow us to consider moving forward. However, there are lots of infrastructure projects as well as institutional construction that is filling a portion of the void from lower commercial construction in our markets. Capital costs still haven't received. Construction financing requires a significant capital charge for lenders and obviously results in a higher margin on top of the underlying SOFR. Everyone has a view on the timing and depth of Fed Red rate cuts, but if SOFR goes to 4%, construction financing, if you can arrange it, it's still going to be very expensive and a significant drag on new construction starts. Current market rents and concessions associated with available existing space don't support office -- new office development. To a potential client that requests a proposal for new construction understands it will involve appropriate lease economics to justify the new capital requirements. So Mike, it's time to talk about the quarter and guidance for '24. Michael LaBelle : Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. So this morning, I plan to cover the details of the fourth quarter and our full year 2023 performance, but I'm going to spend most of our time describing our 2024 initial earnings guidance that was included in our press release, with additional details in our supplemental financial package. So for 2023, we reported full year FFO of $7.28 per share and that was $0.02 per share of the midpoint of our guidance range provided last quarter and $0.01 above Street consensus. Owen described the strong 1.5 million square feet of leasing activity in the quarter, and included in this is 270,000 square feet within our unconsolidated joint venture portfolio, where we generate leasing commissions that exceeded our budget by $0.02 per share. We also outperformed our guidance for the quarter with $0.02 per share of lower net interest expense. There were two real reasons for that. Last quarter, we announced the closing of our $600 million five-year floating rate mortgage on three of our Cambridge buildings. When interest rates rallied in December, we opportunistically hedged this financing to fix the rate at 6% for the term. This reduced our interest rate by 160 basis points, contributing to lower interest expense in the quarter.  Additionally, the closing of the sale of a 45% interest in 300 Binney Street raised $213 million of equity. That transaction closed earlier than we expected, so the interest earned on the cash represents an increase to our net interest guidance. These two items were offset by about $0.02 per share of onetime unbudgeted transaction expenses related to the forming of the joint venture for 290 and 300 Binney Street as well as slightly higher G&A costs in the quarter. Our portfolio NOI performed in line with our expectations, though we did experience a shift from the same property income bucket to termination income. We booked $10 million of termination income in the quarter, which was $7 million higher than our assumption, primarily from WeWork terminating its lease for two floors in Madison Center in Seattle. Our practice is to exclude termination income from our same property results. So the impact caused our same-property growth to be slightly negative for the quarter. If you exclude the impact of the termination income, our same-property performance actually would have been roughly flat. So with that, I'm going to turn to our 2024 guidance. On a high level, our 2024 guidance can be summarized as follows. We project growth from the delivery of development and the acquisitions of our partners share in Santa Monica Business Park and 901 New York Avenue, a slight decrease in our same-property portfolio NOI compared to 2023, higher net interest expense due to the persistency of the current high interest rate environment and lower development and management services fee income. I'm going to start with the impact of the acquisitions of our partner's interest in Santa Monica Business Park and 901 New York Avenue that Owen described. 360 Park is still in development, so that transaction has limited impact on 2024 FFO. There are a lot of moving pieces with these transactions from an income and balance sheet perspective, so bear with me for a moment. Including the impact of the incremental debt acquired as well as the loss of fee income earned from our former partners, we project these acquisitions are highly accretive, adding approximately $25 million or $0.14 per share to our 2024 FFO. Noncash components represent about 50% of the incremental FFO pickup and are derived from straight lining the leases and fair valuing the debt and the ground lease at Santa Monica Business Park. If we break that down into the categories for our guidance assumptions, the incremental property NOI is approximately $0.22 per share, and that's offset by the additional interest expense of $0.05 per share and the loss of fee income of $0.03 per share. We will now be consolidating the results from these properties. So starting in 2024, you will see the increase in our consolidated NOI and interest expense and a decrease in FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures and fee income. Also impacting 2024 is the disposition of Metropolitan Square in Washington, D.C. that we transacted last year. Inclusive of interest expense, the transaction is neutral to our 2024 FFO. But we do expect a reduction in property NOI of $0.03 per share, that's offset by a comparable $0.03 per share reduction in interest expense. Turning to development activity. Our development activity includes $550 million of investments that delivered in 2023 and will contribute incremental growth for a full year in 2024. These include 2100 Penn, 140 Kendrick Street and 751 Gateway that are in aggregate 97% leased. We have an additional $665 million in developments that are projected to deliver in the near term that we expect will commence revenue in 2024, but be much more meaningful to our growth in 2025 as they complete their lease-up. In aggregate, we expect our developments to contribute an incremental $35 million to $42 million in 2024 or $0.20 to $0.24 per share. Turning to the same property portfolio. Doug spent time describing our occupancy outlook and the impact of the uncertain economic environment that our clients are dealing with. Most continue to be very cautious around new investments, including space, and our leasing projections reflect this conservatism. We still expect to have a productive leasing year. And as Doug described, we have a large backlog of signed leases and leases and negotiation that will go into occupancy in 2024. We expect an occupancy range for our in-service portfolio of 87.2% to 88.6%. Overall, our assumption for 2024 same-property NOI growth from 2023 is negative 1% to negative 3%. As Doug mentioned, we're in discussions with WeWork on modifications for the remaining four leases. Our guidance assumes -- our guidance includes assumptions for these modifications that comprise 45 basis points of the decrease in our projected same-property NOI performance. As you all should expect, our interest expense will be higher in 2024 with the continued high interest rate environment. We expect floating rates will start to drop in the back half of the year and are modelling 75 basis points of Fed cuts, which is more conservative than the current forward SOFR curve. Currently, floating rate debt is only 5% of our total debt, is comprised of $730 million of mortgages, and we have a $1.2 billion term loan that's currently fixed and the interest rate swap expires in May of 2024. Our liquidity is very strong. We have current cash balances of $1.5 billion and our entire $1.8 billion line of credit is available. We will be using approximately $700 million of cash to redeem our maturing 3.8% $700 million unsecured bond that expires tomorrow. Other than that, we have no meaningful 2024 debt maturities without extension provisions, so we're not projecting significant changes in our debt profile. Our only external funding need is approximately $600 million of development spend in 2024 that will be funded with available cash. The majority of the increase in interest expense is coming from our 2023 refinancing activity, resulting in a roll up to market interest rates and the consolidation of the mortgage threat for Santa Monica Business Park and 901 New York Avenue. And lastly, as I mentioned last quarter, our average cash balance will be less in 2024 than it was in 2023, and we expect approximately $30 million of lower interest income. So overall, we're projecting net interest expense of $570 million to $590 million in 2024. We expect consolidated net interest expense to be higher by $72 million at the midpoint, inclusive of the drop in interest income I mentioned. With the consolidation of SMBP and 901 New York Avenue, the interest expense and our unconsolidated joint venture portfolio is expected to be $18 million lower. So this results in a projected increase from year-to-year in total interest expense, including our joint ventures of $54 million or $0.31 per share at the midpoint of our guidance range over 2023. Additionally, the consolidation of Santa Monica Business Park requires us to fair value the above-market ground lease, we project a $10 million positive non-cash impact to FFO from this in 2024. The last item I would like to cover is our fee income projection. We have or will be delivering several joint venture development projects, including our Gateway joint ventures, 360 Park and the Skymark Residential Development. With the delivery of these projects, our development fees are expected to be lower by about $5 million in 2024. Also, we're no longer receiving fees of about $5 million from Santa Monica and 901 New York Avenue, now that they are wholly owned. So our guidance for fee income is lower and is now $25 million to $28 million in 2024. So if you aggregate all of these assumptions, we're providing an initial 2024 FFO guidance range of $7 to $7.20 per share. At the midpoint of our guidance, that's $0.18 per share lower than our 2023 reported FFO. The difference is comprised of increases of $0.19 of incremental NOI from acquisitions and dispositions, $0.22 from our developments, $0.02 of lower G&A expense, offset by $0.26 of higher interest and fair value ground lease amortization, $0.21 of lower contribution from Same Property NOI, $0.08 of lower fee income and $0.06 of lower termination income. At the midpoint, our 2024 FFO results in a modest 2.5% decline from 2023. So despite the economic headwinds, we continue to gain market share with our leasing and operating prowess and premier workplace portfolio, demonstrating relative stability in times of negative absorption. We're optimistic that the interest rate environment will settle at a lower level, providing more confidence in the economy. We're also successfully executing on accretive new investments and continue to focus on additional opportunities to grow our earnings and create shareholder value. That completes our formal remarks. Operator, can you open the line for questions? Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions]. And I show our first question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Good morning. Appreciate all the detail. I guess, Doug, I wanted to maybe circle back on the 1.4 million that you talked about. I think that's kind of the effectively the new leasing number that you need to hit this year. And I think you said you've got some things in the pipeline. But how do we think about that number at unfolding over the course of the year? And I guess, at what point of the year do those leases need to be signed in order to take effect to hit the occupancy target that you're looking for this year? Douglas Linde : So that's, unfortunately, the technical question that keeps everybody up at night here at BXP, which is what will the actual condition of the space fee that we're leasing and what will our requirements be to either modify or change the space relative to simply handing the space over to the tenant? And I wish I could give you a precise answer to that, Steve. Right now, of the -- just over 1 million square feet of space that we are currently under negotiation with, about 500,000 of that is covering what I would refer to as pure vacancy. And I think there is a good probability that 50-plus percent of that will be \"in place\" from a revenue perspective in 2024 -- but it's -- that's the really hard question for us to gauge, which is, I'm comfortable that we're going to get the leasing done and that when we are also showing our \"occupancy\", including signed leases, that it will illustrate that we have had a very successful year from a leasing perspective. It's really hard to know when that revenue is going to hit. And so that's the variable that we can't control because it's really a question of how the lease comes together. And all of that is embroiled into Mike's same-store number. So that's why I think, to be fair, we are being, I think, conservative but they're conservative, not trying to -- we're not standing backing anything here because we just don't know. Steve Sakwa : Thank you. Operator : And so our next question comes from the line of John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. John Kim : Thank you. On your joint venture acquisitions, two of them were centered around major lease extensions. Was that timing related to your partners exit, because they no longer wanted to fund the future CapEx? Or did the signing of those leases really provide valuations for your partners to exit? And what does this mean for your other assets that you co-own with CPPIB and your other selling target? Owen Thomas : Yes. Yes, as I said in my remarks, the lease extensions did spark the acquisitions that we made. And it's for the reasons that you outlined. So with each of these extensions came a capital requirement for tenant work, leasing commissions and, in some cases, building upgrades. And the two partners had a shift in strategy to disinvest or reallocate away from office. And that basically sparked the acquisitions. The other thing I would point out, other assets had future capital requirements as well. So in the case of Santa Monica Business Park, we have the Snap renewal, but also we have a fee purchase option coming up in 2028. That could -- if we elect to purchase the fee, that will have a capital requirement. And those 360 Park Avenue South, there was not an anchor lease renewal because that project is under redevelopment. It's in the middle of the redevelopment. So the partner basically sold out their position in the middle of funding that development. So it also had a future funding requirements. So those are really the drivers. Douglas Linde : Yes. And John, I would just say the following, which is there are institutional investors who have just had a perspective that at this moment in time, investing additional capital in our sector is not what they want to do, relative to their portfolios. We obviously have a very different perspective on the long-term value that's going to be created by doing these transactions or we wouldn't be doing them. So we're excited about the lease that we signed with Snap. We're excited about the lease we signed with Finnegan Henderson. And we're excited about what that means for the long-term value of these properties. And it was the disconnect between what they wanted to do and what we wanted to do that really created the opportunity from our perspective to deploy capital in a very accretive way. And we're looking for other opportunities in our portfolio and away from our portfolio, where these types of disconnects between the current owner and what our perspective is they're different. Owen Thomas : Yes. And just lastly, John, to the second question that you asked, never say never. There might be other opportunities to acquire interest in properties that we own, but I certainly don't think the volume would be anything like what we experienced in the last quarter. For example, today, our largest joint venture partner is Norges. And in the last quarter, they actually increased their number of joint ventures with us because we did these two major JVs in Cambridge. And obviously, they have a different strategy from the JV partners that we acquired interest from. So it could be more, but I don't think it will be anything close to the volume that we experienced last quarter. John Kim : Thank you. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Alexander Goldfarb : Hi, good morning. And first, Bob Pester, congrats on retirement. I guess now we can all look for Rod's steady hand. Just, Owen, and Doug, just I guess a two-parter following up on John Kim's questions. One, obviously, is the debt side of the equation, looking what your expectations are for potential debt resolution, where Boston may be able to pay off debt at cents on the dollar. And two, as you look at these JV buyouts, is it purely that the partners, whether the existing or potential ones in the future, just don't want to put in capital or is it that they view the investment of that capital to be highly risky, whereas you guys seem quite confident in your returns? And just trying to understand if it's a capital issue that your partners just want to know more versus a risk of investment decision? Owen Thomas : Yes. I think the -- Alex, to answer your question on the debt side, Mike should answer. But in general, as you know, we primarily finance with unsecured financing, and we have great access to that market and have been accessing it and we think it's very attractive. And in most cases, we've been able to extend or refinance existing mortgages that we have on our joint ventures. Look, I think in terms of the answer to your question, the JV partners would have to answer it in terms of how they thought about the returns that they were forecasting from the extensions that we committed to. But when we do our own math, and we shared some of it with you on this call, we think it's very attractive and it's very accretive to our company, and we think it makes a lot of sense. So our suspicion, as a result, is that these decisions that they made were more related to a change in strategy as opposed to a lack of enthusiasm for the return. I'd also just make an additional point on this. These are two different partners, and they come from a little bit different position. So the partner on 901 has been a long-term investor in that project, and they have been in it, and they have made a good return and has been very successful for them. So maybe it was a change in strategy, but it also might have been, look, we've been in this for a very long period of time. We've done fine. Maybe this would be a good time to exit. I think on the partner on the other two deals, Santa Monica Business Park and 360, definitely, they were newer to the JVs, and I think that clearly was more of a change in strategy. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Nicholas Yulico : Thank you. I was hoping to just get a little bit more feel for the decision to reinvest in Santa Monica Business Park. Why you think it's still an attractive long-term opportunity? And secondly, if you could just give us any feel for -- in terms of the Snap renewal, how the mark-to-market worked on that plus the level of TIs and free rent if you had to give there? Owen Thomas : Yes. So I'll turn it over to Mike for the second question. But in terms of the first question, I mentioned the yield that we bought this and the per foot that we bought the asset on a fee simple basis, we think that's very attractive pricing. We were able to derisk the asset materially through the extension of the anchor tenant, which leases 400-plus thousand square feet of the 1.2 million square feet. And also, we think that Santa Monica Business Park is a very interesting redevelopment opportunity for our company, and we're in the process of commencing that redevelopment process. And we think over a long period of time, it's going to be a very accretive asset to our company. So we are excited about the asset. Douglas Linde : Yes. And Nick, this is Doug. On your answer to the other question. Without -- we're not going to get into the specifics of a particular tenants economics. As I said in my remarks, our West Coast leases that were signed this quarter -- executed this quarter was down 3%, but San Francisco was up 9%. So you can go through the statistics and sort of decide yourself how you think that might have played out. And relative to transaction costs in free rent, it was actually a very low transaction costs and low free rent early renewals. So those economics were built into the lease rate. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Anthony Paolone from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Anthony Paolone : Thanks, good morning. You talked about playing offense and it sounds like you'll use some third-party capital as you've done in the past. But just for BXP's portion of deals and playing offense, where do you think we see capital come from for you all? Owen Thomas : Well, as you said, as I mentioned in my remarks, I do think there will be opportunities that will present themselves for the company this coming year. And as you said, we will -- the joint venture partner more than likely using third-party capital, and we will be using our balance sheet to fund our joint venture interest in whatever we come up with. But it's -- again, we are receiving inquiries. We are looking at things, but we're not, I would say, advanced in anything at this time. But if we look at what we think will happen in 2024 versus illiquidity in the market in 2023, I think activity will be greater this coming year. Michael LaBelle : And I would just add that a lot of what we're looking at is doing things more on a capital-light basis, and taking a lower percentage interest percentage potentially or entering assets in a different way and kind of similar to these transactions that we did, and this didn't require a lot of incremental capital. We took on a little bit, obviously, their share of the debt, but the overall impact on our leverage was very, very small with these transactions. And in fact, we've kind of delevered overall because we brought in the equity from the Cambridge transaction. Overall, we deleverage. We're -- we don't expect that we're going to increase our leverage significantly. And our goal is to kind of maintain it in a range that is pretty close to where we are. So I think that when we think about investments, we keep that in mind. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith from UBS. Please go ahead. Michael Goldsmith : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. We've talked a little bit about San Francisco, and there's some clear differences in the markets. Do you think we're kind of hitting the bottom in these tech markets that are lagging in their portfolio? And just any visibility from the demand from AI or other sources that are providing some near-term excitement for a rebound in San Francisco and Seattle? Douglas Linde : I would say, Michael, that the technology demand on the West Coast is lower than we would like it to be, largely because there have been a significant amount of technology layoffs over the past, call it, 12 to 18 months, and they're still happening. Clearly, they're happening at a much lower rate and they're on the margin. So I would tell you that I think we've been sort of in the \"bottom\" for a period of time. And I don't look at the world and say that there's another \u201cshoe to drop\u201d, I think we're just sort of in a portion of time where there's just no interest in growth from a real estate space perspective for technology companies. I believe that will change. The fourth quarter and the third quarter of 2023 in San Francisco for AI was a great quarter, and we had 2 really interesting transactions occur, which we've described previously. There was 1 million square feet of positive absorption. I'm not smart enough to know if those 2 tenants may double or triple or quadruple over the next 2 to 3 years. I also don't know whether or not there are going to be other AI companies that are either BC or seed invested with angel investing that are going to explode. I'm hopeful that those types of things will happen. And from our perspective, that will all be to the good for the West Coast and for the city of San Francisco. 2024 is not going to be that year in terms of, in our view, space absorption. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Griffin from Citi. Please go ahead. Nick Joseph : It's actually Nick Joseph here with Michael. Owen and Doug, you guys have touched on the opportunities expected this year and with some institutional owners, maybe change in strategy or lowering exposure. I guess on the other side, are you seeing more competition for some of these potential deals? Are you seeing people actually looking either distressed opportunities or other opportunistic opportunities looking to actually add exposure to office? And then how are you thinking about actually underwriting the deals, just given the current environment? Owen Thomas : Yes. So Nick. Good morning, so there have been more office transactions in the fourth quarter. In my remarks, I gave some stats, and it was kind of interesting to me the percentage of the commercial real estate transactions that are going on from office increased materially in the fourth quarter to the third. So what's happening? I think there are more distressed players that are out there, buying assets at very low per square foot prices. Some of these assets are challenged physically, most of them are not very well leased. And I think those buyers are family offices, for example, they're smaller deals that don't need leverage. Because again, getting a secured mortgage for an office building is virtually impossible. And I think these buyers are just saying, look at this per square foot price, we think the market will ultimately recover, and we're in at a good basis. So I think that's the kind of market that's out there. Those aren't the kind of deals that we want to do. I mean we're looking for premier workplaces. We're looking for assets. They may not be fully leased. Maybe there are some challenges with it or an asset that we can make a premier workplace, and they're going to be larger and they're going to probably require funding from the financing market in some way. And I think there's much less competition for anything like that. And I think, hence, that's BXP's opportunity. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley. Ronald Kamdem : Hopefully, you can hear me. Just one, 2-parter, one on the same-store NOI guidance of down 2%. Just hoping a little bit more color. You talked about WeWork being a 45 basis point headwind. Just could you talk through maybe what some of the larger expirations that you're expecting in the first half the impact will be and what you're assuming at the top and bottom end of the guidance range? And the second part, if I could sneak it in, is just on the life science market, as you sit here today versus 3 to 6 months ago, can you just characterize what the leasing activity is like for the larger versus the sort of mid and smaller tenants? Thanks. Michael LaBelle : So I'll start with that on the same-store question, which is really related to kind of the trends in our occupancy that we expect. So we gave the range of that. And our anticipation is the first half of the year has some of these larger expirations, there's one in New York City. There's one in Carney Center and then there's one in San Francisco, and Doug kind of described how big they were. And then the leasing that we have signed that are going into vacant space is more spread across. So my expectation is that you're going to see occupancy decline a little bit in the first couple of quarters, and then it's going to build back up through the year. And that's what's built kind of into our guidance ranges. And then obviously, our boundaries are kind of the upper and lower boundaries of what that year-end occupancy range that we provided is that Doug talked about. So that's kind of how we build that range. And I think that pretty much answers your question, Nick. Douglas Linde : Yes. And let me add on Rod deal go first on life science activity in the San Francisco -- South San Francisco, North Peninsula market and then Bryan can talk about life science activity in our Waltham portfolio, which is where obviously where our availability is. Rod, do you want to start? Rodney Diehl : I would just say that relative to 6 months ago, at least in the Bay Area, I would say the life science demand is about what it had been, which is that it's not with the larger users. There have been some smaller tenants. That's how we were able to land the 3 deals at our 651 Gateway project. Those are single-floor tenants roughly 22,000 each. So in that section of the demand, we're still seeing a little bit of activity, but not so much on the larger groups. So relative to 6 months ago, I think it's probably about the same. Bryan Koop : Boston, this is Bryan Koop. It really reflects the same thing. The second half of last year was far different than the first, and activity picked up on life science tours. But let's say, from summer beginning, smaller users out there still questioning, is it time to make a commitment or not? A lot of questions about their funding, etcetera. And then fourth quarter, we did see a couple of, let's say, the life science titans come out and emerge. And they were all caught let's say, potential clients that are in the market already in Cambridge that were, let's say, looking, sourcing the Waltham market for what could be available. In general, we just had a summary with Doug and Owen yesterday about last year's performance. And we were quite surprised. We have 360 tours last year. So you're averaging 7 a week, which was surprising, given how dismal the attitude about office was. Two comments. One is that the clients are spending far more time with us and aggressively looking for what their strategy is going forward. And we have also seen verification of possible spoke plays, where you have a large headquarters in the CBD district and then looking for a spoke location further closer to the suburbs to people's homes. And we've had 2 great executions of that and there's been a lot of interest in that. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Caitlin Burrows : Hi, everyone. Maybe just a question. Google announced last night meaningful office optimization charges, 1.2 billion in the quarter. So given your 2.8% exposure to the tenant, will this impact any of your properties? And I guess, more broadly, I think you mentioned that tenant defaults are included in your guidance. So what's your watch list like or outlook for early exits by tenants this year? Douglas Linde : With regards to your first question about Google, the answer is absolutely not. We have -- Google is in only one asset of ours, which is in our Cambridge portfolio and they're in there for a long, long time, and they're actively using their space and talking to us about increasing parking needs and things like that. So we have no sense that there's any change in their portfolio composition at least with us at BXP. I would say most of our defaults have been in the life science and they've been in the sort of start-up tech world, and we have 1 in Waltham, that's probably going to occur and we have 2 or 3 that occurred in the latter parts of 2023 on the West Coast, 1 CBD and 2 in the suburban market, and they're all sort of in this 20,000 to 25,000 square feet of piece, and they're just part of the -- what's going on in the economy with regards to capital formation, where VCs want to put their money, where they don't want to put their money, whether technologies are successfully getting companies to the point where they can raise additional capital again and we have some exposure to that, but it's not significant. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Camille Bonnel from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Camille Bonnel : Good morning. On the 6 projects that are scheduled to be stabilized in 2025 and have started or are starting initial occupancy this year, how far along are the leasing prospects on those buildings? And how much do these development prospects represent in the active leases under negotiation pipeline? Douglas Linde : So Mike is pulling out which ones theoretically are... Michael LaBelle : 180, 103. Douglas Linde : So the developments that we have, I believe that you're referring to are 290 Binney Street, which is the 2026. That's AstraZeneca, that's 100% list [ph] 103 Fourth Avenue, which we don't have any leasing velocity on. 180 CityPoint, where we have about 140,000 square feet of available space. Those 2 are coming online in '24 in terms of when they're going to be in service. And we need to find some clients to lease those buildings in order for them to be stabilized in 2025. At 651 Gateway, it's a similar conversation, in that we've started doing leasing. We will be through 12 months of the lease-up in early 2025, and we need to do more leasing in order to get that one going in the 360 Park Avenue South, which -- where the building construction is complete and Hilary and her team in New York are aggressively pursuing anybody who wants premier space in the Midtown South market, where we've done one lease, and we have another lease that we're close to having a letter of intent on for a floor plus. And then there's other interest in the building. And that one also we need to do additional leasing in order for it to be stabilized in 2025. The rest of the -- I believe the rest of the stuff is residential, and that's obviously a question of when those buildings start and how long the ramp-up is in terms of turning over the units and I think when Skymark opens, which is the Reston property in the third quarter of 2024, we have probably a 15- to 18-month lease-up. I know you can correct me if I'm wrong, in or for that one to be stabilized. Owen Thomas : No, those are both correct. And that also has, as you know, 75,000 square feet of office and then some ancillary retail. And we're working on a couple of deals for the retail space. And we've got, I would say, a real prospect for about half of the office space that we're speaking to, but not at LOI stage with at this point in time. Michael LaBelle : So Camille, that was really in my notes, I kind of described that the deliveries in '24 are these deliveries we're talking about. And we don't expect '24 to have a really significant impact from those, but we do expect to have some leasing momentum in '24, with income starting in '25. So our expectation is that that's when we will start to see more revenue come from these buildings. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck from Wells Fargo. Blaine Heck : Great, thanks. So it seems like we're still seeing the flight to quality trend play out with most net absorption and leasing activity taking place at high-quality buildings with high rents. But recent media reports have tried to kind of poke holes and even the top of the office market. So just wanted to get your thoughts on whether anything has changed with respect to leasing activity or rents at the top of the market and whether you've noticed that tenants have maybe become more cost conscious and less likely to lease at those highest quality spaces? Owen Thomas : I would tell you -- I didn't go through it this quarter because we had so much other stuff to go through. But the premier workplace data that I generally provide on this call shows accelerating distancing between premier workplaces and the rest of the market from a vacancy, net absorption and rental perspective. So at least at a high level, the trend to premier workplace continues to run unabated. Douglas Linde : And I would tell you that the most activity that we are having on a building-by-building basis is, in fact, in our CBD most premier assets. And in no case, are we seeing changes in the economics of what the market or we are asking for and ultimately achieving in those client conversations. I'm not sure where that information that was in the article in the Wall Street Journal came from, but it's just -- and I'll let Hilary describe what's going on in Manhattan in terms of our activity level, which I think is sort of the poster trial for Premier. And she can sort of give you a perspective on why I think that article is just not -- it doesn't hold water for us. Hilary Spann : Thanks, Doug. Yes. So we have seen consistently since, at least 2019, gains in occupancy in Midtown Manhattan for Premier workplace, with corresponding declines in occupancy for non-Premier workplaces. And the same is true in terms of rental rate gains for Premier Workplaces in Midtown Manhattan. So while you might expect, given the weakness in some of the overall office statistics to sort of affect the Premier Workplace, in fact, the opposite is true. And at present, the vacancy rate for Premier Workplaces is hovering just around 10%, which we consider stabilization levels for Midtown Manhattan. And although the capital markets environments are not constructive for new development, that is generally the point in the market at which you would start to see people interested in building new products. So if you think about the availability of high-quality space in Midtown, there are only 3 available spaces in the Park Avenue submarket of 250,000 square feet or greater. One of them has a lease out on it. So if you are a tenant of size and you're looking for premier space in Midtown, it simply is very, very hard to find and getting harder. And that drives pricing, obviously. So we feel very, very good about our Midtown portfolio. And we think that rents will continue to improve across the board for Premier Workplace in New York. Douglas Linde : And then just -- Jake, you might comment on the phenomenon you're seeing at the high end -- in the premier buildings where, I guess, what we would refer to in Washington, D.C. as the trophy buildings in terms of both the demand and the economics there. Jake Stroman : Sure. I will just sort of tack on to what Hilary had noted in Washington, D.C. We continue to see a significant sort of material outperformance for trophy class assets and repositioned assets in our market. There's an incredible amount of leasing velocity that we see at those assets, relative to what we see across the rest of the market being commodity space. So we've achieved a lot of leasing success in a lot of our premier assets in downtown Washington and continue to see a lot of traffic. Douglas Linde : We're seeing the same thing in Boston. And as noted in our discussions internally this last week, for our Boston portfolio, we're at 4.4% vacancy and Cambridge is 2.5, which is just phenomenal. We are seeing -- I wouldn't say that this is outstanding trend, but we are seeing users that normally would not be in our office building, where they want more square footage in, let's say, a Class B or C building, looking to us for reaching up with smaller square footage just used more efficiently. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Upal Rana from KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Upal Rana : Hi, good morning. The D.C. market seems to be a bright spot, given the JV acquisition of 901 and the lease extension as well as the increase in occupancy there. Do you see the strength that is sustainable? Or could you provide your thoughts on the D.C. market in general? Thanks. Douglas Linde : So I would tell you that the D.C. market is the most -- one of the most interesting markets from our perspective in the sense that there are more, what I would refer to as over finance buildings with institutional owners that are no longer interested in providing capital to those assets, which is manifesting itself in an inability for lease transactions to occur in those transactions. And Jake and his team are, I would say, highlighting our financial stability and the things that we are doing in our buildings. And there is no question that the lease transaction that he just pulled off with Finnegan Henderson was a direct result of the lack of opportunities for a large tenant to go to other existing buildings, the inability of any new construction to commence and BXP's ability to both provide TI capital as well as figure out a way to reposition that building to be as close to a brand-new trophy building as you possibly can have. And Jake, you might just sort of describe the choices that are out there and how the distress in the market is impacting our ability to transact. Jake Stroman : Yes, sure. I can just -- Doug, to that point, if we look at 901 New York Avenue as an example, in the last 30 months, we've done 140,000 square feet, plus or minus, of transactions at that asset. And we've had great activity. And I think a lot of that is because we've been incredibly responsive to the clients in the market. And I think people have been responsive to our sponsorship at the asset. So we feel really comfortable with the plus or minus 100,000 square feet of vacancy at the asset, given the repositioning program that we're going to undergo. And so we're really excited because these repositioned assets and investing this new capital into remonetizing the ground floor plane of the building and sort of really repositioning the lobby experiences, it really drives the activity of that asset, and it really becomes a new building in the market. And so there are fewer and fewer of those opportunities available in downtown Washington. And ever since news of the transaction that Doug noted was completed, we've seen great activity already and continue to at 901. And it's just representative of the fact that there aren't a lot of great opportunities in Washington, D.C. that exist today for premier office or repositioned office. Michael LaBelle : The one other thing I would add is the performance of Reston Town Center. I mean again, the majority of our portfolio in the Greater Washington areas and Reston Town Center. And Reston is 94% leased, and we've had positive absorption there. In this past quarter, we did a 60,000 square foot new lease with a technology company coming from another place into Reston Town Center. Again, because it is such high quality kind of a live work play kind of place, and these clients really, really value that. So we're outperforming from a rental rate perspective, and we're seeing positive absorption there. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Peter Abramowitz from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Peter Abramowitz : Thank you. I think Owen mentioned there's an early termination option for part of the Snap extension at Santa Monica Business Park. Just curious how that's kind of factoring into your conversations with the lender ahead of the loan maturity in 2025. And wondering just how to think around parameters for pricing as you start to have those conversations? Douglas Linde : This is Doug. There is no termination option on the lease that we just signed. As part of the lease, we allowed them to terminate on 140,000 square feet at the end of 2024. The remaining 467,000 square feet is going out for 10 years starting in 2026 to 2036. So Mike can describe any conversations that we've had with the lender, but we're very comfortable with the refinancing opportunity associated with that building and how that will play out, relative to both the new leasing that we hope to do as well as the potential purchase of the ground, which is -- can occur in 2028. Michael LaBelle : And Peter, the loan is with a syndicate of banks who are relationship banks of ours. It does expire in 2025. And I'm confident that those banks will be supportive of us, and we will likely extend that loan for, I would say, a bridge period that will get us through the purchase of the ground lease. And after the purchase of the ground lease, because it's an above-market ground lease, there will be an improvement to the economics of the asset and we would probably do a longer-term refinancing after that or focus on a portion of the part that might be redeveloped, and then we could split it into a portion that is going to stay as is for a while in a portion where we might do a kind of mixed-use redevelopment. Douglas Linde : And now that it's effectively a wholly owned joint venture, we have no partner. We don't need to use third-party financing. We can choose to use unsecured financing. So I mean there are lots of options. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Dylan Burzinski from Green Street. Dylan Burzinski : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess just appreciate the comments on potential acquisition opportunities in the future. But could you just talk about sort of how maybe your co-investment partners are viewing office today and sort of the return threshold needed for them to deploy capital to the sector? Owen Thomas : Yeah. I think it's a mix. As we've just described some partners that are trying to reallocate away from office. And -- but there are others that are interested, they're intrigued. I think they see the same opportunity that we do. You know that \u2013 you know there is the all of these negative sentiment about office is creeping into the premier workplace segment, which doesn't deserve it, given all of the color that we just gave you on this call. And I think there are investors, who have capital that see that and are interested in co-investing with us. And so in terms of pricing, I think it's to be determined. I think it depends a lot on the building, leasing status and what exactly the issues are. There's no doubt that pricing has changed. And we demonstrated what some of those changes are with the deals we did last quarter. Operator : Thank you. And I show our last question comes from the line of Floris Van Dijkum from Compass Point LLC. Please go ahead. Floris Van Dijkum : Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. I guess following up on the last question a little bit, Owen, maybe I'd love to get your thoughts on cap rates, and what is happening in office? And when could we see, in your opinion, the stabilization of cap rates? It appears that clearly, the Santa Monica deal at a 9% cap rate, that would be probably 200 basis points north of where it was maybe 18, 24 months ago. Maybe talk specifically about your view on what's happening to cap rates in some of your key markets like New York, San Francisco, Boston, D.C. or L.A. And what -- and at what point would you -- where do cap rates need to be for you to actually deploy more capital? Owen Thomas : Floris, you're asking a very good but unanswerable question, and I'll explain why. We tried. I try every quarter to give all of you comparable market deals. So we all understand together what pricing is. And this quarter, I could not come up with one. The only one was the deal in West L.A., but it had a lease buyout, and I'm not sure it was per se, a comparable deal. We gave you some data on partner buyouts that we did. Each one of those deals have different facts. For example, the Santa Monica deal was an unlevered fee simple cap rate. Well, that's got an assumption in there about Land Valley. So how accurate and how usable is that cap rate, I don't know. But we did just give you 3 cap rates on deals in New York, West L.A. and Washington, D.C. on partners that we bought out. So that is some data. And then lastly, in terms of what would be interesting to us, we pay attention to what is the look through cap rate for BXP and what would be accretive to us. And today, I think that number is around 7.5%. And we need to -- if we're going to do things that need to accrete our earnings. And so we're going to be focused on that, look through cap rate as a guidepost for what we do. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas, Chairman and CEO for closing remarks. Owen Thomas : I can't imagine you all want to hear any more remarks from us. So I thank you for your patience. This is a complicated quarter. We got through a lot of data. And again, thank you for your time and interest in BXP. Operator : Thank you, sir. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

We ask that those of you participating in the Q&A portion of the call to please limit yourself to one question. If you have any additional query or follow-up, please feel free to rejoin the queue. I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks. Owen Thomas : Thank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. BXP's performance in the first quarter continued to defy the negative market sentiment for the commercial office sector. Our FFO per share was in line with our forecast and market consensus for the first quarter.  We completed just under 900,000 square feet of leasing, which is 35% greater than the first quarter of '23 when we leased 660,000 square feet. And this is a more relevant comparison than to the fourth quarter of '23, given elevated leasing activity associated with the quarter at year-end.  Our weighted average lease term on leases signed this past quarter was also notable at 11.6 years in comparison the leases we signed in 2023 at a weighted average lease term of 8.2 years. Our occupancy remains stable. We closed the previously announced joint venture with Norges at 290 Binney Street, our lab development in Cambridge that is fully leased to AstraZeneca.  This transaction mitigates $534 million of development funding for BXP by raising property level equity for the company on attractive terms.  Now moving to macro market conditions. The 2 most important external factors impacting BXP's performance or long-term interest rates and corporate earnings growth. Lower interest rates would improve our cost of capital, spark more transaction activity and investment opportunities in our sector, reduce the cost of new development and be a tailwind for our clients' earnings growth. Much has been written and forecasted about the trajectory of interest rates, which we believe will come down over time, but we can only speculate on the exact timing. Companies generally do not hire new employees and increase their office space requirements unless their earnings are growing. Over time, the S&P 500 earnings grow around 10% per year. But in 2023, that growth rate was 0%. And in 2022, it was 5%. Though the U.S. economy is growing and unemployment remains low, only about 7% of the jobs created are in office-using categories versus a long-term average of over 25%. S&P 500 earnings are projected to grow 11% to 13% per annum over the next 2 years, which should be constructive to BXP's leasing activity.  Many technology clients, a critically important sector driving space demand post the global financial crisis overcommitted to space during the pandemic and are currently in a digestion process, which has curtailed demand. There are exceptions such as net demand for space from the AI sector in San Francisco. Over the long term, we expect many tech companies will experience strong earnings growth and return to requiring more office space. Premier Workplace is defined as the best 6% of buildings representing 13% of total space in our 5 CBD markets continue to materially outperform the broader market. Direct vacancy for Premier Workplaces is 11.2% versus 17.9% for the broader market.  Likewise, net absorption for Premier Workplaces has been a positive 7 million square feet over the last 13 quarters versus a negative 30 million square feet for the broader market. Asking rents for Premier Workplaces are 50% higher than the broader market, a widening gap from prior quarters. This outperformance is evident in BXP's portfolio, where 89% of our NOI comes from assets located in CBDs that are predominantly premier workplaces. These CBD assets are 91% occupied and 93% leased as of the end of the first quarter.  Regarding the real estate private equity capital markets, office sales volume in the first quarter was down was $8.7 billion, down 3% from the prior quarter and up 32% from a low base 1 year ago. Office sales as a percentage of total commercial real estate transaction volume are continue to rise to over 20%. Transaction activity for premier workplaces was very limited.  BXP's overriding goal is to leverage our competitive advantages to preserve and build FFO per share over time. The key advantages for BXP are our commitment to the office asset class and our clients as many competitors disinvest in the sector, a strong balance sheet with access to capital in the secured and unsecured debt and private equity markets, and one of the highest quality portfolios of premier workplaces in the U.S. assembled over several decades of intentional development acquisitions and dispositions. Today, clients and their advisers are more focused than ever on building quality as well as the financial stability and long-term commitment of their building owners, all strong competitive advantages for BXP. Last quarter, I spoke about 3 priorities for BXP in 2024, leasing space, new investments and development. Now Doug will provide more details on leasing. We're off to a good start in the first quarter and see a growing pipeline of opportunities for later this year in 2025. On new investment activity, as you know, we pivoted to offense late last year and early this year through buying joint venture interest in 3 significant in-service assets at attractive prices. We remain in active pursuit of opportunities in our core markets and asset types with primarily 2 types of counterparties. Lenders to highly leveraged assets that require recapitalization and institutional owners seeking to diversify from the office asset plan.  To date, there has been limited market transaction activity for high-quality office assets. With lenders, there are fewer premier workplaces that are struggling with leverage. And in the few cases involving premier workplaces, lenders are generally electing borrowers who agreed to invest modestly in their assets.  Institutional owners are less interested in selling their highest quality assets, and there remains a material bid-ask spread given assets have, in most cases, not been marked down to market clearing levels. Notwithstanding these current challenges, our expectations are the transactions and our investment activity will increase in coming quarters given the volume of maturing financings, continued markdowns in institutional portfolios and higher for longer interest rates.  We also have interest from institutional investors in contesting with us for select opportunities. On development, we commenced our 121 Broadway residential tower in Kendall Center as part of the 1 million square feet of commercial entitlements we received from the city of Cambridge to build 290 Binney Street and a future to-be-determined commercial building. Comprising 37 stories and 439 units, 121 Broadway will be the tallest building in Cambridge with a state-of-the-art design and amenity setting a new quality standard for residential offerings in the Kendall Square neighborhood.  Earlier this month, on Boston Marathon weekend, we celebrated the grand opening for and delivered into service the 118,000 square foot Dick's House of Sports store on Boylston Street at Prudential Center. We continue to push forward with several residential projects under control that are being entitled and designed for which we intend to raise joint venture equity capital in the second half of the year. For office development, we have been approached by multiple clients in all our core markets who are interested in occupying new space and anchoring development projects. Given escalated material labor and capital costs, anchor clients must pay a premium to market rent today to justify the launch of a new development project, which is a challenging dynamic exacerbated by the earnings growth issue previously described. Though BXP's new office development activity has slowed, there will also be a very limited new office -- that will also be very limited new office development for the foreseeable future in our core markets, which is favorable for our existing portfolio. As vacancies continue to decline for premier workplaces, rents should rise, which will ultimately bridge the economic gap to justify new development. Though we believe buying is a better opportunity than selling in the current market environment, we are interested in raising capital through asset sales if attractive opportunities present themselves. We have a handful of small dispositions defined as under $30 million we are currently exploring.  BXP continues to execute a significant development pipeline with 11 office lab retail and residential projects underway as of the end of the first quarter. These projects aggregate approximately 3.2 million square feet and $2.4 billion of BXP investment with $1.3 billion remaining to be funded and are projected to generate attractive yields in the aggregate upon delivery. So to summarize, in the face of strong negative market sentiment, BXP continues to display resilience and stability and occupancy FFO and dividend level. BXP is well positioned to continue to gain market share in both assets and clients during this time of market dislocation. The prospect of lower interest rates and stronger corporate earnings also provides a backdrop for renewed growth. Let me turn the call over to Doug. Douglas Linde : Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. I hope what you're going to hear today from me is you're going to be with a pretty constructive perspective on what's going on in our markets and what's going on with our revenue picture and our leasing picture. As we sit here at the end of the first quarter, in spite of the absence of a broad pickup in office-using jobs, BXP continues to lease space. We are leasing space. There's momentum in the economy despite persistent high interest rates.  Overall earnings growth for our clients and potential clients appears to be improving, and we're pretty optimistic it's going to lead to employment and space additions. And while we are not going to see broad reports of shrinking availability across any market, until there is a pickup in white collar job formation, there are pockets of supply constrained in select submarkets where we are seeing competition for space and improving economics. As reported in our supplemental, the mark-to-market of the leases that commenced this quarter was up 7% and the transaction costs averaged $8.60 per year, which is lower than it's been in the last few quarters. The overall mark-to-market of the starting cash rents on leases executed this quarter relative to the previous in-place cash rent was up about 2%. The starting cash rents on leases we signed this quarter on second-generation space, we're up about 22% in Boston, down 6.5% in Manhattan, down 3% in D.C. and up 8% on the West Coast with San Francisco CBD up 12%. Boston's increased is in large part due to a replacement of a tenant that was in default and had stopped paying. Adjusting for the transaction, the Boston numbers would have been up about 6%. As Owen stated, the seasonal trend line of BXP's leasing activity in the first quarter of '24 picked up relative to what we experienced in the first quarter of '23. This quarter, we completed 61 transactions, 32 new leases for 494,000 square feet and 29 renewals encompassing 399,000 square feet. We had 3 expansions totaling 18,000 square feet and 4 contractions totaling 44,000 square feet. As a point of comparison, in the first quarter of '23, there were 57 leases, 29 leases were with new clients for 410,000 and 28 renewals for 250,000. There were 10 expansions and 3 contractions. Last quarter, Fourth quarter of '23, we signed 37 lease renewals and 37 leases with new clients, and there were 8 contractions and 9 expansions among our existing clients.  This quarter, new leases encompass 55% of the volume. Activity was across the entire portfolio with 178,000 square feet in Boston, 225,000 square feet in the New York region, 154,000 square feet from the West Coast and D.C. lead attack with 336,000 square feet. And to give you some additional color on this activity, there was only 1 transaction greater than 60,000 square feet due to the 215,000 square feet long-term law firm extension that included a 25,000 square foot contraction in D.C. although that same law firm took an additional 7,600 square feet in our Reston portfolio.  Princeton made up 38% of the New York activity this quarter, almost all new clients. New clients made up 90% of the leasing volume in Boston and in New York, while renewals captured 73% of the West Coast and D.C. market. Equally important is our pipeline. Post March 31, we have over 875,000 square feet of active leases under negotiation, which we define as a transaction that is being documented by our legal teams and some of these transactions have been completed. This is consistent with the level of in-process leases we've made for the last few quarters.  These transactions include a multifloor expansion of an asset manager in our Midtown portfolio in New York, a full floor expansion by a law firm in Midtown, an asset manager taking a full floor 360 Park Avenue South, consumer brand company relocating to a building in Waltham, a multi-floor renewal of a law firm in San Francisco with no change in the premises and a downsizing along with an extension of a technology company in Reston, Virginia and a similar transaction in Waltham. We have seen an uptick in the number of active deals. At the end of the quarter, we had signed leases that had yet to commence on the in-service vacancy, totaling approximately 817,000 square feet, which includes 624,000 square feet that is anticipated to commence in 2024. We also have signed leases with new clients for another 534,000 square feet of currently occupied states. These leases have yet to commence but they are reflected in the reduction of our rollover exposure shown in our supplemental. The strongest user demand continues to come from the asset managers, including private equity venture hedge funds, specialized fund managers and their financial and legal advisers. These organizations are the heart and soul of our New York and our Back Bay activity and are an important driver of our San Francisco CBD demand. In some instances, these clients are growing their teams and capital under management. But in all cases, they want to occupy premier workplaces.  We continue to see significantly more client demand in our East Coast portfolio versus the West Coast due to the disproportionate concentration of technology and media content related demand on the West Coast. However, there have been some subtle and encouraging trends across much of the portfolio. Our Back Bay Boston and Park Avenue Centric New York City portfolio continue to have outsized demand relative to our availability. While concessions are still at elevated levels, we've been able to increase our taking rents and we actually have clients that we cannot accommodate due to a lack of available space in certain buildings.  In the last 90 days, there is the strong pickup of client activity in our Urban Edge Waltham portfolio. We have an 80,000 square foot tech client expiring in 2024 with a planted downsize to 16,000 square feet. This quarter, we completed a lease for 45,000 square feet and are in negotiations with 2 other clients, new ones for another 37,000 square feet of that expiration, and the existing client will stay with us but relocate within the building. Additionally, in a different Urban Edge building, we're negotiating a 45,000 square foot lease with an existing subtenant to extend when their prime lease expires in '25. We're negotiating a 25,000 square foot lease with a lab user proportion of our availability on Second Avenue and we're negotiating a 55,000 square foot lease with a nontech company in a different building. None of these transactions more than 220,000 square feet were in our pipeline on 12/31/2023. All of this occurred in the last 90 to 120 days.  In the District of Columbia and Northern Virginia, we continue to see more buildings with over leveraged capital structures unwilling to provide capital for new transactions, and therefore, they have very little client interest. At the other end of the spectrum, when the market got wind of our lease extension at 901 New York Avenue and the anticipated enhancements that we are planning, the interest in the available space at New York -- 901 New York accelerated dramatically. Reston continues to house the largest concentration of our Washington regional portfolio. It's the headquarters for VW, [ Batel ], Leidos, SAIC, Peraton, [ Kaki ], Metron, Comscore, Mandiant and the College Board and it's also the home to a number of large technology companies like Microsoft.  Because of the environment of the Town Center with 7 days a week food, beverage and shopping and is also a natural location for small businesses in the financial services and legal industries. This quarter, we completed a 58,000 square foot lease with a new technology client at Reston Next that's moving from a toll road building, an expansion for law firm, and we are seeing a pickup in small tenant activity relate to [ '23 ] and as well as large users looking to upgrade their premises. The AI organizations in the city of San Francisco continue to look for additional space, which will continue the positive absorption story. They continue to focus, however, on build and expensive space. And while there is an abundance of available space in the city, there continues to be outsized demand for view-spaced north of market relative to the available supply. We completed a 35,000 square foot lease with a boutique financial adviser at Embarcadero Center this quarter that was only interested in view spaced north of market. We're negotiating 6 transactions with new clients totaling 40,000 square feet as well as an 80,000 square foot renewal with a law firm that's retaining their existing point. Today, the Seattle CBD is almost exclusively a lease expiration-driven market, and there has been a material pickup in the level of activity. The number of tenant tours that we have conducted has picked up in the last 2 quarters. We completed a lease with a new client on a 10,000 square-foot prebuilt suite and are in negotiations with a law firm for a parcel floor and discussions with a technology company for a full floor.  West L.A, however, continues to be the market where activity remains light. While Century City is seeing great demand and strong rents as financial and professional services firms head west from the downtown market, those clients are not yet prepared to take space in low-rise buildings in Santa Monica. There continues to be pressure from streaming profitability, industry consolidation and job reduction in the gaming and media space that is impacting overall demand growth in the West L.A. area.  As we forecast during our last call, our occupancies declined also slightly from 88.4% to 88.2% during the quarter, with a known expiration of 230,000 square feet in Princeton, where, as I mentioned, we have signed 80,000 square feet of new client deals this quarter that will commence this year. We have 2 additional large lease expirations across the portfolio in '24 that will occur during the second quarter, 200,000 square feet at 680 Folsom in San Francisco and 230,000 square feet at 7 Times Square, where we own 55%. Occupancy will drop in the second quarter and recover as we move into the fourth quarter. Mike is going to spend some time discussing changes to our interest expense outlook in his remarks. The issue of the day is the level of inflation, and I thought I'd make a few brief comments on how inflation is impacting our business. We are not seeing any deflation in our base building costs as we build -- as we bid potential stick-frame residential the projects Owen was describing earlier, but escalation assumptions are now normalized. No more 8% to 9%.  The changes to the building in energy codes, along with the elevated level of interest expense associated with any construction financing, continue to pressure project costs and make new starts very challenging. However, we are seeing costs come down on tenant improvement jobs, which is a reflection of reduced demand on the group of contractors and subcontractors that focus on interiors work who are looking to maintain a consistent book of business. New high-rise tower construction costs are unlikely to deflate in the longer-term interest rate environment and the long-term interest rates remain at the elevated levels, the longer it's going to be before we see market rents approach the levels necessary to rationalize new office building, leasing economics and corresponding new development. We are experiencing an operating environment where leasing available space is primarily driven by gaining market share. That's with the world that we are living in, and we're winning. As clients choose premier properties in sound financial condition, operated by the best property management teams, BXP will continue to be successful in doing just that. I'll stop there and turn it over to Mike. Michael LaBelle : Great. Thank you, Doug. I appreciate it. Good morning, everybody. This morning, I plan to cover the details of our first quarter performance and also the updates to our 2024 full year guidance. We've also been active in the debt markets this quarter. So I'm going to start with a summary of some of the changes in our debt structure. In early February, we paid off $700 million of unsecured notes with available cash, that was in line with our plan. We also entered into a $500 million unsecured commercial paper program. This program offers an additional market for us to tap beyond the bank market mortgage and unsecured bond markets that we currently actively utilize. We started issuing under the program last week, and we've raised the full $500 million for terms ranging from overnight to 1 month at a weighted average rate of SOFR plus 25 basis points. The all-in rate, including fees is approximately 5.75%. We've used the proceeds to pay down our term loan from $1.2 billion to $700 million, which will reduce our borrowing cost on $500 million by 75 basis points or about $0.01 per share in 2024. In addition, we increased our corporate line of credit by $185 million to $2 billion. Our banks continue to be strong supporters of BXP even as they evaluate their global commercial real estate exposure and exit certain relationships.  Now I'd like to turn to our first quarter earnings results. Despite the difficult real estate operating conditions and the stagnant office using job growth statistics, our portfolio is demonstrating strength and stability. As Owen and Doug described, portfolio occupancy has been relatively steady for the past 6 quarters. Our revenues continue to grow with top line total revenue up again this quarter by $10 million or 1.3%, and our share of portfolio NOI is also higher, up $6 million or 1.2% from last quarter. High interest rates are our biggest earnings challenge. This quarter, our interest expense increased $7 million. It's important to point out that more than half of this increase was due to higher noncash fair value interest expense, related to below-market debt on our recent acquisitions.  We reported funds from operation of $1.73 per share for the quarter that was in line with our guidance for the first quarter and it was equal to our first quarter FFO from 1 year ago, again, demonstrating the stability of our income statement. Portfolio NOI exceeded our expectations by about $0.02 per share. The majority of this is from lower-than-anticipated net operating expenses that we expect will be deferred to later in 2024. This was offset by higher-than-projected net interest expense of $0.02 per share primarily from higher noncash fair value interest expense related to the acquisitions, and we also booked lower-than-projected interest income due to changes in the timing of closing our 290 Binney Street joint venture.  So moving to the full year. Since providing our initial 2024 guidance, we finalized the assumptions utilized in valuing the in-place debt and interest rate swaps for our 901 New York Avenue and Santa Monica Business Park acquisitions. For 901 New York Avenue, we increased our assumption for the interest rate on the debt by 70 basis points to 7.7%. And for the interest rate hedge at Santa Monica Business Park, we determined that the change in market value will be amortized through our interest expense for the remaining term of the loan that expires in 2025. These adjustments result in an additional $0.05 per share of noncash fair value interest expense in 2024 relative to the estimate we used when we provided our guidance last quarter. This noncash adjustment impacts our full year guidance and is the primary reason we have reduced our FFO guidance for 2024. Other interest expense assumptions have also been impacted by the changing expectations for rate cuts in 2024. Last quarter, we forecasted 4 rate cuts commencing in the second quarter which was actually conservative to market expectations at the time. We've now pushed out any rate cuts to late in 2024. The impact on our floating rate debt is partially offset by the lower cost of our commercial paper program, but overall, we expect $0.02 of dilution from higher short-term interest rates compared to our prior guidance.  The operating assumptions for the portfolio occupancy and same-store NOI remain relatively unchanged from our prior forecast. As Doug described, we do expect occupancy to decline slightly this quarter, we did expect occupancy to decline slightly this quarter and in the second quarter before improving in the back half of the year.  Our assumption for same-property NOI growth of negative 1% to 3% is unchanged. Other modifications to our guidance include reducing our assumption for 2024 G&A expense by $0.01 per share and a modest reduction in our fee income projection. So in summary, we are reducing and narrowing our 2024 full year guidance for FFO to $6.98 to $7.10 per share. This represents a reduction of $0.06 per share at the midpoint from our prior guidance.  The primary reasons for the reductions are $0.05 of higher noncash fair value interest expense and $0.02 of higher interest expense from higher short-term interest rates, offset by $0.01 of lower G&A expense. The last item I would like to mention is that we published our 2023 sustainability and impact report, and it can be found on our website. The report contains a wealth of information on our sustainability efforts and the progress towards achieving our critical goals of reducing our energy use intensity, carbon emissions and achieving net 0 carbon operations for Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2025.  We invite you to join us for our sustainability and impact webcast on May 15. If you have not received an invitation, please reach out to Helen and our Investor Relations team. That completes our formal remarks. Operator, can you open up the line for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And I show our first question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Nicholas Yulico : Yes, I guess just a bigger picture question maybe for Owen. How you're thinking about all the different opportunities out there? You mentioned that there could be some acquisition opportunities. You did just launch 121 Broadway, which is a substantial capital commitment. You have a stock price, I'm sure maybe you're not happy about.  And so I'm just trying to understand like how we should think about the investment focus right now for the company? And how you expect to fund that via -- or are you looking to issue equity? Would you buy back stock? Anything along those lines would be helpful. Owen Thomas : Yes. So Nick, a couple of things I would say. First, let me start with 121 Broadway. It's a fantastic new building -- residential building that we're building in Cambridge but it was also launched as part of the requirements to achieve 1 million square feet of commercial entitlements in Cambridge. It was a requirement of that of receiving those entitlements. And those entitlements allowed us to commence the 290 Binney Street development, and we still have FAR available for 1 or 2 additional commercial buildings. But again, you have to think about that development. It's tied into the 290 development that we commenced last year. In terms of new investment opportunities, as I described in my remarks, there's a tremendous amount of dislocation going on in the office sector. You've got lots of overleveraged assets and you have also a number of institutional owners that want to decrease their exposure to office. And this is going to create opportunities for us. When we look back at prior down cycles in real estate and in office real estate, those were periods of time where BXP significantly enhanced its portfolio with acquisitions like 200 Clarendon Street GM building and others. So we want to participate. We think that's going to happen again in this cycle, and we want to participate in it. And as we do that, we are paying very close attention to, obviously, accreting our earnings over time and also watching our leverage. And I think each transaction will have to stay on its own in terms of how we fund it. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Doug, I guess I wanted to just maybe follow up on your positive commentary on leasing and just maybe get a sense for how much of this is for the existing portfolio? How much of this is for the development pipeline? And I realize we're getting sort of close to the middle of the year. So any of the leases being signed are probably really more of a '25 beneficiary than they are going to be at '24. But just how do you think about building up the occupancy on the existing portfolio and as importantly, filling up the vacancy within the development pipeline? Douglas Linde : Yes. Thanks, Steve. So of the activity that we have in our pipeline, and I'm going to give you 2 different sort of pipeline numbers. So the 875,000 square feet of stuff that we have going on, about 20,000 square feet of that is development and the rest of it, the other 865,000 square feet -- 855,000 square feet are all existing portfolio deals and the majority of it is on available existing space. So the world, as I sort of think about it is we have the leases that we signed this quarter, then we have our pipeline of stuff in process. And then I have -- what I have is sort of my tracking list and my tracking list right now has another 1.7 million square feet of deals that we are -- that are active in our teams across the regions. And these are not a tenant is looking at the market and might call us. These are paper is moving back and forth. And there is a legitimate opportunity potentially for a deal to occur.  Again, on all of that, it's almost exclusively on our in-service portfolio. So if you think about our development pipeline today, it really consists of 360 Park Avenue South and Hilary can comment on activity there and then the life science buildings that we have in Waltham, of which there's no active conversation going on that's part of my pipeline and then the building that we have in our joint venture in South San Francisco. And again, there's nothing really going on there as well. And so the vast majority of the activity that we have is about increasing -- first, maintaining and then increasing, albeit slowly the occupancy in the existing in-service BXP core portfolio. And Hilary, if you want to comment on 360 Park Avenue self. Hilary Spann : Sure. Thanks, Doug. Steve, in terms of the leasing activity in Midtown South, I think we saw a slowdown in the first part of this year. I will say that we are starting to see more activity as 360 Park Avenue South has come online and clients can actually see the very high quality of the finishes and the lobbies and the common areas and the amenities that we've put in place. And so we are starting to see a pickup in our activity there.  It remains the case that the businesses that are interested in locating at 360 Park Avenue self span across industry sectors. And so while Midtown South in general has historically been home to tech and media tenancies, we're seeing everything from corporate to financial services and as Doug mentioned, an asset management firm come into that building and show interest in occupying that building. I think, anecdotally, while the leasing activity is picking up a bit, it remains to be seen where that will settle out in terms of executed leases in the coming quarters, but we feel encouraged by the fact that the volume of interest in the building has stepped up meaningfully since we completed it and opened it. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Anthony Paolone from JPMorgan. Anthony Paolone : I guess my question is, you mentioned earlier some demand from the AI space. And at the same time, just tech companies having overexpanded and shedding some space. Just wondering if you could put some more dimensions around how that nets out. Exactly how big is the AI demand and maybe perhaps, how much more is there to go before the rest of tech is rightsized? Douglas Linde : Yes. So I'm going to give you what I would refer to as a simplistic view of it, and I'll let Rod Diehl give you a more comprehensive view. So the simplistic view of it is on the East Coast, where there really isn't much in the way of incremental AI demand, net-net, most technology companies are when they're renewing a lease, taking less space.  On the West Coast, predominantly in the greater San Francisco marketplace and then skewing down into the CBD of San Francisco, there is more incremental absorption overall in technology. It's all coming from AI. And I would say it's taking the place of what were traditional technology companies. But Rod, you can go sort of plus that on a little bit more. Rodney Diehl : Yes. Thanks, Doug. So yes, last year, of course, was a big year for AI in San Francisco. There was 2 very large leases that were completed. I believe that made up about 27% of the overall leasing activity for the year, which was pretty substantial. So coming into '24, there's still been activity on the AI front. There's one of those larger tenants that did the deal last year is also in the market again for more space. So we're watching that closely to see where that goes. So I think it's definitely a bright spot. And these different companies often to find themselves as AI, but it's broad across the spectrum of that technology. As you see that down in the Silicon Valley, in fact, there are some AI companies, many of them which are tied into the automotive industry. We have a couple of them in our own portfolio, and some of those are in the market as well. So definitely a consistent point of additional optimism and demand for the Bay Area. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : You've been making a very compelling case between -- the bifurcation between premier workspace and commodity office in the CBD portfolio, which really benefits BXP. But that same bifurcation exists in your portfolio between CBD and suburban, where it's a 15 percentage point occupancy gap. So I'm wondering, just given that performance difference, does that make you reconsider your commitment to the suburbs? Douglas Linde : So this is -- let me start. This is Doug, and I'll let [indiscernible] make a comment as well. We are committed to the geographic locations that we currently have occupancy and vacancy. The truth of the matter is that the majority of our availability is in suburban, part of it was self-inflicted. So part of it was during 2020 to 2022 when we were looking at the highest and best use for some of our Waltham suburban assets in our Lexington suburban assets. We deem that the value of those assets over the long term is life science facilities would be better than as \"traditional office facilities. And so we effectively cleared out some buildings. So 1050 Winter Street is an example and Reservoir Place and the other big colony buildings which are where the predominant amount of our availability is we're effectively cleared out for those purposes. And unfortunately, the market has not been helpful to us. And so we're managing that availability. But quite frankly, we've had the opportunity to lease some of that space to office companies and we've made the decision, at least in one case that we think we're better off holding off that building and doing it in a life science building when the appropriate economic model makes sense, aka we have a tenant that wants to pay the right rent for that building. Then our other large availability is in Princeton, and our Princeton portfolio is premier property defined by the other assets in the greater Princeton area. And we are -- we have probably on an activity level more activity in Princeton right now than we do anywhere else in our New York portfolio on a relative basis. I can't explain why the pickup has occurred during the first and the second quarters of 2024, but it has.  It's predominantly associated with the pharmaceutical and life science industries, but not lab. It's companies that are in that business that are -- that have an SG&A function. And Hilary, you can comment on the Princeton market and I'll let Bryan comment on the Waltham market. Hilary Spann : Sure. Thanks, Doug. As Doug said, we've seen an incredible pickup in leasing activity in the Princeton market in the first and second quarters while -- and that includes signed leases, but also leasing activity that continues now and we expect to be executed in the second and third quarters. A lot of it, as referenced, is new activities. Some of it includes clients that exist in the portfolio of Carnegie Center today and who have expressed needs to expand both from consolidation of business units or expansion of lines of business and from an increased experience of return to office ,and so it's a pretty diverse set of reasons that people are expanding. But to Doug's point, the campus is pretty highly concentrated with pharmaceuticals and in particular, foreign pharmaceuticals, and that is where the bulk of the demand is coming from. And so we're incredibly encouraged by the amount of leasing activity, and we expect to see additional signed leases coming out of it in the coming quarters. Bryan Koop : This is Bryan Koop for Waltham. I'll continue to echo what Doug talked about, and we intentionally call it an Urban Edge market because it is less than 10 miles from downtown Boston, and that's an attribute that shouldn't be taken lightly in terms of the commute and also the density of the population surrounding that Waltham market.  Some further color on what Doug brought up. We are seeing a difference between our -- the east side of I-95, which is all the attributes of urban project and maybe for the analysts who are very familiar with this, attributes that we have in Reston, taller buildings, more amenities, et cetera. And we continue to see access and the highway is going to improve there. We put a new ramp in last year, and there is a forecast for more there. Where we are seeing some weaknesses in those assets that Doug mentioned like the Bay Colony, which have attributes that are very similar to the conventional suburban office buildings spread out feels more rural, but actually the location is very close. That's where there is a little bit of weakness. But we continue to believe that Waltham is an urban edge market and quite different than the conventional suburbs that most real estate people would describe. Operator : And so our next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck from Wells Fargo. Blaine Heck : Just following up on an earlier question and maybe taking out the element of timing on occupancy, and just focusing on the lease rate this year and potential progression there. You talked about the large exploration still remaining at 680 Folsom and 7 Times Square. But when you think about those in conjunction with your leasing pipeline, which Doug you said was 875,000 square feet plus and Owens' characterization of the pipeline is growing in the back half of the year and into 2025. I guess how much do you think you can move the lease rate up by as you look towards the end of the year? Douglas Linde : So when you use the word lease rate, you're talking about occupancy rate, right, not economic rent rate, I'm assuming. So again, I think that it's going to be slow and steady. So our projections when we gave our guidance during the call in the first quarter was that we were going to hopefully be flat to where we ended 2023 at the end of 2024 and then we'll continue to make additional progress.  And then if you look at our exploration schedules, they're pretty manageable, right? I mean we have 5% to 6% expiring every year for the next 4 or 5 or 6 years. And so we don't -- we need to lease space. We need to gain market share, which is, again, my sort of point. And we are gaining market share in our markets, but it's -- when we do have technology companies expiring, we have to fight that water coming at us. And so it's challenge to dramatically increase occupancy in the short term. But we are getting to the point where we believe occupancy will continue to moderate upwards. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith from UBS. Michael Goldsmith : What are the economics of the new multifamily development? And how do you think about your cost of capital? And then along the same lines, what is the thought process on the new commercial paper program and what upsize options do you have? Douglas Linde : Well, let's let Mike answer the commercial paper question, and then I want to answer the question on our return expectations for multifam. Michael LaBelle : So we decided to enter in this commercial paper program because we're always looking for additional markets to access especially in this environment. And it's the cheapest form of floating rate paper that we can issue.  Historically, we've been primarily fixed rate. We're going to continue to be primarily fixed rate, but I think we will have a moderate amount of floating rate debt on a consistent basis over the foreseeable future. Right now, we have about $1.2 billion of unsecured floating rate debt, and we have about $700 million of joint venture unsecured debt. I think it will go down from there going forward. But we view using this commercial paper program as a consistent piece of our debt structure over the next several years. And because we can save 75 basis points by using it, it's a very liquid marketplace, we've got high credit ratings. So our access has been good, and now we've experienced it for the first couple of weeks, which has been very, very positive. So we're building an investor base in it. So we just felt like additional arrow in our quiver from a capital perspective and lower cost of capital, both drove that decision. Owen Thomas : Yes. It's Owen, let me address the 121 Broadway development. As I described in my remarks, this is a notable building. It's the tallest building in Cambridge and it's also a very high-quality residential tower given the finishes and our design and planning.  Due to coordination with the development of the vault for Eversource. The project is not expected to deliver its first units until late 2027 and expected to stabilize and not until the second quarter of 2029. So again, you have to think about this project as part of the overall East Cambridge development that we've been working on and talking to all of you about for the last 2 or 3 years.  So the forecast returns on the 121 Broadway development alone are below our typical thresholds for development. However, if you look at the yields that we're receiving from the entire entitlement package. So that includes 121 Broadway. It includes 290 Binney Street, and it includes what we think we can get with the remaining commercial entitlements that we still have those projected returns do meet our development hurdles. And then to the extent that we are looking at new stick build, our expectation that those returns are going to be meaningfully higher than in urban development. And so we're talking about yields and well in excess of 6%. And that's what we need to consider starting a new residential development in 2024, 2025. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley. Ronald Kamdem : Just a quick 2-parter. So the first is on the occupancy expectations for a pickup in the back half of the year. You talked about sort of the strength in Back Bay and Park Avenue, but those markets are -- have relatively higher occupancy versus the rest of the portfolio. So I guess I'm trying to understand where is the biggest sort of occupancy gains, expectations in the back half? Is it the stronger markets? Or is it other parts of the portfolio like suburban? That's part one.  Part 2 is just a quick. Any sort of update on life sciences demand? Obviously, we're seeing a better fundraising environment, curious what you guys are seeing on the ground? Douglas Linde : So the answer to your first question is it's pretty what I would refer to as granular. It includes occupancy pickups in buildings like the General Motors building, where we are in active conversations with tenants right now to take some space pretty quickly in 2024. It's in Princeton, where as Hilary described, we have a pipeline of activity, and we believe some of those transactions will happen in 2024. It's in the greater Metropolitan Washington, D.C. market, primarily in Western Virginia, where we have a significant pipeline of active smaller deals that are going to occur in 2024.  It's the activity that I described in Waltham, almost all of that activity is expiring or vacant space, and the majority of that will land in 2024. And so it's kind of everywhere, and there's no really what I would offer you is big ticket that's going to dramatically change things one way or the other. And so we're -- again, that's why we're saying we think we're going to get back to where we were, which is effectively the 88% plus or minus percent occupancy by the end of 2024. And look, I hope that we see some positive surprises in addition to that where tenants move into space earlier. The lease -- we believe the leases will get signed. The question, and you've heard me say this before, is we just don't necessarily have a good handle on what the timing is going to be for when we can start recognizing revenue relative to whether the space has been demolished or we're doing a turnkey buildup where we're in control of it, and getting decisions made by our clients in terms of what they want in the space and having all that work to the point where they're actually physically able to occupy the space in 2024, which would mean that it would be able to be in part of our occupancy role numbers. On life science, I think life science demand is relatively slow. I'll let Bryan describe the life science demand in the greater Boston market, and I'll let Rod take a poke at talking about what's going on in South San Francisco. Bryan Koop : So in the Waltham market, which is the only spot we have vacancy, we don't have any in Cambridge. I'd say it's the same as it was in the previous quarter, but maybe a little bit more encouraging. Where we are encouraged is, as you noted, was yes, there is more funding coming back into the life science sector. But also when we talk to clients, we are encouraged by the fact that they are, call it, producing the things that they said they were going to do to their investors, and there is encouragement in terms of the possibility of products down the pipeline. So that's where we're getting most of our encouragement is that the clients we have are very excited about what they have going on. Rodney Diehl : Yes. Just in South San Francisco, our one project is the 651 Gateway building, and that is the -- it's basically a converted office building 16 stories. And that building is completed, and we've done 3 deals in there, 3, 4 floor deals, and those tenants are in various stages of moving in.  But in terms of new activity, it's been very slow. The few deals that are in the market tend to be smaller, call them, 10,000 to 20,000 feet, not the 200,000 foot deals that were in the market several years back. So that section has been quiet. But our building is actually very well positioned to attract that demand that is in the market. We have a space that is going to be built on a spec basis. We're going to do a full floor, which is going to be ready to accept that tenant when they're out there. So -- but the larger tenants are not there. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Richard Anderson from Wedbush Securities. Richard Anderson : First to comment, I'd say if you were most any other REIT, you would have normalized out your $0.06 or a lot of it and be up today, not down 3%. So I commend you for a commitment to FFO, as defined by NAREIT, I think it'll be rewarded for that over time. On to my question on -- just taking a peek at the Castle data and still utilization in the office space is sub-60%. I don't know how that compares to your premier asset type, but utilization is still not near where it was pre-pandemic. Is there a scenario where the BXP story can still work long term if we're looking at sort of a permanent condition of underutilization of office? Or do you feel like you need to get fully back to have a long-term story to tell. I'm just curious what you think about sort of the very long term when it comes to office utilization. Owen Thomas : Yes. Let me -- that was a lot to unpack there, but let me take a stab at it. So first of all, Castle data is highly used in the media and I think in the financial community. And I think it's a very imperfect measure of office demand. It's a decent measure of perhaps footfall in an urban area over a period of time.  So what do I mean by that? Many of the owners of premier workplaces don't use castle systems in their buildings. So we're not really exactly sure which buildings are being measured. It doesn't take into effect that the office market is less occupied today from a leasing standpoint, and it also looks at data over the course of the whole week, which is less relevant for office occupancy, what you really need to focus on its peak days. So I know everybody uses it, but it's not really a reflection of our experience, which is the following. We have turnstyle data for roughly half of our 55 million square feet under management. And we have carefully picked out same-store data for buildings that are essentially the same level -- has the same level of leasing as they did in March of 2020 as they do today.  And when you look at that data in New York, our buildings are basically at the same level of turn style swipes, Tuesday or Thursday, as they were in March of 2009. So New York is basically back. The other thing that's interesting is Friday was already slow before the pandemic and Monday is coming up. So there's -- I actually say New York is basically back to the way it was. Certainly, 3 days a week.  Boston is at about 75% on that measure. And the only place where it's really lagging is in San Francisco, which is about 45% or 50% for those peak days. And peak days are important because if you're a user of space, you need to have space for your people when they're all coming in. So it's not across the whole week. It's what is it on the peak days.  So again, we see improvement. As I tried to say over and over in my remarks, we think the issue -- the reason our leasing is slower today is actually not because of work from home. It's because of the earnings growth of the clients that we serve. We're a provider of services to businesses, not consumers. Those businesses are not growing their earnings, and if they're not growing their earnings, they're not hiring people and they're not taking space.  I think as earnings start to grow again, which frankly, we're seeing right now in the first quarter, our leasing will pick up. And I think Doug did a very good job of articulating some of those green shoots that we're already seeing that we should experience later this year. Douglas Linde : And Rich, just from a sort of macro thesis perspective, I think what is a 100% clear is that new construction is not part of the vernacular in 2024, 2025, which means unlikely you're going to see buildings delivered that aren't already under construction and there is such stuff under construction, but you're not going to be seeing new buildings delivered in any of these metropolitan areas for the next 5-plus years, right? That's how long it takes to build the building.  Look at the time frames associated with these press releases about a potential new building in Midtown Manhattan. And so if our thesis is -- continues to be accurate and Owen has described the difference between the premier and sort of the other portions of the office inventory, there is going to become less and less premier space and the premier space will continue to pick up its occupancy, it's the lease percentages and we will see the fruits of that in the properties that we have in all of our marketplaces.  And again, I harp back to sort of this dislocation that's occurring. What we are seeing in Washington, D.C. relative to the number of buildings that people would deem to be \"a to a minus\" buildings that are incapable at this point of making a leasing transaction because there is no capital available because the buildings are underwater to find out there's too much debt and the equity holders are saying, we're not prepared to put capital in for the benefit of the lender. It's changing the characteristics because of how these things occurring. And Jake, maybe you can spend a minute talking about sort of the dynamic of where tenants can look if they want to go into a building in a market, by the way, which has a very significant availability problems [indiscernible] Jake Stroman : Yes. I would just maybe second what Doug just noted that we are seeing really great activity across all of the buildings in our D.C. and Northern Virginia portfolio. The weight of the troubled assets and the dislocation in our region is really kind of playing to our favor.  Most of our buildings are preeminent workplaces and there's definitively a flight to quality, but there's also a real flight to certainty across the brokerage community who wants to do deals with somebody who tend new deals. So we're seeing that playing out in our favor in our region for sure. Operator : And so our next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Caitlin Burrows : Maybe just occupancy at 535 Mission, which is a newer build fleet has fallen below 60%, I think, related to WeWork. So Doug, I know you talked about how South of Market is lagging a bit, but can you talk about the demand at that vacancy? And then bigger picture how does that inform your view of the health of demand at the highest end of the market in SOMA ahead of first generation leases rolling over at that building and sales force in the coming year? Douglas Linde : Sure, Cait. I'll make a brief comment and let Rod describe it. So WeWork actually is in negotiation to remain in all the space that we have with them at that building. And we have an expiration with Zillow. It's truly a flash Zillow, their fact consolidation which occurred earlier and that's where the majority of the availability is. And Rod, you can describe sort of leasing prospects there and how things are looking in our portfolio in South market? Rodney Diehl : Yes. So that's right. The space that you're referring to is in the low rise of that building and it's the former Zillow/Trulia space. We've had some activity on it. We've had better activity on a couple of floors up top. In fact, we just completed the full floor of spec suites up on the 11th floor, which is getting excellent response from the market. So we expect to get that leased up quickly.  The balance of the SOMA portfolio, I mean we -- earlier on the call, the 680 Folsom availability was mentioned. That's the 200,000 square feet. We just got that space back technically today is the first day we have it as a vacant space. However, we've been marketing it for some time, and we had activity on that. We've been trading paper with various groups. There's another tenant that we're chasing right now.  So we're getting good looks for getting our shots at seeing these deals. I would say that we've had more activity on Northern market. So I'd say our Embarcadero Center property, frankly, is getting a little bit more attention in some of the Southern market stuff is. Just I think that's just the nature of where the demand is coming from more the traditional companies tended to be attracted to Embarcadero Center, where tech is still focused more South market. There is some space that is on the sublease market at Salesforce Tower that Salesforce has and they've been marketing it and it's getting good looks as well. So I mean, there are groups out there. So I'm very confident that we're going to use the space lease up. Operator : And so our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Mizuho. Vikram Malhotra : Just 2 quick ones. One, just -- I guess, Mike, I just want to clarify in the -- what you outlined for the guidance adjustment, do you mean just sort of where the curve has shifted overall? Or were you actually baking in some sort of rate cuts in your guidance? And then secondly, I guess, just in terms of achieving that occupancy uptick in the second half, is sort of the 1Q leasing run rate you also anticipate that to move up just given where expirations are? Michael LaBelle : So on the interest rate expectations, we have included an additional a rate cut in our expectations late in the year. And I think if that rate cut does not occur, it won't have a meaningful impact on what our guidance range is because of when it is within the year.  So we'll just have to see what happens with the inflation numbers in the Fed as we kind of think about where rates might be going both later this year and next year. But I don't think if there's no cuts this year, it's going to have a significant impact to our guidance. The other question was on leasing? I didn't -- can you restate the question? So the occupancy for Q1 was down a little bit in for Q2 it's going to be down a little bit again because of the 2 expirations that Doug talked about, which is the expiration of 680 Folsom in Times Square Tower. And then we don't have significant expirations of individual size in the back half of the year. And that's when many of the signed leases that we already have done, which Doug talked about, which is, I guess, 815,000 square feet for the company, of which over 650,000 square feet is in 2024, plus the LOIs that we have will start to take hold.  And so that gives us confidence that the occupancy will stabilize after the second quarter and hopefully start to move northward after that. That's our expectation. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya from Deutsche Bank. Omotayo Okusanya : Yes. I just wanted to go back to the guidance for the year. So if we take first quarter, we take the midpoint of the second quarter, you're about at 344 midpoint of guidance, the 704. We're talking about rates higher for longer, occupancy probably picking up in fourth quarter or so of the year. So could you just help us walk us through the acceleration of earnings in the back half? What the drivers of that will be? Michael LaBelle : So Omotayo, there's really 3, I think, impacts that are going to help us in the third and fourth quarter. The first is we expect NOI from the portfolio to be up, and we expect that to occur because the occupancy improvement that we have talked about. So I would expect that both third and fourth quarter will show higher portfolio NOI than what we have in the first and second quarter.  The other is G&A. So G&A is seasonally high in the first and second quarter because of just the timing of the vesting schedules as well as taxes that are paid on payroll. So that's a pretty meaningful move between quarters, it could be between $0.05 and $0.07 lower in the third quarter and the fourth quarter from where it is today.  And then the last piece is we do expect to have interest income be lower than it is today as we fund our development pipeline. And that is offset a little bit by capitalized interest. But I see our interest expense as being slightly lower next quarter and then stable and our interest income will drop a little bit sequentially by quarter as we spend on our development pipeline. So those are really the 3 things that are driving the improvement in our FFO in the third and fourth quarter to achieve the midpoint of the guidance range. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Griffin from Citi. Michael Griffin : Just maybe on the debt side, Owen, I'd be curious to get your thoughts. I mean, are banks willing to lend on new office development projects yet. And if so, what kind of interest rate you think today would lend at? And what kind of yield would you need to have to justify undertaking the development? Michael LaBelle : So this is Mike. I'll respond to this and the rest of the team can add on. Lenders in general are not getting payoffs. So typically, they have volume requirements that are pretty significant because they're constantly getting paid off and they need to replace and hopefully grow that.  In this environment, their borrowers are not necessarily paying them off. So they're not excited about increasing their exposure to commercial real estate and office properties right now. So I think as a whole, banks are not excited to provide lending, I think they would be more likely to lend on a stabilized piece of property at an appropriate debt yield than do a construction loan.  I think there's very little in the way of construction financing available out there, particular anything speculative. But if you came to a banking, you had a fully leased property maybe you could get that done. But again, the pricing is going to be, I don't know, 300 to 400 over SOFR. So SOFR is at 5.3%. So you're talking about 8% to 9% money. So it's really, really hard to make sense of that when that is the case.  So again, Doug talked about very little in the way of new construction going on. And I think the bank financing market is another limiting factor to that picture. Owen Thomas : Yes. Just to add to that, on your question on development yields. So let's divide this between office, life science versus residential. So on office, life science, our targets when rates were very low, we're in the 6% to 7% range. And I'd say those have gone up at least 200 basis points.  And as Mike described, it's very difficult to get financing. And also, as I described in my remarks, the cost of development has gone up and part of those costs are the inflation that Doug described, but also a part of it is the yield requirements given higher rates. So that's contributing.  And then on the residential, the way we've always thought about it was 100 basis points over exit cap with no -- with untrended rents. And so today, little hard to gauge, but there is some evidence of high-quality residential trading, say, in the mid-5s. So I think in terms of development yields, you're probably at least in the mid-6s on residential. And I -- and for us, to engage in that. We need a joint venture partner as we have at Skymark, which is our development that's going on right now in Reston. Michael LaBelle : The other -- just one other trend in bank financing, it's important to note is there's an upturning going on and there's an analysis of profitability going on by these banks of their relationships. So if you have a broad relationship where you're providing other kind of fee services and other things with these banks, and they can see a profitable relationship today and growing going forward, they're going to be willing to provide capital where they're not seeing that, they are exiting relationships. So that -- again, that benefits us because we have a very broad set of relationships that we have, and we do these bond deals where these things get fee income and things like this. And so we -- the relationship profitability we have is acceptable. So we are -- we continue to have banks wanting to add to our stable on our financing. And you've seen that. I mean, last year, we added 3 or 4 new banks to our facility. We continue to have banks that are interested in looking at what we're doing and are calling on us. Bryan Koop : Mike, the additional information market that we've wondered also is that as that just goes down their criteria for making a loan, of course, goes up. And the underwriting of the actual development firms that have a particular property has been incredibly closer and also the criteria for pre-leasing plus credit and the capital stack of equity. And it's just not there right now. And they're passing on everything that is in any way weak on the development front. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Dylan Burzinski from Green Street. Dylan Burzinski : Just wanted to go back to tech leasing and some of the comments that you made in your prepared remarks on about a lot of these companies overcommitting to space during the pandemic and then being currently in a digestion process. I guess if we sort of weigh that with how much earnings have grown for a lot of these companies over the last several years versus the head count that has grown despite some of the layoffs that have gone on.  I mean, how long do you expect this digestion process to last? Is this sort of a '25 event, in 2026 event? I'm just curious how you guys are sort of thinking about that and maybe in your discussions with a lot of these tenants, what they're telling you guys? Owen Thomas : Short answer. I mean, you're touching on a very key issue as it relates to the health of the [indiscernible] the answer is we don't really know. But I agree with what you said, our instinct is, yes, there was some over commitment. There's some digestion. There's some shedding going on, several tech companies have taken charges sub lease space out in the market. That seems to have slowed down recently. But our instincts and what we've seen in past cycles is at some point, those companies are healthy. They're in the center of all the innovation that's going on in the nation. They're going to -- they have a bright future. They're going to grow their earnings, and I think they will be back in the space market, but trying to figure out the exact timing of that is very challenging. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler. Alexander Goldfarb : Owen or Doug or whoever wants to take it. So I'm going to ask a 2-parter, but it's all related to the same. As you guys think about investment -- future investment to grow the company, a multipart, whether your landholdings in Northern Virginia still have any potential for data centers. If there's any office to resi conversion because of the new laws that may present opportunities to you whether it's existing assets or to invest in an asset that would be convertible? And three, what do you think it takes for Lexington AV next to Grand Central to finally benefit from what's going on West of Grand Central to come east of Grand Central? Owen Thomas : Well, there's a lot there. You violated Helen's rule of one question. That's okay, Alex. We'll still answer them all. So anyway, I'll just start. Lexington Avenue is doing well. I mean where we are at 53rd Street, it's right where the subway station is and 601 and is fully leased or very close to it and 599 is well on its way. So and 399 -- I mean on Park Avenue, but it's back end is on the lag, right, at the same location and those buildings are performing extremely well.  I think that location on Lexington Avenue is also unique because of the access to the subway. So on residential, so I don't think there's any -- I don't want to say any assets, but I don't think there's going to be a significant opportunity in our portfolio of existing assets to convert them to residential. I mean frankly, the only ones that are empty or ones that we've emptied out for life science conversion and some -- they all have some level of leasing. I'm not sure they have the physical characteristics for it. That all being said, we do have land parcels that you see in our supplemental and in several cases, we are working with local communities to rezone that land from commercial to residential. And given some of the regulatory overlay that's going on in many of our communities and states that process is a little less challenging than it used to be. So I think that's where we will benefit. And then I do think there may be opportunities, and we're certainly looking at them for our residential team to get involved in office building conversions of buildings that we don't currently own. We've always felt that this is going to be an important in commercial real estate, it's certainly one that's going to unfold slowly, but you're seeing it unfold right now, and there's an increasing number of projects in many of our markets. Douglas Linde : Yes. And just to put a little bit of meat on the sort of carcass of that on the residential conversion side for us. So it's 17 Hartwell Avenue. In Lexington, we have a 30,000 square foot office building that we will demolish and that we are getting entitlements to build 350 plus or minus residential units. In Shady Grove, which is a piece of land that we bought hopefully, to have thought about doing some life science. We said we're going to pivot, and we're going to do, hopefully, some life science at some point, but we're going to be residential. And so we're selling a piece of parcel to a townhome developer, and we're also working on the residential portion of that development. And then third, we bought some older relatively inexpensive office buildings with an existing parking structure in Herndon, Virginia, and we just received approval to convert that site to multifamily, both townhome and multifamily apartments, and we are likely to sell the townhomes and potentially either sell or develop the residential. So we are actively doing that.  And then jumping to the other side of the country, our assets at North First, which we've owned for quite some time, which we had hoped to build up some kind of office on. We are now working with the city of San Jose on converting a portion of that site to a residential entitlement, and we would build some residential and potentially provide a parcel for affordable housing to somebody else who would build that.  And then obviously, down in Santa Monica, there's a real question about what Santa Monica Business Park will become over the next, call it, decade or 2. But I -- it would not be unlikely to see not just office development there, but to also see other uses, including some kind of residential on that site. So this is sort of something that we are working actively on as we speak. It's not about converting an office building in Times Square to residential or an office building in the CBD of Washington, D.C. to residential, or an office building in Back Bay or in the Financial District in Boston to residential. Our buildings do not line up with the kinds of assets that likely would be potentially convertible if the economics actually worked, which they don't right now over the next, call it, 4 or 5 years. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Upal Rana from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Upal Rana : Just real quick, Doug, thanks for your color on the existing pipeline. And the update on the Carnegie Center. I wanted to see if you can give us an update on the ongoing backfill at 680 Folsom and 7 Times Square? Douglas Linde : Why don't I let -- I mean, I think, Rod, you mentioned 680 Folsom before, but you can reiterate that. And then Hilary, you can talk about 7 Times Square. Rodney Diehl : Yes. Just real quick on 680. Yes, we have 200,000 feet on the low-rise portion of that building and it's excellent space. It's some of the best space in the market. It's a nice floor plate size, it's 34,000 feet and it's got high ceilings and it's excellent space. So we've been marketing it, and we've had proposals that we've been pursuing. And -- so we're going to continue to do that on that space, but it's very high-quality space in our portfolio. Hilary Spann : On 7 Times Square, I think the team here in New York has done a fantastic job of converting some of the space that was sublet by the major law firm tenant in that building to direct tenancies, and in the first quarter, we signed a direct lease at 7 Times Square for 27,000 square feet. So we're continuing to chip away at the pending vacancy. I will say that the Times Square submarket unique more or less among markets in Midtown is exhibiting reasonable sort of weakness. In terms of demand, and that just has to do a little bit with the streetscape and some of the other things that are going on there, which we are working very hard with the city and other folks in the neighborhood to address. But I think we are encouraged by our ability to convert sublease tenants to direct tenants. We are pursuing every tenant that's in that submarket that makes sense for the building. And we're just going to continue to chip away at it. But at the moment, I wouldn't describe it as a submarket that's got lots of large tenant demand sort of breaking down the door. It's just chipping away at it lease by lease. Operator : And I show our last question in the queue comes from Camille Bonnel from Bank of America. Jing Xian Tan : [indiscernible] are looking for ways to manage the revenue streams and recently, the Mayor of Boston has been talking about raising commercial property taxes. I understand you can pass a lot of these costs through to tenants. So not much of an impact to your operating margins. But do you get a sense that these potential tax increases could change a tenant's view on whether they take a lease in the market versus going somewhere else? And does this make investing in Boston less attractive, adding upward pressure to cap rates? Douglas Linde : So let me take a stab at that, and I'll let Bryan provide his perspective as well. We don't think passing expenses on to tenants is a good way to treat our clients. And we do everything we possibly can to reduce our operating expense escalations every single year, and we spend hours and hours finding ways to change the things that we're doing, so that we do not have to have dramatic increases. The commercial property sector currently bears a disproportionate portion of the benefit or the burden of taxes in the city of Boston. As assessments change and residential assessments go up and commercial assessments go down, obviously, we all know understand what's going on with regards to overall environmental issues associated with interest rates, valuations, occupancy, capital cost, it's very hard for us to think it would be a good thing for the commercial office property sector to bear a higher proportion of those expenses than they currently are bearing. And so we're -- we don't think that these types of policies are good for our business or good for the companies that occupy our buildings. We're hopeful that these types of ideas will not do the day and that there will be pushback from the constituents in the various communities that we'll sort of see that it probably isn't the right time to be asking the commercial sector to have a larger proportion of the burden on any kind of regulation given the challenges associated with our business. Bryan? Bryan Koop : Really no further clarification, Doug, other than we have made it quite clear to political leadership our position. Operator : This concludes our Q&A session. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to Owen Thomas for closing remarks. Owen Thomas : Yes, no further comments. Thank you all for your attention and interest in BXP. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

After the speakers presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference call over to your first speaker, Helen Han, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Helen Han : Good morning, and welcome to BXP's second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. The press release and supplemental package were distributed last night, we furnished on Form 8-K. In the supplemental package, BXP has reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G.

During the Q&A portion of our call, Ray Ritchie, Senior Executive Vice President, and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions. We ask that those of you participating in the Q&A portion of the call to please limit yourself to only one question. If you have an additional clarity or follow-up, please feel free to rejoin the queue. I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks. Owen Thomas : Thank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. BXP's performance in the second quarter once again demonstrated the relative market strength of the premier workplace segment of the commercial office industry as well as BXP's strength and execution. Our FFO per share was $0.06 above our forecast and $0.05 above market consensus for the second quarter. Further, we raised the midpoint of our FFO per share guidance for 2024 by $0.08. We completed over 1.3 million square feet of leasing, which is 41% greater than the second quarter of 2023 and close to our 10-year average leasing volume for the second quarter. As our leasing volume continues to escalate exceeding current lease expirations, we expect our occupancy will increase over time. Weighted average lease term on leases signed this past quarter remained long at nine years. On sustainability this past quarter, we released our 2023 Sustainability & Impact Report, hosted our third annual Sustainability & Impact Investor Update and were recognized by Time Magazine as one of the world's most sustainable companies, ranking number one in the U.S. among property owners. Delivering sustainable real estate solutions is increasingly important to our clients as well as the communities where we operate, and decreases our cost of capital given the growing number of ESG investors interested in our debt and equity securities. Moving to macro market conditions. We continue to experience market tailwinds for the two most important external forces impacting BXP's performance, interest rates and corporate earnings growth. The U.S. inflation report released on July 11th reflected a 3% inflation rate for June, lower than expectations, sparking new forecasts of accelerated interest rate cuts by the Fed as well as lower market yields for the 10-year U.S. Treasury. Lower interest rates are obviously favorable for real estate and BXP's valuation and for broader corporate earnings growth, the second important external factor driving BXP's performance. After remaining flat for all of 2023, S&P 500 earnings growth was 6.6% in the first quarter of this year and is expected to be around 9% for the second quarter. As mentioned repeatedly, companies with earnings growth are much more likely to invest, to hire and to lease additional space as demonstrated in our growing leasing volumes this year. Premier workplaces, defined as the highest quality 6.5% of buildings, representing 13.1% of total space in our five CBD markets continue to materially outperform the broader market. Direct vacancy for premier workplaces is 13% versus 18.5% for the broader market. Likewise, net absorption for premier workplaces has been a positive 6.9 million square feet over the last three years versus a negative 22.8 million square feet for the broader market. Asking rents for premier workplaces are 51% higher than the broader market, a consistent gap from prior quarters. This outperformance is evident in BXP's portfolio where just under 90% of our NOI comes from assets located in CBDs that are predominantly premier workplaces. These CBD assets are 90.4% occupied and 92.2% leased as of the end of the second quarter. We are also experiencing moderate, but steady increases in workers returning to the office based on the turnstile data we capture for roughly half of our 54 million square foot portfolio. Corporations continue to push for increased office attendance, including Salesforce, who recently announced their new policy shift from primarily flexible work to mandatory office attendance for most employees of three to five days per week depending on job function. Regarding the real estate private equity capital markets, office sales volume in the second quarter continued to be muted at $6.9 billion and has ranged from $6.2 billion to $9.1 billion for the last six quarters, well below volumes achieved before the Fed started raising interest rates in 2022. Completed transaction activity for premier workplaces has been very limited, though increasingly, owners are testing the market to understand pricing. Moving to BXP's capital allocation activities. We remain active in pursuing acquisitions from owners and lenders, but as mentioned have seen limited opportunities in the premier workplace segment. We are in active negotiations for the disposition of four land positions, which, if successful, would generate approximately $150 million of proceeds, half of which could be realized this year. For our development pipeline, we delivered into service the 118,000 square foot Dick's House of Sport on Boylston Street at the Prudential Center in Boston, fully leased at a strong yield. On July 12, we opened Skymark, our 508-unit luxury residential tower development at Reston Town Center. We've already leased 21% of the units ahead of schedule and rents are also modestly above projections. We continue to push forward with several residential projects primarily on land we control that are being entitled and designed for which we intend to raise JV equity capital. DXP continues to execute a significant development pipeline with 10 office lab retail and residential projects underway as of the end of the second quarter. These projects aggregate approximately 3.1 million square feet and $2.3 billion of BXP investment with $1.2 billion remaining to be funded and will contribute to BXP's external FFO per share growth over time. The market segment for the broad office asset class remains challenging. BXP continues to leverage its key strengths, which are : our commitment to premier workplaces and our clients as many competitors disinvest in the office sector; a strong balance sheet with ready access to capital and the secured and unsecured debt in private equity markets; and one of the highest quality portfolios of premier workplaces in the U.S. assembled over several decades of intentional development acquisitions and dispositions. So in conclusion, BXP continues to display resilience with a growing leasing pipeline as well as stability in FFO per share and dividend level, and is well positioned to continue to gain market share in both assets and clients during this time of market dislocation for the office sector. Expectations for lower interest rates and stronger corporate earnings growth will also provide tailwinds for our renewed growth over time. So now, Doug, I'd like to wish you a happy birthday. And I'll turn the call over, and you can talk about our strong leasing activity. Douglas Linde : Thanks, Owen, I really enjoy celebrating my birthday with all of you on the call every two years, one of the highlights. So as we described during our NAREIT June meetings and the webcast that we did, the trend line of BXP's leasing activity in the second quarter of '24 picked up materially relative to what we executed in the first quarter and what we discussed on our last call, all really good stuff. As of June 30, we've completed 2.2 million square feet of leasing for '24. When we spoke to you during our May call, we stated our pipeline of leases under negotiation at that time, May 1, was 875,000 square feet. And as Owen highlighted, we signed leases for 1.32 million square feet between April 1 and June 30, a lot more. And our active pipeline of leases under documentation today has grown to 1.39 million square feet. So if we complete this pool of transactions, we will have leased 3.59 million square feet of space, exclusive of our leases and documentation. We have an additional set of transactions under discussion totaling about 850,000 square feet. So if we execute 50% of those transactions, we will more than achieve our leasing guidance of 4 million square feet for the year. This quarter, we completed 73 transactions, 37 lease renewals for 830,000 square feet, 36 new leases encompassing 500,000 square feet. 12 clients expanded into 228,000 square feet of additional square footage, while we had 4 contractions totaling 63,000 square feet. 45% of our absorption was growth from our existing client pool. As a point of comparison, last quarter, we completed 61 transactions with 29 renewals, encompassing about 400,000 square feet and 32 leases for 494,000 square feet, and we had only 3 expansions for 18,000 square feet, and we had 4 contractions totaling 44,000 square feet. So again, really big improvements. Q2 activity was concentrated in our East Coast markets with 445,000 square feet in New York, 343,000 square feet in Boston and 351,000 square feet in Northern Virginia. These 3 markets made up 1.14 million square feet or 86% of the activity. Our West Coast activity was almost exclusively in San Francisco with 146,000 square feet. The majority of our client expansion came from Manhattan this quarter. The only significant contraction in the portfolio came from a tech company downsizing in Reston. We had 3 transactions over 100,000 square feet, one each in Boston, New York and Reston. Expansions or new clients made up 42% of the activity in New York, 40% in Boston, 37% on the West Coast and 16% in D.C. As reported in our supplemental, the mark-to-market of leases that commenced this quarter, which is about a 375,000 square foot base, was up 6% and transaction costs averaged $11 per square foot per year. The overall mark-to-market of the [ restarting ] cash rent on leases executed this quarter, which was a 1.15 million square feet pool relative to the previous in-place cash rent was about flat. The starting rents on leases we signed during the second quarter were up about 8% in Boston, really flat in New York, down 6% in D.C. and down 7% on the West Coast. Now I want to spend a minute on our occupancy change during the quarter, which seemed to have been a focus of many of the analyst reports that we saw this morning and last night. As we stated in February and May, we have 2 large known expirations, one in April, 200,000 square feet at 680 Folsom, which is in the second quarter figures and one in July, 200,000 square feet at Times Square Tower. That's a JV asset, so our percentage share is 110, but we report the 200. This quarter, we also vacated 148,000 square feet of occupied but non-revenue-producing spaces. What do I mean? Well, we had some tenants in default where we had stopped recognizing revenue yet they were still in possession and we were in legal proceedings to vacate the space. In addition, we took back 60,000 square feet from WeWork at Dock 72, but there, the absolute rent that we were receiving remains the same. It's just on a lower square footage. Finally, we terminated a 33,000 square foot lease in Waltham that was simultaneously released but won't be delivered into next quarter. Those movements account for 92% of the reduction in our occupancy in the second quarter from the first quarter. As of June 30, we have approximately one million square feet of signed leases that have not commenced. Hence, the 200 basis points difference between occupied space and leased space. In the first quarter, our leasing included 383,000 square feet of vacant space leasing. This quarter, that same vacant space leasing was 362,000 square feet. These leases are all part of our leased square footage percentage. Our pipeline of leases in negotiation includes an additional 635,000 square feet of currently vacant space, which if signed will contribute another 130 basis points to our leased square footage. In addition to the known 200,000 square feet expiration at Times Square Tower in Q3, our 2 Waltham life science developments will be added into our in-service portfolio in the third and fourth quarters, 180 CityPoint and 103 Fourth Avenue, respectively. There are combined 32% occupied, which will reduce our in-service occupancy. These additions will result in about a 50 basis point reduction at the year-end. For those of you that are focused on the next quarter, we expect us to be lower by about 40 basis points with a recovery in the fourth quarter where most of the leases that have been signed start to commence where we project occupied space to be between 87% and 87.5%, inclusive of the addition to the in-service portfolio. In previous quarters, we have not been including the additions to in-service portfolio, but we're doing that now because it's a quarter away. Our leased space will continue to be above 89%. BXP continues to lease space. In Manhattan, almost all of our demand continues to originate from financial institutions, alternative asset managers, professional service organizations and law firms. In many circumstances, these clients are expanding. Concessions are flat and taking market rents have risen double digits in 2024. The sub 8% availability in the Park Avenue submarket is a direct reflection of these users growing and competing for limited blocks of space. In one of our assets, we have 3 tenants that would like more space, and we have no immediate availability. We had more than 130,000 square feet of expansions at the General Motors Building and at 601 Lexington Avenue this quarter. Our strongest tour activity in New York City continues to be in the submarket. At the same time, technology demand across the city continues to be light. We completed a single floor lease at 360 Park Avenue South with a digital media firm this quarter, but Midtown South is a tech branded submarket in the city, where transactions over 20,000 square feet have been very limited in 2024. In Princeton, we completed 10 transactions totaling 150,000 square feet during the quarter, including an extension and expansion with a foreign pharma company. In the Back Bay and the Financial District of Boston, we completed 195,000 square feet of leasing this quarter. The majority of this activity was in our Back Bay portfolio and the clients were alternative asset managers and professional services firms. The Back Bay continues to outperform the financial district, which continues to have to digest the new construction pipeline. Our remaining activity was in our Waltham urban edge portfolio, where we completed just over 110,000 square feet and 90% of those transactions were on either existing or near-term vacancy, not renewals. Here, the demand came from a consumer products company, a homebuilder and a few pharma life science companies with office requirements. We've execute one 25,000 square foot life science lab lease. The life science lab demand in Greater Boston continues to be lackluster, with tenants displaying a little urgency around any potential new requirements or relocations. To date, this year, there have been 8 nonrenewal lab deals in Waltham, Lexington, Watertown and West Cambridge that didn't involve a sublet. Only one was greater than 25,000 square feet. Our Reston portfolio was responsible, as I said, for virtually all of our executed leases this quarter in the D.C. region. Leasing activity and tenant demand growth is coming primarily from 2 industries, cybersecurity and defense contracting. We had just over 30,000 square feet of expansion from existing tenants but we also experienced, as I said, a 50,000 square foot contraction from a traditional tech company. The vibrant residential and retail environment continues to be a natural location for small businesses in the financial services and legal industry as well, and we did do 6 leases at 5,000 square feet or less in the Town Center as well as a handful of retail deals. The District of Columbia office market is becoming more and more bifurcated. The private sector tenant demand is dominated by the legal industry in D.C., but in almost every case law firm renewal or relocations are resulting in smaller requirements which is leading to negative absorption as we have all read and seen. It doesn't look like the government leasing or usage is going to help with this problem. However, with the either existing or near-term high vacancy, there are many buildings with overleveraged capital structures unwilling to provide capital for new transactions, and therefore, they have very little client interest. When clients do want space, they prefer to be on the top of refurbished, amenity-rich, well-capitalized buildings. There appears to be limited opportunities in the market that meet these clients' demand so our availability at 2200 Penn and 901 New York Avenue should fare well over the next few quarters. On a comparative basis, the West Coast markets, particularly San Francisco, are seeing more demand in '24 than '23. However, additional sublet availability and technology company lease downsizing upon lease expirations continue to mute the positive demand emanating from the AI organizations that continue to look for space. Tech growth away from AI has yet to emerge. The San Francisco CBD also continues to act as a financial center of the West Coast with its own set of asset managers, including private equity firms and venture firms, some hedge funds a few specialized fund managers and obviously, their financial and legal advisers. This is the source of the bulk of the transactional activity in the market. And while the brokers correctly report a pickup and tenants in the market. If you look more closely, very little of that demand represents net growth from those tenants. Our San Francisco activity continues to center on traditional non-tech demands at Embarcadero Center. This quarter, we completed an 80,000 square foot law firm renewal with no change in square footage and five smaller deals, all 12,000 square feet or less with new tenants on currently vacant space. We continue to see many of the professional services in law firm continuing to downsize, which is in stark contrast to the activities of those same tenants in New York and Boston. We are seeing a steady flow of potential tenants 12,000 square feet or less, which is about a full floor at our 535 Mission property. But this is in contrast to 680 Folsom whose location is less desirable for non-tech demand and where the potential tech clients continue to have inexpensive furnished sublet options. Tenant activity is improving in our Mountain View research R&D buildings, where we have about 215,000 square feet of availability and uniquely attractive products. These buildings are designed for companies that are making some sort of device, be it a car sensor, a photovoltaic panel or a medical device. They don't compete with the large multistory office product that has flooded the market. We saw activity come to a halt when the SVB imploded last year. The entrepreneurial device maker companies still exist, and they are now slowly making capital commitments once again and looking at leasing space. The lab market story in South San Francisco is not dissimilar to Greater Boston. There were only a handful of new leases completed during the first six months of the year that didn't involve a renewal or sublease though there have been about 100,000 square feet of new deals completed in the last 30 days. Overall, we are experiencing an improving operating environment. Leasing available space is primarily driven by gaining market share from competitive landlords and/or lower quality building, but not net new market demand growth. While the markets need consistent incremental absorption to show a macro recovery, we have started to see pockets of strength where low availability is driving constructive client behavior, the Back Bay of Boston and the Park Avenue submarket of New York are the obvious examples. As clients choose premier properties and sound financial condition operated by best property management team, we will continue to be successful in capturing demand, leasing space and increasing our occupancy. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike. Michael LaBelle : Great. Thanks, Doug. Happy birthday. Douglas Linde : Thank you. Michael LaBelle : So this morning, I'm going to cover the details of our second quarter performance and the increase to our 2024 full-year guidance. So for the second quarter, we reported funds from operations of $1.77 per share that exceeded the midpoint of our guidance from last quarter by $0.06 per share. Our portfolio NOI came in $0.01 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance. The majority of this resulted from lower operating expenses in the quarter. Our rental revenue was closely aligned with our expectations. And as Doug described, our occupancy decline was anticipated in our guidance as we've covered with you in the last two earnings calls. $0.05 of our earnings beat came from a reduction in non-cash interest expense that we don't expect to recur and that you should not incorporate in our run rate going forward. The change is due to our reassessing of future earnout payment related to our Skyline multifamily project in Oakland. The reassessment results in the reversal of $9 million of previously accrued non-cash interest expense. Our structuring of this deal with the protection of an earnout in lieu of an upfront land purchase is saving us nearly $40 million of projected land payments. So moving to the full-year. We're increasing our FFO guidance for 2024 to $7.09 to $7.15 per share. At the midpoint, this equates to $7.12 per share and is an increase of $0.08 per share over the prior guidance midpoint. In addition to the second quarter outperformance, we anticipate $0.02 per share of better projected portfolio NOI in the back half of the year from our in-service portfolio. We've negotiated three lease terminations, all in Boston, with payments that will add incremental income in the second half of 2024. Net of lost rental income or NOI is projected to be higher by approximately $4 million or $0.02 a share. The geography of the expected improvement shows up as an increase in termination income and a modest reduction of same-property NOI. We don't include termination income in our same property guidance, and we guide to it separately. So you will see in our detailed guidance table in our supplemental that our full year '24 termination income guidance is now $14 million to $16 million, up $8 million. Correspondingly, we've reduced our 2024 same-property NOI growth by 25 basis points at the midpoint to a range of negative 1.5% to negative 3% from 2023. If not for the terminations, our same-property performance expectations would have been in line with our prior guidance. To provide a little more detail, most of our termination income comes from terminations we have negotiated to allow us to sign new long-term leases with both expanding and new clients. These transactions are reducing our occupancy by 100,000 square feet temporarily but the impact will be short term as we have new leases coming in after 6 to 12 months of downtime that will cover virtually all of the space. These deals reduce our 2024 occupancy by about 20 basis points and are reflected in our updated occupancy guidance. We've also modified our guidance for net interest expense to incorporate the $0.05 per share of lower interest expense recorded in the second quarter. This results in lower interest expense for the full-year and a new guidance range for net interest expense of $578 million to $588 million. The remaining components of our prior guidance have not changed meaningfully, and overall, our earnings performance for 2024 is exceeding our prior expectations. I would like to spend a minute on interest rates as there's been no consistency quarter-to-quarter on Fed rate cut projections. Back in January, the Street was projecting 4 to 5 rate cuts starting in the second quarter, then the first quarter data came out and the Street changed that to 0 to 1 cut. And now with more progress on inflation, the Street has reverted back to 3 cuts this year. We have not changed our base model that assumes one 25 basis point cut in December. Should the Fed cut by 25 basis points 3x starting in September, our interest expense will be about $2 million or $0.01 per share lower, which is within our guidance range. Another item that could impact interest expense is the refinancing of our $850 million, 3.35% bond expiring in January 2025. We have access to multiple debt markets, and in general, the bond markets have been improving with tighter spreads and lower treasury rates. We are evaluating the timing of replacement financing, and it is possible we could hit the market this year. We would expect to invest any financing proceeds temporarily in bank deposits that currently earn approximately 5% and then redeem the bond at its expiration. We haven't included the impact of a potential debt transaction in our current guidance. So in conclusion, we're increasing our guidance for FFO to $7.09 to $7.15 per share. This is an $0.08 share increase from the midpoint from our prior guidance. The primary reason is the improvement of $0.05 per share of lower noncash interest expense, $0.05 of higher termination income offset by $0.02 of lower same-property NOI from the lost rental income related to lease terminations. That completes our formal remarks. Operator, can you open up the line for questions? Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions]. And I show our first question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Nick Yulico : Thanks. Good morning. So I appreciate some of the clarity there on the occupancy guidance and the leasing activity. Sounds like some of this is -- or a lot of this is sort of timing related in terms of the adjustment to the occupancy and same-store guidance. Is there a way to give us a feel for if some of the recent leasing pace continues, how that could translate into occupancy growth next year? I know Owen did talk earlier about getting to the point where occupancy will increase over time. I mean any sort of early thoughts on 2025 impact? Thanks. Douglas Linde : So Nick, this is Doug. So I think that Owen's comment was 100% accurate, which is our occupancy is going to increase. Mike would also tell you that we have a cycle with regards to particularly our CBD leasing, which by the way, we're in the mid-90s on an occupancy level right now. Where those leases take some time to go from lease to occupied, right? So we have a 200,000 square foot piece of space that's available in a particular building, and we sign a lease for it, but we may not see actual occupancy for 12 to 16 months because the tenant has to actually physically build out the space. And so it's a little hard for us to give you a tight projection on when our occupancy number will actually start to materially increase. The trajectory is -- there's no question it's going up. And if we end the year again with this new adjusted in-service portfolio with the availability that we have in these life science buildings, in the mid 87s, we will -- my guess is, be in the 88 in 2025, and we could get lucky relative to delivering some space where the tenant takes it in and as condition. And suddenly, we get a big pickup in \"occupied\", and therefore, we can start recognizing revenue. Those are the kind of things that would make a material difference, but we're not counting on those. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. You guys talked about maybe pursuing some new apartment developments. I'm just curious if you sort of look at pricing today for materials and kind of current rents, what sort of yields do you get on un-trended rents today? And it sounds like you might bring in JV partners, but how would you just sort of think about funding those? And what percentage of those deals would you likely keep? Owen Thomas : Yes. Steve, it's Owen. So most of what we're pursuing is on land or other assets that we control that we are re-entitling. There's -- it's no secret that there's a shortage of housing, certainly affordable housing in this country broadly. And I think communities are a lot more interested in entitling housing projects today than they have been in the past. And that's a real help to our activities. The obstacle is what you described, which is costs, which have gone up not only for materials but also capital, given interest rates. But to come to your question, we have a pretty significant portfolio of land that we control that we're pushing through this entitlement and design process, but not all the projects pencil. What we're trying to get on a project basis is mid-6 yields and higher. And as you also suggested, our goal would be to bring in JV partners for that. I mentioned this Skymark project that we are currently opening in Reston, we own 20% of that project and have an 80% JV partner. And our hope is to establish similar types of joint ventures for these projects in our pipeline. Douglas Linde : Yes. And Steve, this is Doug. I will just make the following additional comment, which is this stuff works with stick frame. So the things that we are looking at in our Suburban I'd say, non-office likely potential properties in the Greater Waltham market as well as in Northern Virginia are the places where you will probably see us being able to start things sooner rather than later. CBD construction and CBD rents are much harder to pencil right now. And all of our teams are looking at it and studying it, but we don't -- we're not sure that 2025 will be a position from -- an economic start on that stuff. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Griffin with Citi. Your line is open. Michael Griffin : Great, thanks. Owen, I want to go back to your comments around expectation for forward earnings growth and kind of how that translates to leasing. Should we take it as the fact that there is a pivot to earnings growth improves the outlook versus maybe the magnitude of what corporate earnings growth is expected to be maybe relative to history? And then I imagine that a lot of that growth is coming from tech companies, just given the fact that they've been more hesitant to lease space as we've seen over the past couple of years, how does that maybe factor into using that metric as a good forward indicator of leasing demand? Owen Thomas : Yes, Michael. Good morning. So we provide in our IR deck, a graph of S&P 500 earnings growth versus BXP's leasing activity. There's a clear correlation. Not all of our clients are in the S&P 500, but S&P 500 earnings growth is just an indicator of, I would say, corporate health. And when companies are growing and they're healthy, they're more likely to invest higher and lease space. So I think it's real. And this year, it's proving itself once again because in '23, we had more muted leasing activity. There was no S&P 500 earnings growth. This year, the growth is stronger and our leasing is stronger. So that correlation holds. You are 100% right. I think, in terms of your comments about tech leasing. When you look at the markets today, I would say outside of tech and life science, our leasing is almost back to normal, whatever that is defined as pre-pandemic. Those are the two places that there is a gap. And I recognize some of the S&P 500 earnings growth is coming from tech companies. But again, when you look at the data, that correlation holds, S&P 500 earnings growth to leasing, and it seems like it's holding this year in 2024. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. John Kim : Thank you. You pushed back the stabilization dates of several development projects. How should we think about the likely lease-up period versus those new dates, and Mike, if you can remind us of your capitalization interest policy. I know in the past, you stopped capitalizing as soon as initial occupancy took place. And I just wanted to clarify that position. Douglas Linde : So John, I think that the stabilization dates assume a 85% occupied square footage of the building. So that's sort of how that works. So presumably, the leasing would be done in the 12 to 18 months prior to that date occurring and we would be building out space and generating revenue when those tenants actually moved in. And I'll let Mike talk about our capitalization method. Michael LaBelle : So the policy around capitalization is that we stop capitalizing interest and any expenses associated with assets like real estate taxes, 12 months after the base building is completed. So like for 103 CityPoint and 180 CityPoint that Doug described that is going into the in-service portfolio later this year, those base buildings completed in the third and fourth quarter '23. So in the third and fourth quarter '24, the capitalized interest will stop on those assets. And so they're not fully leased. So we'll have some impact there. The 751 gateway asset completed its base building in the second quarter of '24 and 360 Park is later this year. So those will have some impact next year and then later next year for 360 Park. That's kind of the timing associated with how the capitalized interest works. Douglas Linde : And again, unfortunately, it's just geography, but we throw all of these development assets 12 months after we've completed base building into our in-service portfolio wherever they are leased. And so they have a muting effect on our occupancy, even though they're not really apples-to-apples part of the in-service portfolio that we're describing on a sort of quarter-by-quarter basis. Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing our next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Blaine Heck : Great, thanks. Good morning. Owen, conversations about the potential impacts of the election are ramping up. So I wanted to get your thoughts on whether you see any possible changes in regulations or the overall economic or political environment that would be impactful to your business under either party? Owen Thomas : Yes. I don't think it's a huge difference for us. I mean, clearly, there's some tax issues that are coming up over the next couple of years where if there's a -- one party or the other gets elected, it could have some impact. But I will say state and local elections have a larger impact on our day-to-day business. What's going on with real estate taxes in our city, what's our ability to entitle real estate, what's going on with commuter -- transit, what's going on with safety and crime and are -- in the streets of our cities. Those types of issues have a bigger impact on us than issues at the federal level. Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing our next question, comes from the line of Camille Bonnel from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Camille Bonnel : Good morning. I wanted to pick up on the portfolio's CapEx spend for the first half of the year, which looks to be tracking in line with 2023 levels and well below your historic average. So could you provide an update on the CapEx assumptions you have planned, given expectations for higher lease commencement? Michael LaBelle : So our maintenance CapEx, I would suggest it's going to run somewhere between $80 million and $100 million this year, which is in line with, I would say, historical type of averages, maybe a little bit lower. We do have some repositioning CapEx that is more meaningful this year than it was last year, primarily at 200 Clarendon Street, where we're putting in a pretty significant amenity center that is going to result in tenant retention and higher rents in that asset. So you may have noticed this quarter, there was a little bit more of repositioning capital. On the leasing side, this quarter was lower because we just didn't have that many leases commenced this quarter. It was just a little bit bulky, obviously, quarter-to-quarter on our leases commenced. And I think that a run rate -- annual run rate is $200 million to $240 million of lease transaction costs that would be part of our AFFO calculation. Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing our next question, comes from the line of Connor Mitchell with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Connor Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Kind of following along with Mike's answer there and providing some CapEx on adding some amenities. I was just wondering, with the leasing coming back, you guys had a good quarter of leasing volume and building out the pipeline some more, do you feel it's time to really reengage in building amenity upgrades in existing buildings? Or are you still looking for a little bit more of a push from the demand side? Douglas Linde : So this is Doug. What I would say is I'm going to ask some of the regional management teams to discuss what's going on, but we have effectively done almost every building from the sort of a reimagination, reamenitization project perspective, it's either underway or it's just about complete. And I can let Rod talk about what's going on Embarcardero Center and I'll let Peter, Jake talk about the things that we've been doing in the Greater D.C. market, and then Brian can discuss 200 Clarendon Street, but that's kind of the last of the major changes. Hilary has a few little things going on the margin in some of her buildings. But why don't we start with Rod. Rodney Diehl : Yes. So as Doug mentioned, we are in the process of doing an amenity center at Embarcadero Center. And this is -- we have always had a conference facility. And what we've done now is basically we're decommissioning that conference facility and we're building a brand-new both conference and amenity center over three Embarcadero. So that is under construction, and it's got both indoor and outdoor space. It's going to be available primarily to our tenants, but it will be available to the general public as well. And we're excited about it. And it's an absolute must. I mean we are making those same improvements, similar in concept anyway at our other projects, and it's demanded by the tenants. So very excited about getting this one done. Douglas Linde : Pete? Peter Otteni : Hey, good morning. This is Pete Otteni in D.C. So I would say we've been, as Doug said, through several major projects here in the D.C. market. We just opened Wisconsin Place in the Chevy Chase Maryland market here recently to great fanfare and we're optimistic that, that's going to translate as Rod was just describing, and Doug did into both increased demand and retention at the property. We're under construction at Sumner Square, and that will be done later this year. That's the result of some leasing that we have -- Jake and his team have mostly already done, and that was demanded by some of those tenants through part of their renewal. And then upcoming is at 901 New York Avenue as part of our lease renewal with Finnegan late last year and early this year. we're doing a pretty major renovation of both that lobby, the existing lobbies and the replacement of the amenity center on the lower level. So I would say we are mostly through that in the D.C. market. There's no major ones on the horizon, and I'll see if Jake has anything to add. Jake Stroman : No, nothing to add other than in terms of the repositioning that we just opened at Wisconsin place. It's been met with quite a bit of fanfare. We've had some broker events, and there's definitely some activity and interest in that space now, which is exactly what we wanted to have happened. And at 901 New York Avenue, we will hopefully commence construction on those renovations in the first quarter of next year. And again, a lot of that information has been shared with the brokerage community and with the plus or minus 100,000 square feet of vacant space we have in that asset, we've got some really good activity on that space. Douglas Linde : Bryan, do you want to just sort of talk about 200 Clarendon Street? Bryan Koop : Yes. We're towards the tail end of our investments in execution. Doug mentioned at 200 Claredon, that's a three-year process of design and inclusion with our clients in that building also tied to commitments to renewal. And that is under construction as we speak and going well. At the Prudential Center, our View Boston should be included in upgrade of amenities for our clients. View Boston has a tremendous amount of design factors that were put in by input from the clients, the major clients at the Prudential Center for event space for meeting space, et cetera. And then we finished at 140 Kendrick in the urban edge portfolio to tremendous success, really great feedback on that high utilization. And if we do any others, it will be on the margin in, let's say, one of the possible urban edge larger assets, but it would be insignificant compared to our other investments. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Caitlin Burrows : Hi, good morning everyone. You guys talked about how the tech and life science areas are two where leasing is not quite back to normal, whatever that might be, but that the other areas are. So just thinking of the tech and life science, I think the details are different for each of them. But like what do you think gets them back? How much downsizing is there still to see? But yes, could you talk about that a little bit more? Douglas Linde : Sure. So Camille [ph], this is Doug. So on the tech side, I actually don't think it's about downsizing much anymore, Caitlin, it's really at this point about whether they want to make high value-added investments in their real estate relative to their current platform of human beings and where their spaces are. So as an example, you may see some tech companies, large tech companies making incremental expansions in particular cities because that's where they think talent is. But on the margin, those companies are not growing quickly. We are starting to see dollars, right? And you're seeing this both on the life science side as well as the venture side being raised by companies that will be the next group of organizations that are doing something that to create value for the world at large, the business community, the improvement in the human condition from the perspective of life science and elongating the value of people's lives. That pipeline of money, it takes time to move into the organizations and those organizations to really create for new opportunities for growth from an office perspective. It's been going on. We're hoping that we'll start to pick up, but I'm not smart enough to know when that's going to happen, but we know it will happen. And as we think about our cities and our portfolio, we have a view that there will be more creation of new jobs and new economic activity in life science and in technology broadly thinking, then there will be in traditional financial services to asset management, professional and administrative services. So we're banking on that happening. It's just a question of when, and it's really hard to be able to sort of give you a time frame for that. Owen Thomas : So and just to add a little bit to what Doug said, and I've mentioned this on prior calls, the -- a lot of the large tech companies took a lot of space in '21 and '22. And I think there's a digestion process that's underway, and we can't really forecast when that completes. But again, I would reiterate Doug's point about where the relative growth will be. And then I think the other thing that's interesting that I mentioned in my opening remarks is what are the in-person work policies of the tech companies, and Salesforce just this last month or last couple of months announced that starting in October, they expect almost all their employees to be in the office three to five days a week, and that's a big change in their policy, and they're one of the biggest employers in San Francisco. So I think that's going to have an impact as well. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks for taking the question. Just two clarifications to the comments. I guess, one, you've described sort of East Coast and financial leasing picking up, particularly in New York, but maybe more broadly, how much of that is focused primarily on the premium product versus sort of the general market? In other words, is it still the divergence, or is the market actually picking up? Number one. And then number two, just in your comments on leasing and what that may mean for occupancy. Could you maybe give us more color how much of that is actually renewal? Or how much visibility today do you have on renewals into '25? Thanks. Douglas Linde : Owen, do you want to take the first question? Owen Thomas : Yes. I mean, Vikram, the hiccup is clearly in the premium buildings. I gave you all the statistics on it, the asking rent gap. There's a lot of speculation. Well, as the market improves, this gap is going to be decreased. So that hasn't happened. It's definitely stayed flat, if not grown. I do think in certain locations, though, that are very desirable like around Grand Central Station, the market strength does creep into the -- beyond the premier segment. I think that's true for special locations. Douglas Linde : And Vikram, on your question about sort of renewal versus new. So I -- one of the things I provided in my remarks were the amount of vacant space that we leased in each quarter and what's going forward. And so that number is coming out to somewhere around 40% of our leasing is those types of added occupancy generators, and the rest of it are renewals. And generally, when we're doing renewals, the majority of it is forward, but some of it is relatively broadly speaking sort of in the contractual expiration period of the given year. So we do have a bunch of leasing that we're doing for 2024 expirations, but the majority of that is for 2025 and 2026. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question, comes from the line of Floris van Dijkum from Compass Point LLC. Please go ahead. Floris van Dijkum : Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. Owen, you mentioned something in your comments about potentially transaction activity in the office market maybe starting to pick up and some of the pipeline as we think about it, the foreclosures maybe starting to transact, could you maybe talk a little bit more about that part of the market, what percentage of those assets could be premium or the ones that you would target? And maybe also talk about the disconnect between buyers and sellers? And what does that mean for your -- are people closer to your cost of capital? Or are they -- or expectations on the seller and on the lenders still too high? Owen Thomas : Good morning, Floris. Yes. Floris, first of all, on the foreclosure activity and short sales, loan sales and things like that, there's been very limited activity in those areas for premier workplaces. I think generally, the premier assets, usually they are less leveraged. They're in stronger hands, and if they are leveraged, they're usually performing pretty well. And if they have a problem, the owners are doing whatever they can to fix the loans. So we just haven't seen much foreclosure or distressed activity with the premier assets for all those reasons. That all being said, we've gone -- we've had a deal drought here for a couple of years. And investors, other owners, they got to get on with their business plans and at some point, they need to transact. And so I do think we're seeing increased, as I described in my comments, testing of the market of certain assets, I won't get into any specifics, but there are definitely a handful of buildings right now that are being offered in the market, I think they're premier, and it's just going to be interesting to me if that bid-ask spread gets bridged. Because right now, I do think there's a bid out there for premier assets. And so far, no owners have elected to take it. And I think the second half of this year will be interesting to see if any of those deals come to fruition. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question, comes from the line of Reny Pire from Green Street. Please go ahead. Reny Pire : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just curious, I appreciate your comments on the difference between premier assets versus the broader market averages, but just trying to get a sense for at what point you think you can start to see a pickup in net effective rents for you guys in premier portfolio. Is this something that given the difference in rents between premier and non-premier that you don't think you'll start to see? Or sort of just how should we be thinking about prospects for net effective rent growth? Douglas Linde : So I'm not entirely sure of what you want to use as your from when-to-when point. But I can tell you that net effective rents in our Park Avenue submarket of Manhattan and I'll let Hilary comment are higher today than they were six months ago, and they're higher today than they were a year ago. I can say the same thing definitively about the Back Bay submarket of Boston, but it's going to take a long time for that to occur in markets where there is a significantly larger availability rate because of the nature of having to basically steal market share from existing embedded occupancy. And Hilary, you can maybe comment on sort of transaction costs and what's going on with the rents in Manhattan because it's obviously the clearest example of what's going on from an NER perspective. Hilary Spann : Sure. Thanks, Doug. So in the Park Avenue submarket, which I think is the easiest one to focus on in Manhattan, the vacancy rate, as noted earlier in the call, is less than 8%. And when vacancy drops below, I'd say, about 10%, folks start realizing that if they want to be in that submarket, the pickings are very, very slim and they have to move if they want to get leases done. And that's exactly what we've seen. We first saw face rates rise and concessions remain stable, which is a little bit unusual. In past cycles, you would first see concessions bleed out of the market before face rates began rising. Nevertheless, that's what happened. Face rates have risen. Concessions have remained roughly stable, and so that has caused an increase in net effectives. Now anecdotally and very, very and consistently, we're starting to see concessions move in a little bit. And so we're hopeful that, that means that net effectives will accelerate. But I would just reiterate that there isn't a lot of availability in the strongest submarkets to test that theory against. In addition to the tightness in the Park Avenue submarket and what that's done for net effectives, I would say that it has bled outward in the sense of creating more leasing velocity in adjacent submarkets but those submarkets remain sort of full with concessions. And so I think until those markets demonstrate more tightness in occupancy, we'll see stable concessions and rents flat for the near term. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Peter Abramowitz from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Peter Abramowitz : Yes, thank you. Just noticed that the operating expense growth was a little bit elevated in the same-store portfolio this quarter. Just wondering if you could comment on that, anything you would call out and anything to look for the rest of the year? Michael LaBelle : I actually think our operating expenses were less than we expected them to be. So I think maybe they increased a little bit because there's a little more utilities expenses in the second quarter and repair and maintenance in the second quarter versus the first quarter. We generally get started a little bit slower at the beginning of the year on some of those items. And I think the third quarter is generally higher than the second quarter seasonally as well because of weather conditions again utilities. And I would expect R&M to be a little bit higher too, and that's kind of in line with where our budget is and that it would be probably a little lower in the fourth quarter. Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing our next question, comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Omotayo Okusanya : Hi, yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. A quick question on leverage. Again, our math picked up again a little bit this quarter. You do have kind of debt that matures next year, that'll probably refinance to a higher rate. Just curious how we should kind of think about the trajectory for leverage over the next six to 12 months and also, if the rising leverage is causing any issues, concerns, if I may use those words, with credit rating agencies? Michael LaBelle : So our leverage ratio is impacted by the funding of our development pipeline in a negative way. And then in a positive way when that development pipeline delivers and starts generating EBITDA, right? So every quarter, we're funding developments that aren't going to be completing and delivering for a year or two or three. We have two major developments in Cambridge that are going to be delivering, one, 300 Binney Street delivering in the first quarter of next year. And the other one is 290 Binney Street that is 3x the size of that one, that's going to be delivering in 2026. Both of those are 100% leased. So when that stabilize, it will moderate the leverage. The other developments we -- as was mentioned earlier, we pushed out a little bit, but when they stabilize, they will also moderate the leverage. So that will be, I'd say, impactful. And when we think about leverage, we think about kind of pro forma leverage for those types of investments, which would reduce our leverage probably a full turn or so, plus or minus, which would bring it back down below into the 6.5x to 7.5x range, right, which is where we kind of typically target. So I think we're temporarily higher than that, but we were going to stay higher than that for the next several quarters, the time frame that you just described as we complete this pipeline. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Upal Rana from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Upal Rana : Great, thanks. Good morning. Could you give us a little more detail on the terminations. It looks like one of them was from [indiscernible] at 1100 Winter. But what were the others? And how do these transpire, any timing associated with these would be really helpful. Thank you. Michael LaBelle : So the terminations -- not all of them have occurred. The one that you mentioned was in the media. And one of them -- that one was a pure termination. The square footage in the media was inaccurate, however, it only impacts 20,000 square feet of our occupancy in the near term. The other two, one is the tenant that we're downsizing and relocating within our portfolio. They're staying with us. And we've got another tenant that is 4, 5x their size that is going to be coming in and taking their space as well as other vacant space that is in that building. So that deal is not signed yet, but it's something that we're working on, and we're confident in. And then the last one is a tenant at the Prudential Center, where we have a tenant whose business plan has changed. They've been looking to vacate their space and we have somebody else that wants it. So that tenant is going to be coming in. But the exiting tenant will be leaving in either the third or maybe the beginning of the fourth quarter, probably the third quarter, but the new tenants is not going to be coming until the first quarter of '25. And so that's really the situation we're dealing with on these is the exiting tenants are leaving in 2024, and the new tenants aren't coming until 2025. We also had a similar situation in the New York City market at 601 Lex, where we have an expanding tenant that's looking for space, and we found somebody that would exit. And so that tenant has exited, but the expanding tenant will not be going in until mid-'25. So it's just an example, if you add up all that square footage, it's 100,000 square feet of occupancy that's hurting us this year, where we're really -- it's really a good thing because we're bringing in a client that's a growing client who wants to sign a long-term lease with a client who's closer to their expiration date, maybe their plans have changed. In the case of New York, the client had already signed a lease in another building a couple of years ago because they needed space and so they were able to just consolidate into that building. So every situation is a little bit different. It's all case-by-case. But this is kind of what we do. We try to manage these buildings and work these buildings so we can limit downtime, increase rents and cover exposure. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ronald Kamdem : Hey, just a quick one for me. Look, if I think about this year on the same-store NOI front, some expirations that you guys have been able to backfill quite nicely, but still sort of end up being a headwind to the same-store NOI. So as we roll into next year, maybe can you talk about whether it's commencements or sort of larger exploration, sort of those two aspects, how should we think about as you're rolling into next year sort of potential headwind tailwinds, either from commencements or expiration? Thanks so much. Michael LaBelle : So the same-store NOI this year, which is modestly down, right, is due to occupancy being a little bit lower this year than it was last year, right? We've actually offset that a little bit with rent growth. So rents are actually higher than they were last year, but the occupancy has a much bigger impact than the roll up or the roll down of a lease by 5% or 10%. So as Doug described in his occupancy views and we can't -- we don't know the exact timing, but our expectation is that we will start to have more -- some occupancy growth next year. And if we get occupancy growth, that should go into the same-store, so that will help the same-store. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes our Q&A session. At this time, I would like to turn it back over to Owen Thomas for closing remarks. Owen Thomas : We have no more closing remarks, and I would like to thank everybody for their interest in BXP. Have a good rest of the day. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference call over to your first speaker, Helen Han, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Helen Han : Good morning and welcome to BXP's third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. The press release and supplemental package were distributed last night, and furnished on Form 8-K. In the supplemental package, BXP has reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G. If you did not receive a copy, these documents are available in the Investors section of our website at investors.bxp.com. A webcast of this call will be available for 12 months. At this time, we would like to inform you that certain statements made during this conference call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although BXP believes the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that expectations will be attained.

I'd like to welcome Owen Thomas, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Doug Linde, President; and Mike LaBelle, Chief Financial Officer. During the Q&A portion of our call, Ray Ritchie, Senior Executive Vice President, and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions. We ask that those of you participating in the Q&A portion of the call to please limit yourself to only one question. If you have an additional clarity or follow-up, please feel free to rejoin the queue. I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks. Owen Thomas : Thank you, Helen and good morning everyone. Our performance in the third quarter demonstrated BXP's continued resilience and provided evidence of property and capital market recovery. Our FFO per share was $0.01 above our forecast and in line with market consensus for the third quarter. We completed over 1.1 million square feet of leasing in the quarter, 5% greater than the third quarter of 2023. And for the first three quarters of 2024, our leasing volume was 25% more than levels we achieved in the first three quarters of last year. Weighted average term for office leases signed this past quarter remained long at 7.2 years and we continue to receive awards for our industry-leading work in sustainability. In just the last quarter, Time Magazine and Statista named BXP one of the World's Most Sustainable Companies and NAREIT awarded BXP the Sustainable Design Impact Award for our 140 Kendrick Building A redevelopment project. Now, moving to the economic and operating environment. We believe the most important market forces for BXP, that being interest rates, corporate earnings, return to the office behavior, outperformance of premier workplaces, and valuation in the public and private markets are all currently working in our favor, serving as a tailwind for BXP's performance. The Federal Reserve cut the Fed funds rate 50 basis points at its most recent September meeting and has signaled for two more 25 basis point cuts in 2024 and additional reductions in 2025. The most recently released inflation and GDP growth economic data has signaled the economy is possibly stronger than previously believed and put into question the magnitude and timing of additional Fed funds rate cuts. No matter how this debate resolves itself, the facts are short-term interest rates are coming down, which is very positive for real estate valuations as well as corporate earnings growth, another important driver for BXP's performance given its correlation to leasing activity. After remaining flat for all of 2023, S&P 500 earnings as a proxy for corporate health, are expected to grow 9.9% in 2024. As mentioned before, companies with earnings growth are much more likely to invest, hire, and procure space as demonstrated in BXP's growing leasing volumes this year. We do not see evidence of a looming recession in the decision-making of our clients. While it is true that long-term interest rates, driven more by market forces than Fed behavior have recently been rising, many corporations, particularly smaller ones, use floating rate and shorter-term financing, which are becoming less expensive. Return to office behaviors are clearly improving across the cities where we operate. It has been highly publicized that Amazon is requiring all workers, including support staff to return to the office five days a week starting December 1. Given Amazon's scale and industry presence, this decision could be a harbinger for the future policies of other technology companies. Dell, Salesforce, Starbucks, and other companies have recently announced more stringent in-office work requirements for their employees. KPMG completed a survey this past summer of 1,300 CEOs regarding in-person work policies. 84% of the CEOs believe there will be a full return to office work at their companies within three years, up from 64% of those surveyed just one year ago. The reasons cited for the increase were concerns about diminished collaboration, innovation, and productivity, inadequate supervision and training for younger employees, and the cost of maintaining vacant offices. BXP competes primarily in the premier workplace segment of the office sector, which continues to demonstrate material outperformance. Premier workplaces are defined in CBR's research as the highest quality 6.5% of buildings, representing 13% of total space in our five CBD markets. Direct vacancy for premier workplaces is 13.2% versus 18.7% for the broader market. Likewise, net absorption for premier workplaces has been a positive 6.5 million square feet over the last three years versus a negative 16.7 million square feet for the broader market. Asking rents for premier workplaces are 50% higher than the broader market, a consistent gap from prior quarters. This outperformance is evident in BXP's portfolio where approximately 90% of our NOI comes from assets located in CBDs that are predominantly premier workplaces. These CBD assets are 90.1% occupied and 92.1% leased as of the end of the third quarter. Lastly, from a timing perspective, valuation changes in the public real estate industry, which are determined by daily trading, lead valuation changes in the private market, which are largely appraisal based. In the first three quarters of 2024, publicly-traded office companies generated a return of 30%. While in the private market, as measured by the NCREIF Index, which is the best proxy for unleveraged private market values, office returns were a negative 7% over the same period. In other words, public markets are trading higher based on expectations of a recovery in the office sector, while the private market appraisal-based marks are still dropping in an attempt to catch up to current market conditions. As a result, BXP has the opportunity to make increasingly accretive private market investments, both in acquisitions and in selective developments that underwrite to yield premiums versus pre-pandemic levels. Regarding the real estate private equity capital markets, office sales volume in the third quarter provided evidence of a pickup in activity. Specifically, volume for significant U.S. office sales was $8.2 billion, 15% greater than the second quarter of 2024 and 32% above the third quarter of last year. Lower short-term interest rates, increased leasing activity for certain assets and locations, and better access to debt financing were the drivers. An important change in the environment has been the increasing availability of debt financing at scale for office assets in the CMBS market with relatively attractive pricing. Very recent examples of CMBS execution include a $3.5 billion 57% loan-to-value five-year refinancing for Rockefeller Center at a fixed rate of 6.2% and a $750 million, 43% loan-to-value five-year refinancing of 277 Park Avenue at a fixed rate of 7%. Office sales this past quarter for assets with comparability to BXP's portfolio include 730/750 Main Street, a fully leased 219,000 square foot multi-use building in the Kendall Center District of Cambridge sold for $362 million or $1,650 a square foot and a 5.7% initial cap rate. A leasehold interest was conveyed from the landowner to a private life science real estate owner and developer. In Santa Monica, 2220 Colorado Avenue, a fully leased 225,000 square foot office building sold for $185 million or $819 a square foot and a 7.1% initial cap rate. A pension adviser was the seller and a fund manager of the buyer. 799 Broadway, a 177,000 square foot new office building located in Midtown South is under contract to sell for $255 million or $1,400 a square foot and a 5.3% initial cap rate. The building is 71% leased and the yield is estimated to be approximately 7% upon stabilization. A private REIT sold the building to a European family office. Moving to BXP's capital allocation activities. We remain active in pursuing acquisitions from both real estate owners and lenders. Our pipeline of potential opportunities is growing, including building and node acquisitions, sites with near-term pre-leasing potential, and new residential developments. No agreements are imminent, but we are encouraged by the activity. We are in active negotiations for the disposition of three non-income-producing sites, which, if successful, should close in 2025 and generate over $70 million of proceeds. For our development pipeline, we delivered into service 180 CityPoint, a 329,000 square foot lab building, which is 43% leased located in our CityPoint Park in Waltham. Though initial leasing completed exceeded our underwriting, the market softened before the asset was fully leased. The opening of Skymark, our 508-unit luxury residential tower development at Reston Town Center, continues to go well, having leased 35% of the units at the base of the building and we believe we are on track to achieve our underwriting in terms of rents and schedule. We have been able to accelerate the completion of 300 Binney Street, a fully leased 236,000 square foot lab redevelopment in Kendall Center in Cambridge, and we will deliver the project to our client and into service in the fourth quarter. We continue to push forward with several residential projects, primarily on land we control that are being entitled and designed and for which we intend to partially fund with joint venture equity capital. Lastly, we broke ground on the Grand Central Madison Concourse Access phase of 343 Madison Avenue, located two blocks south of JPMorgan's new headquarters building and one block north of One Vanderbilt. 343 Madison competes with the Park Avenue submarket of New York City, which, given its access to Grand Central Terminal one-stop commute is under 8% vacant with no block of direct space over 100,000 square feet available and is arguably the strongest office submarket in the United States. 343 Madison, which BXP has been working on for over 10 years, is the only fully entitled ready-to-commence workplace development located in the core of Midtown and we are having constructive conversations with a handful of potential anchor clients. When complete, the building will comprise 942,000 square feet and includes state-of-the-art sustainability features as well as direct escalator access into Grand Central Terminal. We hope to launch this approximately $2 billion project next year, where as a reminder, BXP owns a 55% interest. BXP continues to execute a significant development pipeline with nine office, lab, retail and residential projects underway as of the end of the third quarter, which we expect will contribute to BXP's external FFO per share growth over time. These projects aggregate approximately 2.7 million square feet and $2.1 billion of BXP investment with $1 billion remaining to be funded. So, in conclusion, BXP continues to leverage its key strengths, which are our commitment to premier workplaces and our clients as many competitors disinvest from the office sector; a strong balance sheet with ready access to capital in the public and private debt and equity markets; and one of the highest quality portfolios of premier workplaces in the U.S. assembled over several decades of intentional development, acquisitions, and dispositions. BXP continues to display resilience with a growing leasing pipeline as well as stability in FFO per share and dividend level, and we are well-positioned to continue to gain market share in both assets and clients, while benefiting from a constructive environment of lower interest rates, higher corporate earnings growth, more workers returning to their offices, continued outperformance of the premier workplace sector, and a very competitive cost of capital. Over to Doug. Douglas Linde : Good morning, everybody. So, Owen noted that our leasing in 2024 through the end of the third quarter is 25% higher than 2023. And during this period, we have completed 3.3 million square feet of signed leases. Post Q3, our active pipeline of leases under documentation sits at 1.53 million square feet as compared to 1.39 million square feet post the second quarter. We've done about 315,000 square feet of that pool since October 1st, executed leases. If we execute most of the remaining leases during the fourth quarter, we will end the year at over 4.5 million square feet of transactions. Our January 2024 guidance assumed 3.5 million square feet. Exclusive of our leases in documentation, we also have an additional transactions under discussion totaling just over 1.5 million square feet in the pipeline that will cede our 2025 activity, about 50% of that involves currently vacant space. As of September 30th, we have 1.04 million square feet of signed leases on vacant space that has not yet commenced. There is now a 210 basis point difference between our occupied space and our leased space. No doubt the analyst community is looking keenly towards 2025 and 2026 occupancy. We will provide our occupancy guidance for 2025 on our next call. However, we can provide the following inputs as you think about your own models. Our Q4 2024 and full year 2025 expirations totaled 3.7 million square feet. We have signed leases that we will recognize revenue on of 476,000 square feet during the fourth quarter of 2024 and 483,000 square feet for 2025, totaling 959,000, which creates an uncovered exposure, if you will, of 2.74 million square feet. Our pipeline of leases in negotiation covers an additional 305,000 square feet of currently vacant space and 395,000 square feet of renewals, all of this set to commence in 2024 and 2025. Obviously, the remainder involve early renewals with expirations after 2025. This leaves pro forma revenue commencing leasing for the next five quarters of about 2 million square feet for us to be flat for the in-service portfolio. Additional leasing with revenue starting in 2025 will be additive. Each of our regional EVPs are in the process of building their business plans for 2025, and this will be the basis for the total leasing volumes embedded in our guidance when we talk to you next time. If you're wondering about the large known 2024, 2025 expirations, which is often a question we get, the largest are 312,000 square feet at Weston Corporate Center, which has been leased by Biogen, but sublet for use, 200,000 square feet at 1000 Winter Street in Waltham; 350,000 square feet at 200 Fifth Avenue, we own 28% of that, two 70,000 square foot law firm leases at Embarcadero Center, and 260,000 square feet at Reston Corporate Center, which is leased to the GSA. This last building is the site for our next multiphase development in Reston Town Center, and the building will be taken out of service on January 1st, 2025. We also have active developments that will be added to our in-service portfolio in 2025 with availability that is noted in our supplemental materials, 360 Park Avenue South, 651 Gateway, and Reston NXT Phase 2. Our BXP regional teams are spending a lot of energy pursuing alternative uses for our suburban land portfolio, which includes vacant office buildings for which the highest and best use may not be waiting for a recovery in office leasing. We are now deep in a public re-permitting process for 17 Hartwell Avenue in Lexington to allow for 312 multifamily units. A similar process is underway for our site containing two office buildings at World Gate in Herndon, Virginia, where we are working on a rezoning for 359 units in 99 townhomes, and the Shady Grove Office Park in Rockville, Maryland, with the first phase including 360 multifamily units and 136 townhomes. Additional land sites in the Bay Area, Waltham, Northern Virginia, and Northern New Jersey are being actively evaluated. This quarter, we took two buildings out of service that we will work to re-entitle, in Waltham and in Northern Virginia. During our last call, I explained that we would see up to a 40 basis point decline in our occupancy for Q3 due to the addition of our partially leased development at 180 CityPoint, Owen noted that. With a slight reduction in the in-service portfolio, we only experienced a 10 basis point deterioration ending the quarter at 87%. We expect to improve by 20 to 30 basis points during the fourth quarter in spite of the delivery of 103 CityPoint, which is 100% available. This quarter, we completed 74 transactions with 32 lease renewals for 681,000 square feet and 42 with new clients encompassing 427,000 square feet. Activity was concentrated in Boston with more than 58% of our total leasing volumes. We completed 647,000 square feet in Boston, 143,000 square feet in New York, 155,000 square feet in D.C., and 163,000 on the West Coast. 10 clients expanded into 142,000 additional square feet, and we had four contractions totaling 100,000 square feet. The majority of the client expansions this quarter came from our Back Bay financial firms. The only significant contraction in the portfolio came from a tech company downsizing in Waltham, they were about 70,000 square feet and went to 150, and we have re-leased all of the space that they vacated. We continue to see downsizing of our legal firm clients on the West Coast and in D.C., and we experienced one in Embarcadero Center, which was a renewal and downsizing this quarter. We executed only one transaction over 55,000 square feet and two others in excess of 45,000 square feet. Our leasing activity this quarter was very granular. As reported in our supplemental, the mark-to-market of the leases that commenced this quarter, so they may have been signed in 2020 or 2021 or 2022 or 2023, 900,000 square feet was down about 4.5% and the transaction cost averaged $11.83 per year compared to about $11 last quarter. The overall mark-to-market of the starting cash rent on leases executed this quarter of the 1.1 million square feet relative to the previous in-place cash rents was actually up 9% with the primary contribution coming from the Boston area. The starting cash rents on leases we signed during this quarter on second-generation space were up 19% in Boston, 10% in New York and then down 11% in D.C. and 3% on the West Coast. Owen's comments about the state of the economy and the zeitgeist around the importance of in-person work with colleagues is translating into improvements in leasing activity. The level of improvement and the source of the incremental demand continue to vary greatly by market. I would also note that decision-making continues to be slow. And while more transactions are being completed, the process takes time, lots of time. Our views this quarter are pretty consistent with the commentary we provided during 2024. The submarkets with the largest concentration of users from financial institutions, alternative asset managers, professional service organizations, and law firms are showing the most consistent pickup in activity. And as we saw this quarter, in some circumstances, these clients are expanding absorption of space. Concessions are flat and taking market rents have risen during the year. So, if we think about New York City, the sub-8% availability in the Park Avenue submarket is a direct reflection of these users growing and competing for limited blocks of space. We have no availability at 399 Park Avenue or 601 Lexington. When clients need to expand in these buildings, we proactively discuss possible terminations with their neighbors. While 599 Lex has always been not quite Park Avenue, in strong markets like this, the building is one of the first to experience the spillover of Park Avenue tenants that are unable to find space. We are now in lease with a Park Avenue tenant that was unable to grow in its current building for a couple of floors. Our most active building in New York during the quarter was the General Motors Building. We completed 58,000 square feet of transactions, including the addition of a new private equity client and the expansion of another. Our other availability in this market is at 510 Madison, where we are in the middle of an amenity refresh. This building tends to lend itself to smaller financial firms given the 12,000 square foot floor plate. This particular market segment of demand has been slower to make decisions. Year-to-date, leases executed by technology tenants in Manhattan has still been pretty light. We have seen a pickup in activity among technology tenants touring the market, and this is encouraging given our current availability at 360 Park Avenue South and the availability we will have at 200 Fifth Avenue. We are in active conversations with tenants at both buildings, but none have progressed to a lease in negotiation. The most active building in Boston as well as in the entire BXP portfolio during the quarter was 200 Clarendon Street. We completed more than 460,000 square feet of leases. Virtually all the leases were with existing clients in the alternative asset management industry and 50% of those clients added additional space. We also completed over 116,000 square feet of leasing in our Boston Urban Edge portfolio. This was made up of eight separate transactions and seven were with new clients for BXP. Our portfolio is uniquely positioned both in terms of quality and availability of capital for investment in new tenant installations. Here, the demand came from a national retailer, a few life science companies with office requirements, a small technology firm, and a fund manager. We didn't execute any leases in our new life science developments this quarter. Life science clients in Greater Boston continue to display very little urgency about any potential new requirements or relocations. We have had tours from some larger users, but the requirements are for late 2026 and 2027 occupancy. Year-to-date, there have been a handful of leases signed on shelf space that total about 300,000 square feet in the markets outside of Cambridge and Boston. Our Reston portfolio was responsible for 55% of our executed leases during the quarter in the D.C. region. Leasing activity and tenant demand growth continues to come primarily from two industry areas, cybersecurity and defense contracting. This quarter, we had a growing cyber firm more than double its square footage. This client signed its initial lease in Reston Town Center for 9,000 square feet in 2020 and has grown six-fold in the last four years. One of the great advantages of BXP's large holdings in Reston is our ability to accommodate the growth of our clients. We saw a pickup of smaller requirements in our CBD D.C. portfolio this quarter, which was good news. We had two clients expand, one at 2200 Penn and another at Capital Gallery and completed leases with two new customers at 1330 Connecticut Avenue. The district's private sector tenant demand continues to be dominated by the legal industry. Many of these potential law firm clients are not satisfied with the existing inventory, either due to the product quality, condition, or the asset's financial condition. While in almost every case, the law firm renewal or relocation is resulting in a smaller requirement, which is leading to negative absorption, these firms prefer to be in the top refurbished amenity-rich, well-capitalized buildings, which is creating a tight micro market. There are limited opportunities in the market and no appetite from traditional lenders to finance any new construction, which has traditionally been the outlet for law firm lease expirations. Our availability at 2200 Penn and 901 New York Avenue will fare well, and we are actually in lease documentation for a late 2026 known expiration at 2200 Penn today. The San Francisco CBD also continues to act as the financial center of the West Coast with its own set of asset managers, including private equity, venture, hedge funds, and specialized fund managers and their financial and legal advisers. This is the source of the bulk of the transactions in the market today from a leasing perspective. Tour activity from these non-tech clients has improved during the year. On a comparative basis, San Francisco is seeing much more demand in 2024 than it did in 2023. There continue to be lots of small clients actively looking for space, and we are seeing these deals at 535 Mission and Embarcadero Center. We have completed or in negotiations on five leases totaling about 40,000 square feet at 535 Mission. This will cover a third of the availability of the building, but we still have another 80,000 square feet to go. At Embarcadero Center, we are in discussions with a number of existing and potentially relocating law firms. In each case, the requirement is a downsizing relative to the current footprint. We will retain the majority of our clients, albeit with space reductions. We are adding other new customers, but the transaction sizes are small, so gaining occupancy takes time. Additional lease reductions from larger tenants upon lease expiration in the market, JPMorgan is the latest, which is stemming from their acquisition of First Republic, continue to mute the positive demand emanating from the AI organizations that continue to look for additional space. During the quarter, the market got the long-awaited announcement of OpenAI's 300,000 square foot expansion in Mission Bay. And it's great that Airbnb renewed their headquarters at 888 Brannon, but expansion requirements from large technology tenants are still sparse in San Francisco. Tenant tour activity is improving at our Mountain View research R&D buildings where we have about 215,000 square feet of vacancy and it's uniquely attractive product. We are in lease for 26,000 square feet with a healthcare diagnostics company for a vacant building. We completed a renewal with an automotive company and recently have issued a multiple full building proposal. This is a significant improvement from last year and from last quarter. These buildings are designed for companies that are making some kind of device, be it a car sensor, a photovoltaic panel or a medical device. They don't compete with the large multi-storey office product that has flooded the market. In summary, 2024 is shaping up to be a better-than-expected year relative to overall leasing at BXP. Leasing in our development properties continues to lag, but these are some of the highest quality workplaces in their prospective markets, and they will lease. We may not be in a clear positive absorption market, but demand continues to grow, and we will continue to gain market share. Mike? Michael LaBelle : Excellent. Thank you, Doug and good morning everybody. I'm going to start with a few comments on the debt markets, and then I'll plan to cover the details of our third quarter performance and the changes to our 2024 earnings guidance as well as provide some insight into several of the moving pieces that you should be aware of for 2025. We completed multiple transactions this quarter and continue to have strong access to the debt markets. This quarter, we exercised our right to extend our $334 million mortgage loan secured by 100 Causeway Street in Boston for an additional year at SOFR plus 148 basis points. We also extended $300 million of mortgage financing for Santa Monica Business Park that was scheduled to mature in July 2025 at attractive terms. We bifurcated the loan into a $100 million unsecured term loan and a $200 million mortgage loan. The unsecured loan is for one year with three one-year extensions, and we reduced the pricing at closing to SOFR plus 105 basis points, and the $200 million mortgage loan will be priced at SOFR plus 160 basis points and matures in 2028. The secured debt markets have shown meaningful improvement this quarter for high-quality, well-leased office buildings at leverage points of 50% or less. Credit spreads have compressed, and there is significantly more liquidity in the CMBS markets for both conduit and SASB executions. The SASB market, which is where most large loans in excess of $500 million are financed, was nonexistent in 2023. It reopened in early 2024, but with pricing for the AAA tranches at spreads in the low 200s. More recently, AAA spreads have improved into the mid-100s, which results in a significant improvement in overall pricing and conduit pricing can be even tighter. This trend is a strong signal of improved liquidity in the sector, while the financing market remains challenged for buildings with vacancy, short weighted average lease terms or higher leverage. We have several mortgage financings that are part of our 2025 capital plan, and we plan to take advantage of the improved conditions in the market and extend term. These deals include our $250 million loan for Marriott's new headquarters building in Bethesda and two mortgages totaling $487 million on our Hub on Causeway development in Boston. We own a 50% interest in each of these assets. In the unsecured market, we issued $850 million of 10-year bonds in late August at a 5.75% coupon. We're holding the cash proceeds pending repayment of an $850 million bond that is expiring in January 2025. As we described in our issuance press release in August, we reduced our 2024 FFO guidance by $0.02 per share to account for the incremental net interest expense associated with this bond issuance that was not in our prior earnings guidance. Now, turning to our earnings results for the quarter. We announced third quarter funds from operations of $1.81 per share, that's $0.01 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance as adjusted for our recent bond deal. The primary driver behind our earnings beat is from lower-than-projected G&A expenses. Our portfolio performed in line with our expectations for the quarter. Doug described the improvement in our leasing activity, both in signed leases and in our pipeline. As we get into the third and fourth quarters of the year, most of this activity will not have a revenue impact in 2024 due to the lag between signing a lease and achieving occupancy and revenue recognition. Renewals have an immediate impact, but we generally know who is renewing in advance and the revenue is included in our forecast. My point is that you should not be surprised that our portfolio performance is closely aligned with our 2024 forecast this late in the year. For the full year 2024, we're narrowing our guidance range for FFO to $7.09 to $7.11 per share. Adjusted for the $0.02 of dilution from our bond deal, our new range maintains the midpoint of our updated guidance. While we will provide full guidance for 2025 in January, there are a couple of items where we have seen variations in a number of the 2025 models from the analyst community that you should consider. First is interest income, where we project lower cash balances and interest rates next year. Since our bond offering in August, we have been holding $850 million in cash that we are going to utilize in January 2025 for the payoff of our expiring bond of the same size. We're also using cash balances in combination with operating cash flow to fund our developments. We expect our average cash holdings to be approximately $800 million lower in 2025 than they were in 2024. We expect our interest expense will be flat to modestly lower next year from the burn-off of fair value interest expense and the impact of lower SOFR rates on our floating rate debt portfolio. We also will be vacating Reston Corporate Center, which is the project Doug described in his comments. We will be taking these two older low-rise buildings totaling 260,000 square feet out of service on January 1st, 2025, when the full building lease expires. We have entitlements to build over 2 million square feet of mixed-use commercial and multifamily residential on the site as the next phase of our incredibly successful Reston Town Center. This will lead to a significant increase in density where we expect to create incremental value and earnings over time. From our development pipeline, we will have a full year of contribution from delivering 300 Binney Street this quarter and the Dick's House of Sports store we delivered in the second quarter. We will also have incremental income from the completion and lease-up of our Skymark Residential development in Reston, where our ownership is 20%. Overall, we had a solid quarter with a continuation of strong leasing momentum and our volumes year-to-date up 25% over last year. We modestly beat our FFO guidance for the quarter and maintained our full year earnings expectations. That completes our formal remarks. Operator, can you open the line for questions? Operator : Thank you sir. [Operator Instructions] And I show the first question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Nick Yulico : Thanks. I guess just turning to the leasing markets, can you just give a little bit more feel for what kind of needs to change in San Francisco, West Coast, maybe Boston suburbs as well, where I think that's been more of a sort of vacancy drag on the portfolio? What needs to change for that dynamic to improve in those markets? Douglas Linde : So, I'll give a general statement, and then I'll let Rod and Bryan give their perspectives on San Francisco and the Boston suburbs in particular. In general, we need to see more technology and life science demand come back to the markets, which means we need to see both company formations with capital, be it private or public, right? A lot of biotech companies are sort of hoping to go public, but aren't able to go public. And then we need to sort of see the new ideas generated into new jobs and therefore, new kinds of businesses being formed. And that has really not been part of the sort of demand picture in either market in 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024. It's been sort of more of a retrenching of large tech and I would say, a slight downsizing from both technology and life science. So, Rod, you can sort of talk about the CBD of San Francisco and then Bryan can talk about Waltham. Rodney Diehl : Yes. Thanks, Nick. Good morning Nick. I would just add to Doug's comment that I think what needs to happen, at least in San Francisco, the demand has picked up certainly. So, as you heard, we've got good activity from multiple sectors and the traditional tenants still dominate, but there's plenty of technology companies that are out in the market. But I think what needs to happen before you're going to see some meaningful change in some of the statistics is going to be a burn off of the sublease availability. That still is an overhang. There's about 8.2 million square feet of sublease space. I would say that, the best space has been spoken for. There's still some buildings that are out there, but that's still causing us to compete with sublease space, which is difficult. So I think before you're going to see some changes in the direct vacancy and particularly in our buildings, some of those better sublease spaces need to be leased up, which is happening. So it's been happening for the last couple of years. Owen Thomas : In Boston, I'd say, first off, no surprise, Doug did an excellent job of underwriting the total market and where we're at. So I encourage you to re-look at those things because it was spot on. I would say with our Urban Edge, and you've heard us say this before, the Urban Edge is much different than, let's say, the 495 Ring Road and then in particular, the P2 corridor, as we call it, between the Pike and Route 2 on I-95 is much different. The theme for us is drastic differences. So there's a drastic difference between the P2 corridor and anything else in the suburbs in terms of activity and also rental rates. And then the other is product. There's a drastic difference between our product at CityPoint, the premier space that all our leadership has talked about today and let's say, the rest of the market. And it's important to note that these markets product is vintage now over 50 years old. And there's a tremendous amount of that, that's dragging down things. But the difference between CityPoint premier office space at 77 CityPoint, 190, 230, 10 and 20 CityPoint is much different. And that includes what we see in Reston, which is the cluster of amenities. And that is the biggest difference that we're seeing. There's drastic differences between product and then also location. Nick Yulico : Thank you. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Steve Sakwa : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. I guess, Owen, you sort of talked about 343 Madison and the work that you're doing there. But also you mentioned the disappointment in not seeing some of the leasing happening at places like 360 Park. So I guess the question is, how are you thinking about the pre-leasing and the risks that you take at 343 Madison to move forward in light of the fact that some of the development has been kind of slower to lease up than you would like? Owen Thomas : Yes. I think I'm going to turn it over to Hilary. The big picture answer to your question, Steve, is that north of 42nd Street is primarily a financial services, legal services market and it's very strong and particularly with the access to Grand Central. You go south of 42nd Street, much more tech-driven with the issues that Doug described. But let me turn this over to Hilary. Hilary Spann : Thank you, Owen. Hi, Steve. I would just echo what Owen has said, and I would add to that, that there have been several sizable leasing transactions completed in the third quarter in Midtown proper, meaning north of 42nd Street as well as a very large lease that printed post the end of the quarter. So Bloomberg signed a renewal for 1 million square feet. Ares signed a lease for 300,000 square feet. Willkie Farr signed a 315,000 square foot lease. All of these leases were in Midtown proper, and they're all at scale. So there is demand from larger tenants in the marketplace. And I think it's just a question of matching the right demand profile client with the premier workplace that we're planning to build. Very different proposition in Midtown South. The market, as Owen alluded to, is dominated by tech and media tenancy. We are starting to see some more traditional clients poke around in Midtown South as they are figuring out that there's very little high-quality space in Midtown available. But I would say the bulk of that leasing demand continues to be from the more traditional tenant base and tech and media simply have not been adding jobs and space the way that finance and the industries that support it have in Midtown proper. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. John Kim : Good morning. We're trying to figure out the occupancy trajectory going forward. Doug, you gave very helpful building blocks on what's the puts and takes over the next few quarters. But at the end of the day, you mentioned 2 million square feet of leases need to be signed over the next five quarters with commencements in the next five quarters for occupancy to remain flat. And I'm wondering how realistic that is. This year, you're on pace to sign 4.5 million square feet of leases and how much of that is commencing this year? Douglas Linde : I can't answer your latter question because I don't know the actual number in terms of all the things that were signed this year, how much has commenced. We are, I would say, at this point, optimistic that we will sign 2-plus million square feet of leases that will have revenue commencing in 2024 and 2025 so that our occupancy will be at a minimum be flat. I'm hoping that when we go through our planning process with our EPs, we're going to see some opportunities that will be better than that. But again, we're not giving guidance for 2025 at the moment. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Spector from Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Spector : Great. Just back on the West Coast, and I know it's -- you have smaller presence there. But given it's such an important question topic, and I know you discussed it already, but there is a lot of skepticism over the latest return to office mandates, in particular, tech. I know earlier in the year, when we did our tour, we kept hearing tech, they're just not using the stick to bring people back. And so I know, Owen, you talked about that a little bit. Doug, you talked about some of the challenges in San Francisco. Are there lessons learned from New York City? Or do we really need to stop comparing New York to West Coast? West Coast just there are truly just different dynamics, and it's going to take several years for tech firms to really figure out their space needs. Douglas Linde : So Jeff, my answer is I do think there is a cultural difference between the business community on the West Coast and the business community in cities like New York and Boston. And there is a differentiation. However, that differentiation, I don't believe, will result in any difference in terms of the utilization of space from the company's perspective. It may reduce the number of days any particular company demands their people come to work. And so we are seeing, as Owen said, a lot of organizations saying whatever we have been doing is no longer working for us. and we need to be more aggressive about asking our associates to be more present more of the time. I believe we will see month after month over the next number of months and years, a continual pick up on the West Coast. And clearly, the companies that are involved in the artificial intelligence industry, large scale have said the speed of which we are needing to do all of the work that's required to be \" on top and a winner means we need space and we need our people to be in that space. And as that sector of the economy starts to dominate the culture out there, I would hope that we will see an even larger pickup in other companies responding to the need from a talent perspective relative to productivity. And Rod, you may have a different perspective. Rodney Diehl : I don't have a different perspective. I completely agree. And I can tell you that it has picked up. And Salesforce, in particular, has -- as of October 1, that's when they kind of instituted their policy of getting people back in the office. And they are tracking that data very closely with our team at the building. And it seems to have -- if you were down there in that building today and you were sitting in that lobby, you would feel a different vibe than you did a year ago. And then one other small anecdote coming in from the East Bay, which is where I live, the BART system, which is our light rail train system, the train station that I go to, there's 3 basic parking lots. And the third lot, which was most distant, had very few cars in it for the last few years. That lot is filling up on days, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and that hadn't happened before. So they're going somewhere, they're going into the city. And so I think we are seeing a shift. Douglas Linde : And Jeff, I'll just add one other thing. And again, these are -- this is very anecdotal, but -- but up in Seattle, we've done two leases at Madison Center in 2024. Both of them have been from branches of technology companies that gave space back early during the pandemic and when they changed their policy relative to return to work, needed more space and took an additional floor in both cases at Madison Center. So that does not suggest that any of these companies are going to demand everyone comes back and they're going to start firing people if they don't. We don't know how the stick is going to work. But there are clearly organizations that have said in the technology business on the West Coast that we need to have our people in space, and we want to have the space for those people. Jeffrey Spector : Thank you. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Anthony Paolone from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Anthony Paolone : Thank you. Owen, you mentioned in your comments, public markets leading private markets and maybe alluding to opportunities to invest. So can you maybe give us a sense as to where you think or where you see BXP's capital cost being versus maybe what you think you might make on something like 343 Madison or on investment opportunities you might be getting shown? And if we should really start to think about external growth in 2025? Owen Thomas : Yes. BXP's look-through cap rate today at current share price is in the mid -- call it, mid-6s. In terms of development yields in New York before the pandemic, development yields were about 6%. And today, I think they're materially higher than that, and that's certainly going to be our target. And then on acquisitions, there have been very few deals done in this premier workplace segment, although there were a couple last quarter, which I provided in my remarks. And again, it's a little bit all over the place, depends on the leasing status and ground lease and all those types of things. But it feels to me like the bid at least is in kind of the high 6%s to 7% cap rate on a stabilized basis. So that's where the market is in terms of the acquisitions, there haven't been a lot of takers of that. In other words, sellers are not accepting that price, and that's why there haven't been that many transactions, but that could clearly change. I also think transaction activity will probably go up in the coming quarters because there is more availability of financing, particularly in the CMBS market, which I described. Anthony Paolone : Thank you. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Blaine Heck : Great. Thanks. So along those same lines, in the past, you guys have been pretty transparent about your desire to grow in some of the markets that you've entered most recently like L.A. and Seattle. I guess can you just talk about whether your appetite to grow in those markets has changed at all given the tougher operating environment? And just whether you guys are seeing any interesting investment opportunities in those markets? Or do you think you'll focus your acquisition efforts on markets that are a little bit healthier now? Owen Thomas : Yeah. Our strategy top down is to establish a perimeter, which we have with the six markets that we operate in, including some in a couple of cases like Waltham and Reston, places that are outside the CBD. So that's the top-down strategy. In terms of what we actually invest in, it's bottoms up. We're opportunistic. What can we find, what's available, what can our teams generate? We're going to look for and execute on those investments that have the best risk return opportunities. So we're -- we certainly look at where the contributions come from the various regions to our overall result, but we want to be opportunistic in the way we do deals within the perimeter that I described. The last thing I'd say on this is there are opportunities in the West, but they're clearly harder to underwrite. When you're looking at a building in New York or Boston, for example, or, say, in the Reston area, it's easier to have a view on what are the rents, what can the leasing velocity be? What should we expect? Whereas in the West, particularly for some types of assets, that's more challenging because the leasing is slower. So I'm not suggesting we won't do or try to do deals in the West, but they're harder to underwrite. Blaine Heck : Thank you. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Griffin from Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Griffin : Great. Thanks. I'm curious if you can give any color just on the Bain renewal in Boston and whether or not they were a potential candidate for that development you've got potential in the Back Bay, 171 Dardmouth. Did you just need maybe more of a commitment in terms of rents or weighted average lease term to maybe justify moving them over to the new development? Just any color there would be helpful. Douglas Linde : So I'm not going to comment about what Bain's decision-making process was. Suffice it to say that a new building construction in Boston today probably cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $1,400 to $1,600 a square foot depending on whether or not you want to include a value for land. And if you need a return and Owen described sort of our development expectations, that will create a rent that is materially higher than the rents that are achievable in existing both under construction and recently delivered new buildings in the financial district and the level of rents that we can currently command in the Back Bay. And so I think the timing at the moment for that new development in Boston doesn't really pencil relative to where existing rents are. Now, if the SOFR curve goes from 5.5% to 3% and lending conditions go from 350 to 400 to non-existent over to 150 basis points over and there is some softening in some of the inputs of the building and the building cost comes down, there's probably a different conversation that could happen at some point in the future with a number of tenants in our Back Bay portfolio about wanting to go to the new building at 170 Dartmment Street. And we hope to start that building at some point, but it's not sort of part of the calculus in 2025. Michael Griffin : Thank you. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey, good morning. Just a question on the D.C. market. You guys made some positive comments on what's going on in D.C. and certainly echoes what we saw when we were down that market earlier in the month. Just looking at twofold. One, as you think about the rents that are rolling in D.C., directionally, do you see those rents, especially in the district rolling up, rolling down? Just trying to get a sense given that this market has had a tough time over the past decade. And then two, is there willingness -- are the tenants themselves willing to pay the rents necessary for new development? Or do you see this market as really just trying to cram into the existing buildings that you have right now? Douglas Linde : Yes. So Alex, thanks for the question. I'm going to answer the first part, and then I'll let Jake Stroman answer the second part. So -- in the District of Columbia, every lease that we signed has somewhere between a 2.25% and a 3% annual bump. And generally, those leases are at a minimum of 10 years and generally 15 to 20 years. And so if you compound the rents that where we started with those rents, it is almost impossible to have a rent roll up in D.C. on a like building. However, and I'll let Jake describe sort of where the new market might be for rents in new buildings and how that might impact sort of what the opportunity might be for us. Jake? Jake Stroman : Yes, sure. Thanks, Doug. Hello, Alex. Look, Alex, there's no doubt that the preeminent office space and the demand for preeminent office space in the district is driven by the legal industry, as Doug alluded to in his comments. And there are definitely opportunities that exist -- and there are active prospects in the market that are looking for better amenitized and well-located new high-quality product. And so we do believe that there will be opportunities in the D.C. market, whereby, hopefully, BXP is able to capitalize on those opportunities. Douglas Linde : And just -- and the rent stake that would be necessary for those are what compared to where sort of existing product is? Alexander Goldfarb : Yes, they're probably 15% to 20% higher than existing sort of trophy quality product that exists in the market. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Floris Van Dijkum from Compass Point LLC. Please go ahead. Floris Van Dijkum : Hey, Owen, guys thanks for taking my public you sort of alluded, if I look at the public, and you sort of alluded to this a little bit earlier in your remarks, the public office owners, not all of them, by the way, but some of them like yourselves are getting a green light to grow externally from the market. You're all trading at a premium to consensus and estimated NAV. What -- but you have this issue about the lack of transactions in the market as well. How do you think about the timing or potential, what are the catalysts that are going to need to occur for transaction activity to pick up? And how do you think about your cost of equity to fund those potential transactions going forward? Owen Thomas : Yes. Well, I mentioned -- I answered the second question earlier, which is our look-through cap rate today, depending on different models, but it's in the mid-6s. In terms of what is going to spark new activity, I think one of several things or multiple of several things. One, lower interest rates would certainly help. I talked about the -- a new market phenomenon, which is very constructive, which is the opening of the CMBS market for the office sector. I think that will help buyers create liquidity to buy things. So I think that's a catalyst. And then I think lastly, fatigue on the sell side. You're an owner of an asset, you have a business strategy, you want to downsize your office exposure, you want to sell a particular building, you want to reuse the capital to do something else, you have goals. And at some point, you're going to move forward and try to accomplish those goals. So I think that will be part of the calculus going forward as well. Floris Van Dijkum : Thank you. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Caitlin Burrows : Hi. Good morning everyone. I know you aren't giving 2025 guidance, so you're probably less inclined to talk further out. But with that said, I guess, bigger picture, as you consider occupancy improving, development coming online, in-place debt being refinanced, any comments you can give on kind of the trajectory of FFO? Or could you quantify any of those building blocks? Douglas Linde : I will just say, Caitlin, that we are an optimistic group here, and we believe that the markets will continue to recover, and we believe that we will pick up a meaningful amount of occupancy over time. And our average rent is somewhere around $80 a square foot, and we should hopefully get to a stabilized level at some point of 400-plus basis points or more of occupancy gain. And you're talking about 80x a 50 million square foot portfolio. So every 100 basis points is 500,000 square feet. So you're talking about 80x 2 million square feet of space. That's a significant amount of growth, both in occupancy and therefore, internally. Owen just described, hopefully, the ability to do some external transactions, which we would believe would be accretive, maybe not a lot in the short, short term, but certainly on a medium- to long-term basis. So we're optimistic about the growth of our earnings over time. And I am sort of the outlier of BXP relative to where long-term interest rates are, but it's clear that short-term interest rates are coming down, which is a good thing. So I think that, that will sort of be a little bit of a sort of neutral for us over the next number of years because we have $1.8 billion of floating rate debt that's going to come down. And as we refinance things, we'll have some amount of increase in our interest expense on the \"fixed rate side. But we just feel -- we feel good about the long-term perspective. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Upal Rana from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Upal Rana : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Could you give us some color on the sublease market across your markets? I know you talked about San Francisco already, but what about the others? And then do you have a sense of what percentage of your tenants are currently subleasing their space? Douglas Linde : So, sublease is -- the biggest issue is clearly on the West Coast, and it's most dominated in San Francisco and then in Seattle. After that, it falls off pretty dramatically. We really don't have much in the way of a sublease problem in New York City, certainly not in the markets that we are competing with. In our portfolio, there's probably 2 million to 3 million square feet overall of space that has been sublet that's not on the sublease market. Again, we've had these transactions like I just described in Westin where Biogen sublet their space for a long time. And two quarters ago, we had the Riverbend space. So we have some sort of chunkier pieces like that. We have one of those in Reston, Virginia with the College Board. So I'd say it's sort of at that level, but we're not competing with our own tenants relative to transactions in our buildings because most of it was done a long time ago. And in the short term, there's been very little in the way of new sublet space that's been brought on in our portfolio per se. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Peter Abramowitz from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Peter Abramowitz : Yes. Thank you for taking my question. So you talked about the survey for CEOs. I think that something like 83% or 85% see their people coming back five days a week over the next couple of years. I guess just could you sort of square that with what you're seeing real-time sort of on-the-ground conversations? I know some of the tech tenants have been calling their folks back to the office five days a week. And you gave some helpful anecdotes there on the West Coast. But just kind of curious with how we square survey results like that with the reality of what your conversations are yielding. Douglas Linde : Sure. So the way you need to think about this is when you say someone is coming back to the office five days a week, they are never in the office five days a week, right? So in 2019, in the best building that we had in our portfolio, if 80% of the seats that were \"in the building were being used on a given day, that would have been nirvana\". And so what we are seeing is that in New York City, we are basically at that level. In Greater Boston and even in Washington, D.C. now, where we have measurements return styles, we are sort of at the sort of 85% to 90% of that level. However, on the West Coast, in San Francisco, we are still sort of at a 65% of that level. And so that's the sort of -- that's what the buildings are telling us. They're also telling us that in all of the markets, the people that are coming in are coming in three-plus days a week. So individual card swipe by a human being that we can identify in general, when you are doing -- coming in, you're coming in very frequently. And so I think it's just a question of building the number of those people who are coming in more frequently that is going to sort of be the thing that creates more \"activity\" in these buildings. Owen Thomas : Yes. And just to add to Doug's data, and I've mentioned this a few times on prior calls. First of all, CEOs are very -- they're not positive about remote work. They want employees back in the office. They have been reluctant to do so for competitive purposes. Remote work is a benefit that many employees want, but it has a real cost. It's like compensation and other benefits you provide employees. And I think it's notable that groups like Amazon and Salesforce and particularly all the start-up AI companies are saying, you know what, this is a benefit that we're no longer able to provide. We need you to come back. And I think those companies taking those actions will allow their competitors to take similar actions because they're all competing for talent. So I'm not surprised by the survey. It's what we hear from our CEO clients. And I think slowly over time, this issue will continue to dissipate and important. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Dylan Burzinski from Green Street. Please go ahead. Dylan Burzinski : Good morning guys and thanks for taking the question. Doug or maybe it was Owen, you talked about tech touring activity picking up in New York. Can you kind of compare that acceleration or pickup in tech tenant touring activity to some of your West Coast gateway markets, excluding any of the AI tenants that are in the market? I guess, what I'm trying to get at is, are you seeing that New York even lead on the tech touring activity front as well? Douglas Linde : So I will let Hilary talk about the tech in New York, and I'll let Rod talk about the tech demand in San Francisco, and you can make your own conclusion. Hilary Spann : Hi, Dylan, this is Hilary. The tech demand, I would say, really started to perk up a little bit after Labor Day. And I think it was pretty close to coincident with the timing of the interest rate cut. And it just seems like businesses across the board are having an easier time making planning decisions at this point. That having been said, to Doug's point earlier, it is taking people an exceptionally long time to actually get through the process of making a decision about what space they want to take. So OpenAI recently committed to space in the market at the Puck building. There are other tech tenants that are touring in the marketplace, but I think it's too early to say that there is a solid trend toward them increasing the amount of space they're taking. Certainly, as we've been talking to executives amongst tech companies, they're more constructive on back to office and therefore, the amount of space they need. But I think we're still in the process of sorting out what that means for the actual amount of space that's going to be taken in the market, particularly in Midtown South. Rodney Diehl : I would just add on the West Coast that I think in addition to the headlines coming out of the AI companies, which has been great, there's definitely a broader base of other technology companies, particularly down in the valley. And I would just make one note of the autonomous vehicle industry. There's a handful of tenants that we're talking to down there that are -- some of them are already our clients, but there's others. And so it's not just AI, definitely. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley. please go ahead. Ronald Kamdem : Hey, guys. Thanks for the time this morning. Just quickly, looking at the health of the New York market overall and the quarter-over-quarter decline in occupancy, can you guys just speak to how much of that was baked into your expectations into the quarter? And looking forward, do you expect a rebound in the fourth quarter? Or are there any headwinds that facing the Manhattan office market that maybe were not as well appreciated by the market? Thanks. Douglas Linde : I hope that we've been pretty clear that we were going to lose O'Melveny & Myers at Times Square Tower in the third quarter, and that's entirely the only major change in our occupancy in Manhattan. And I would say, in fact, our other leasing activity in Manhattan is above expectation. Now many of those leases haven't commenced yet. So they haven't rolled into occupancy. But our buildings in Manhattan, 360 Park Avenue South aside are seeing a significant amount of interest. And we have active dialogue at buildings like Times Square Tower, at buildings like 200 Fifth Avenue, a lot of activity at 599 Lex. And so it's -- we feel really good about the overall level of sort of transactional demand that is possible for 2024 and 2025 in our Midtown and hopefully, our Park Avenue South/Midtown South market as well. Operator : Thank you. And I show our last question in the queue comes from the line of Brendan Lynch from Barclays. Please go ahead. Brendan Lynch : Great. Thank you for taking my question. It sounds like you're potentially interested in acquiring more residential and you have some residential projects beginning the entitlement process. Just wondering if you could give us some color on what the playbook is there? Owen Thomas : Yes. So all of what you said is true. We have -- we own today pushing 2,000 units, and we have several projects on land we control that we're pushing forward with. And as Doug described in his remarks, we're looking at some other sites that were -- we thought in a prior market might be well suited for office, and we think that they can potentially be re-entitled to residential. Our playbook in residential is going to be different from what we do with office and life science. Skymark is a good example of this at Reston Town Center. We own the site. We entitled the site. We did all the development work. We're supervising the construction. We have an 80% capital partner, and we also don't lease and manage the properties. So I think what you should expect from our residential business is less long-term hold and more generation of fees, generation of profits on a minority LP interest and generation of carried interest as opposed to long-term hold. Douglas Linde : Yes. And I would just add the following about our land inventory. And again, I said this in my prepared remarks, we have a significant amount of land inventory where we are carrying that both from an operating perspective as well as a cost of capital perspective. And we are not going to sit around and just wait for the markets to recover. And so we are actively looking at how we can put those resources to use in an accretive way. And it's both multifamily units where we will likely be the developer with third-party money, townhouses where we will probably sell the parcels and Owen referred -- described a couple of parcels that are potentially going to get sold. That's what those are. We are also -- we have some sites that might be good for big box use. We have a site that we've been in contact with somebody who wants to do data centers. And so we are looking to try and as effectively and as quickly as possible, create value from this land inventory because it's not anywhere on our balance sheet, and we get no credit for it relative to our share price. And we think there's actually a significant amount of opportunity there that we are going to try and mine over the next couple of years. And you will start to see some of this occurring in the first quarter of 2025 when hopefully we'll be announcing the commencement of this development at 17 Hartwell Avenue in Lexington, which will be the first of these things. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Owen Thomas, Chairman and CEO, for closing remarks. Owen Thomas : Yes. We have no more formal remarks. Thanks to all of you for your interest in BXP. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Good morning and happy Lunar New Year to all of you. Our results in the fourth quarter demonstrated strong performance given our execution and the property and capital market recovery that is underway. Our FFO per share was in line with our forecast and market consensus for the fourth quarter. We completed over 2.3 million square feet of leasing in the quarter, which was the most quarterly leasing we have experienced since the second quarter of 2019. It was 130% of our long-term average leasing for the fourth quarter and our fifth largest quarter of leasing ever. Over the last few months, we have made several significant leasing announcements with important clients such as Bain Capital, Ropes & Gray, McDermott Will & Emery, and KnitWell. We leased over 5.6 million square feet for all of 2024, which was 35% greater than 2023, and the average term for over 291 leases completed in 2024 was just under 10 years. Though the fourth quarter is usually our most productive leasing quarter due to year end seasonality effects, momentum is clearly building in the market and our leasing results. As I discussed at some length last quarter, the most important market forces impacting BXP, corporate earnings growth, return to office behavior and outperformance of premier workplaces continues to work in our favor, serving as a tailwind for BXP's performance. The one critical factor with a more uncertain trajectory is interest rates. Inflation measured at CPI has risen the last three months to 2.9%, stubbornly above the Fed's 2% target and the December employment release indicated new job creation was well in excess of market expectations. As a result, the Fed has become more cautious lowering its forecast of Fed's fund rate cuts in 2025. And in the fixed income markets, long-term interest rates are up nearly 100 basis points since the Fed's first rate cut in September last year. Notwithstanding these uncertainties, short-term interest rates should remain lower in 2025 than 2024, which would be a positive for our and our clients' cost of capital. One question we frequently receive is to project the impact of the new federal administration's policies on BXP's activities. Though, we are in the early stages of the new administration executing its plan, we do believe many of the articulated policies are business-friendly, particularly lower taxes and less regulation, which will be positive for our clients, building their confidence, and as a result, stimulating leasing activity. Regarding efficiency initiatives, even if the federal workforce is rationalized and the GSA reduces space requirements, having federal workers returning to their offices should be a significant positive for BXP's business in the Washington, D.C. region. BXP has limited exposure to GSA leases and is therefore not directly impacted by a reduction in GSA space requirements. More street life would be a positive for the urban environment and local retailers in Washington, D.C. And many of our users are government contractors who would be more likely to return to their offices in line with their government clients. An area of concern with the new administration's policies, the potential impact to interest rates, given that new tariffs that's implemented could be inflationary, and larger fiscal deficits resulting from tax cuts could lead to higher long-term treasury yields in the debt markets. We are shocked by the devastation of the recent fires in L.A. and empathetic to all those impacted. It is too early to fully understand the future impact of this tragedy on the L.A. office market. But we are aware of a significant office sale process that is progressing with no apparent pricing impact post the fire incident. As discussed repeatedly in the past, BXP competes primarily in the premier workplace segment of the office sector which continues to materially outperform the broader office market. Premier workplaces are defined in CBRE's research as the highest quality 7% of buildings representing 13% of total space in our five CBD markets. Direct vacancy for premier workplaces is currently 13.2% versus 18.8% for the broader market. Likewise, net absorption for premier workplaces has been a positive 8.8 million square feet over the last three years versus a negative 15.6 million square feet for the broader market. Asking rents for premier workplaces are more than 50% higher than the broader market, up from approximately a 40% premium three years ago. Regarding the real estate private equity capital markets, office sales volume in the fourth quarter demonstrated a continued acceleration of deal activity. Specifically, significant U.S. office sales volume was $15.3 billion, 80% greater than the third quarter of \u201824 and 59% above the fourth quarter a year ago. Lower short term interest rates, increased leasing activity for certain assets and locations and better access to debt financing continue to be the drivers. So there were limited premier workplace sale transactions this past quarter in our core markets. Notable deals include Norges purchased the 50% interest that did not already own and a portfolio of eight assets located in Boston, Washington, D. C. And San Francisco from NBIM. Pricing was on average approximately $500 a square foot for a portfolio that is 88.5% lease. A non-US investor purchased a 11% minority interest in One Vanderbilt next to Grand Central in New York City for $2,700 a square foot and a 4.3% reported cap rate. Moving to BXP's capital allocation activities and new investments, we commenced an exciting new office development in Washington, D.C. Specifically, we acquired 725 12th Street, a vacant office building from its lender for $34 million or $112 a square foot. The site is very well-located, immediately adjacent to Metro Center, Washington, D.C.'s busiest transit stop where four train lines converge. Concurrent with the acquisition, we secured a long-term pre-lease commitment from McDermott Will & Emery for 152,000 square feet to anchor a new premier workplace development on the site. Further, we have a letter of intent with another anchor client to lease substantially all of the remaining space. Our development plan is to demolish the existing building, reuse the below grade parking structure, and rebuild a new 320,000 square foot premier workplace with market leading amenities and unique entry meeting and outdoor spaces for our two anchor clients. We expect the full development budget including land acquisition and capital costs will be approximately $350 million and our projected initial cash development yield for the project is over 8%. The development has commenced with our acquisition in December and we expect to deliver the building in late 2028. 725 12th Street is a great example of how BXP is uniquely able to create an accretive investment opportunity in the current market environment. The existing building was empty and its loan in default creating a discounted acquisition opportunity. Industry leading clients want and will pay for new premier workplace space fulfillments notwithstanding high levels of vacancy in existing buildings and BXP has the unique ability to execute given our relationships with lenders and owners, trusted reputation and experience with industry leading clients both in Washington DC and around the US, access to the capital markets needed to fund the development and a market leading execution team to design and construct the new building. Well done team BXP DC. Continuing with new development I described last quarter our 940,000 square foot 343 Madison project in Midtown with direct lobby escalator access to Grand Central Madison Concourse and located two blocks south of JP Morgan's new headquarters building. We are in active conversations with several potential anchor clients ranging from 150,000 to 400,000 square feet. 343 Madison is the only immediately actionable office development site in close proximity to Grand Central Terminal, widely viewed as the most in-demand office sub-market in the U.S. We expect to launch this $2 billion project in 2025, where, as a reminder, BXP owns a 55% interest. We also expect to launch two new residential developments in 2025, where BXP will serve as a developer and a minority owner of the project. One of these projects is in suburban Boston at 17 Hartwell Avenue in Lexington on a site we already own that is being re-entitled, and the other project is in the New York region. More details will be forthcoming when we launch these projects later this year. BXP, along with three partners, was also awarded by the State of New York a project known as Site K, located at 11th Avenue between 35th and 36th Streets, directly across from the Javits Convention Center and adjacent to our 3 Hudson Boulevard commercial site in New York City. The plan is to build approximately 1,350 residential units with an affordable component and a 450-room hotel and two separate towers over a five-story podium. We are very pleased and honored to have been selected by New York State in this highly competitive RFP process. The project is several years away from construction commencement, given the entitlement, pre-development and design work that needs to be completed. BXP also delivered into service two projects this past quarter ahead of schedule. In October, we completed 300 Binney Street, a 240,000-square-foot office-to-lab conversion project fully leased to the Broad Institute on a long-term basis, where we were able to achieve a first-year cash development yield on incremental capital of 14.5%. We also fully delivered into service Skymark; a 508-unit luxury residential high-rise development located Reston Town Center. The lease-up of this project is well ahead of schedule, having leased over 50% of the units at above pro forma rents only six months after opening. We are in active negotiations for the disposition of three land sites and are preparing to put into the market an operating property. In the aggregate, these sales, if successful, will generate approximately $200 million of net proceeds, although it is possible one of the land sale closings gets pushed to 2026. We remain active evaluating our non-producing assets, both sites and buildings taken out of service, to generate more monetization activity. Notwithstanding the development deliveries we completed in the second half of 2024, BXP continues to execute a significant development pipeline with seven office lab, retail, and residential projects underway as of the end of the fourth quarter. The largest of which is 290 Binney and Cambridge fully leased to AstraZeneca and expected to deliver in the second quarter of 2026. These projects aggregate approximately 2.3 million square feet and $2.1 billion of BXP investment with $1.2 billion remaining to be funded. So in conclusion BXP is clearly gaining momentum in both leasing and new investment activity due to more favorable market conditions and our strategy of commitment to both our clients and the premier workplace segment of the office industry, our access to public and private debt and equity capital markets and a leading market presence in our core cities. We will build on this momentum and the constructive environment for our business to lay the foundations for additional growth in the years ahead. Let me turn over our report to Doug. Doug Linde : Thanks Owen. Good morning, everybody. So as Owen said BXP's regional leasing teams had an outstanding fourth quarter and we greatly exceeded our 2024 baseline leasing expectation of three 3.5 million square feet. We did a significant amount of future year expiration leasing during the fourth quarter which followed a pattern that we set over the last 12 months. This has had the effect of dramatically reducing our 2026 and 2027 expirations. During the last 15 months, our 2026 expirations were cut by more than 1.5 million square feet. So as of 12/31/24, 2026 expirations sit at 1.86 million square feet, 3.8% of our portfolio and 2027 sits at 2.2 million square feet, 4.4% of the portfolio and the largest expiration we have in 2026 is 134,000 square feet and the largest expiration we have in 2027 is 143,000 square feet. We are today in renewal or replacement client discussions on more than 500,000 square feet of the 2026 expiration. \u201826 and \u201827 will be exceptionally low rollover years for BXP. Why am I emphasizing this? Because if we continue to lease two to three million square feet of vacancy and expiring space in \u201826 and \u201827, there will be a material improvement in our occupancy. 490,000 square feet is 100 basis points. Mike thought I should just stop right there today, but I'm going to keep going. Our in-service properties finished the year at 87.5% occupancy. A 50 basis point increase from last quarter and slightly ahead of the estimate we provided on our last call. Remember, our occupancy reflects the square footage of space where we are recognizing GAAP revenue. Our leased square footage includes the addition of any spaces that have been leased but have yet to commence GAAP revenue. At the end of the fourth quarter, we were 89.4% leased. Our focus is on leased square footage since it captures all of our future revenue and eliminates the variability of the timing of completion of tenant improvements which governs GAAP revenue recognition and occupancy. We start \u201825 with our leased square footage as I said at 89.4%. We've just completed our bottom-up leasing projections which emanate from the regions. A little help from me as well. And the goal for our in-service and 2025 development deliveries is just over 4 million square feet. So that's our goal for \u201825. In \u201824, we completed leasing on about 1.5 million square feet of vacant space. Our \u201825 estimate includes the execution of about 2 million square feet of currently vacant space and 1.3 million square feet of leasing on known \u201825 move outs and 2025 explorations where we would believe we will be successfully renewing our clients. The remainder of the leasing will be on future year explorations, the 500,000 square feet I talked about earlier. Our current pool of leases in negotiation is about 1 million square feet. It covers 280,000 square feet of currently vacant space, 325,000 square feet of \u201825 explorations, 75,000 square feet of \u201825 renewals with the remaining transactions involving spaces with explorations after \u201825 and as Owen said our second lease at 725 12th Street. There's another 1.6 million square feet of active pipeline transactions which include 550,000 square feet of vacant space. These are deals that are not in LOI states but where we have good clarity. We're off to a good start in \u201825. So, we have 3.1 million square feet of contractual expirations in \u201825. If we achieve our budget of 2.3 million square feet of leasing of vacant and \u201825 expiring space square footage, our net lease pickup would be about 40 basis points. The one adjustment to this number will be the impacts from changes to the portfolio, which will cause some quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, but will even out by the end of 2025. Right now, we expect to take about 825,000 square feet of space out of service, which is currently 62% leased, and we're adding our three developments, 651 Gateway, Reston Block B, and 360 Park Avenue South, which will all be in the in-service portfolio by the end of the year, and they are currently 23% leased. I guarantee they'll be a lot higher before we get to the end of the year, though. In 2025, we're taking a few suburban office assets out of service. This follows the path we took in 2024. We are taking action where we have higher and better use for our assets. There's pent-up demand for residential development and acknowledgement by local governments that affordable housing is a critical component to a successful economy and development economics that can actually work for six-frame construction today. This is leading to a change in attitude towards the permitting of additional housing in some of our communities. We have been working in many of our markets for more than 25 years and have established constructive relationships in these towns and counties. We are working with the local communities to rezone commercial office to for rent and or for sale housing. 17 Hartwell Avenue, as Owen said, is the first example of this. This is a building in Lexington that we took out of service in 2024 and where we have received the entitlements for a 312-unit project in late December. We expect to be under development in early 2025. We have also entitled the site in Shady Grove, Maryland for townhouses and have executed an agreement to sell the first space to a townhome developer. We've done the same thing in Herndon, Virginia, where we have rezoned land holding two existing office buildings for a 359-unit rental project and a townhouse development and we have already executed an agreement to sell the townhouse development sites. This is what we expect to accomplish with the buildings that we are taking out of service in \u201825. Our office markets have either stabilized or are improving. Sublet additions have tailed off, leasing activity has picked up in every market and the negative absorption spigot appears to have stopped in Boston, San Francisco, Northern Virginia and the District of Columbia already seen in Midtown Manhattan over the last year. Our two largest property concentrations, the Back Bay of Boston and Midtown Manhattan, continue to be the strongest markets in our portfolio. Availability is sparse, rents are increasing and concessions remain constant. While there's no meaningful job growth in office using jobs across the US economy, the pace of job reductions has slowed. There are still technology companies that are reducing headcount but there are others that are short of space and increasing their footprints. We are witnessing space utilization growth in pockets of industries though they vary by market. Take the legal industry as a case in point. There are law firms in New York and Boston that are expanding while at the same time law firms in Washington DC and San Francisco continue to reduce but upgrade their footprints. The improvement in business sentiment, the anticipation of deal activity and a more robust capital raising environment are improving the confidence of our existing and potential customers. When our clients are confident, they are more constructive about making long-term real estate commitments. While we don't think that \u201825 is going to be characterized by a dramatic pickup in market leasing absorption, we are certainly on the right track and our data on premier space illustrates the activity continues to migrate to the best assets. As Owen said, there's no better example of this than the transaction that he described at 725-12. When we began our pursuit of this opportunity, we identified eight buildings to find its class they premiere by the brokerage community in DC, including one new development under construction that could accommodate 150,000 square foot clients. Were they trophy? Did they have availability at the top of the building? Were they amenity rich? Well, none of these buildings were deemed to be acceptable by our client. In order to bridge the delivery of the new development, the client also executed a short term extension at 500 North Capitol, a JV asset owned by BXP rather than relocate when their existing lease expired to the existing inventory in the market. The bifurcation is real. BXP's activity for the fourth quarter was not dominated by any region. We completed 680,000 square feet in Boston, 577 in New York, 571 on the West Coast and 494,000 square feet in DC. 320,000 square feet was on currently vacant space, 626,000 involved \u201824 and \u201825 expirations and 1.2 million involved lease extensions for the space that we were scheduled to expire post-2026. 152,000 square feet was for the new development at 725-12. The activity includes about 312,000 square feet of leasing on existing vacant space. Across the portfolio, the deals were executed this quarter had a markdown of about 5% with a 3% increase in Boston, a 5% decrease in New York, a 10% decrease in D.C., and a 14% decrease on the West Coast. Pretty consistent with what you saw in our supplemental for the leases that hit revenue this quarter. The bifurcation of client demand between the East Coast and the West Coast continues to exist, and there are actions of the clients in these respective markets that are also different. There is little large block availability in the Back Bay of Boston or in the Park Avenue sub market in New York. The lease extensions we completed with Ropes & Gray at the Prudential Center this quarter begins in 2031. You may recall that we did an early extension with Bain Capital earlier this year and another with MFS at 111 Huntington Avenue in \u201823. At the moment, the rents necessary to justify new construction in Boston are considerably higher than the rents embedded in extensions. Our large clients recognize that if they want to remain in the Back Bay long term, there are few alternatives to remaining in place. This quarter, we did two other larger renewals in Boston, one at 200 Clarendon and the other at Atlantic Wharf. These clients had the options to go to vacant space and the greater CBD market, but that would have meant significant changes in quality and location. Our Boston CBD portfolio availability is as tight as it has ever been. We do have some work to do, however, in our urban edge portfolio, which is where we have our largest concentration of vacant space, large known expirations and life science availability. These markets are focused on traditional technology and life science clients, life science tenant clients, and that demand growth continues to be weak. Traditional life science demand is weaker than office demand. We are in discussions with a few life science companies that are looking exclusively for office space as they focus their capital on acquiring de-risked products that are in trials rather than pure drug discovery and therefore don't need lab infrastructure. There is considerable lab sublease space available and the economics of these offerings make it very difficult for new developments with Shell Lab to compete even if we provide a significant tenant improvement allowance. Our availability in Midtown Manhattan is almost none but we have a concentration in Midtown South. We have 350,000 square feet of availability at 205th Avenue where we are in lease negotiations with a non-technology client for 244,000 square feet. At 360 Park Avenue South, demand is picking up and there has been some improvement in small tech tenant inquiry but overall tech demand in \u201825 is still less than 40% of what it was pre-COVID. We are in lease with another single floor tenant at 360 Park Avenue South. During the quarter, we leased about 200,000 square feet to financial firms in the Park Avenue submarket at the General Motors Building, 599 Lex and at 510 Madison Avenue. Each of these clients experience growth in their footprint. There is no question that the activity we have seen at 599 Lex is a direct result of the lack of availability on Park Avenue. Our largest Midtown opportunity in \u201825 is at 510 Madison. We are finishing it up in a many upgrade and have about 100,000 square feet of availability on 11,500 square foot floors. The big news is that the small floor leasing market this quarter was made by CBRE who took multiple small floors at Lever House earlier this month at rents that position our offering at 510 Madison as a great value in the market. There is a sparse selection of large block space availability in the Park Avenue area, which pretends well for our ability, as Owen said, to get a commitment at 343 Madison, where the rents necessary to support new construction are only a slight premium to current market rents, and we're leasing at rents that will be starting in 2029 and 2030. The leasing excitement on the West Coast in \u201824 continues to be growth from AI organizations in the city of San Francisco. At this point, we're not sure what defines an AI company, since it seems that even established technology companies are describing their proprietary large-language model computing power and storage of data, and there are a number of organizations that are working on industry-specific solutions that rely on new training models. The critical point is that the technology ecosystem in the city of San Francisco and the peninsula is where the bulk of these businesses are operating and growing. In addition, the cost of office real estate is significantly cheaper, the cost of housing is cheaper, and there is more available talent, and there has been in the last decade in the Bay Area. Our largest availability in our CBD portfolio wide is in San Francisco. Many of our traditional office users have continued to rationalize their space in the city, which has led to little, if any, growth in the traditional San Francisco CBD market. Mayor Lurie is just weeks into his new job, and one of his priorities is bringing workers and shoppers and visitors back to the CBD. View spaces in short supply, but spacing the lower sections of buildings is widely available and very competitive. We completed a new amenity center and a market area center in December, and are now focused on increasing occupancy there and at 680 Folsom Street, where we also have a large block and are finishing up a new amenity offering as well. Before I hand the call over to Mike to discuss \u201825 earnings guidance, I want to reiterate my comments at the top of my remarks. We accomplished a lot of leasing and a lot of early in the rules in \u201824. We expect \u201825 will be a year of modest lease square footage increases as we focus on leasing vacant space and known expirations. When we get to \u201826 and \u201827, there is going to be very little expiration headwinds. If we lease at a pace anything like \u201824 and what we hope to accomplish in \u201825, we will see our lease percentage accelerate. Mike, time to talk about the quarter and guidance for \u201825. Mike LaBelle : Excellent. Thanks Doug. Good morning, everybody. So this morning I plan to cover the details of our fourth quarter and full year \u201824 performance. And I'm going to spend most of my time describing our \u201825 initial earnings guidance that was included in our press release with additional details in our supplemental financial package. For 2024, we reported total consolidated revenues of $3.4 billion and full year FFO of $1.25 billion or $7.10 per share. We continue to grow our portfolio and saw revenue increase by 4% in 2024, primarily from bringing new developments into service. Our fourth quarter FFO of $1.79 per share was in line with the midpoint of the guidance we provided last quarter, and our portfolio performed consistent with our expectations. As Doug mentioned, our occupancy climbed this quarter by 50 basis points to 87.5%. Our Premier Workplace CBD buildings that contribute nearly 90% of the company's revenues continue to outperform and are 90.9% occupied and 92.8% leased. Our CBD occupancy improved by 80 basis points in the fourth quarter with positive absorption in Boston, New York City, and Seattle. We also recorded 2024 full year AFFO, which we refer to as FAD in our supplemental, of $894 million, which exceeds our dividend payout by over $200 million. While not impacting our FFO, we recorded non-cash impairment charges totaling $341 million this quarter related to three of our unconsolidated joint ventures. The charges all relate to assets located on the West Coast and include our interest in Colorado Center, Gateway Commons, and Safeco Plaza. With that, I will turn to our 2025 guidance. On a high level, our 2025 guidance can be summarized as follows. Growth from a full year of contribution of development deliveries, higher fee income, and relatively flat 2025 same property portfolio of NOI compared to 2024. These items will be offset by lower termination income, lower interest income from utilizing our cash balances to pay off debt and fund our developments, and a loss of NOI from taking buildings out of service for future development. I'll start with the growth from our development activities. In 2024, we delivered two fully leased properties. 300 Benny Street in Cambridge and Dick's House of Sport at the Prudential Center in Boston. We also delivered Skymark, our multifamily project in Reston that is currently in lease up and 54% lease today. As Owen mentioned, it's exceeding our expectations on both absorption pace and rental rates. Our life science deliveries at 651 Gateway in South San Francisco and 103 and 180 CityPoint in Waltham continue to be in lease up with minimal projective contribution to our earnings in 2025. 651 Gateway will be delivered into service and we will cease interest capitalization in the first quarter of 2025. And lastly, our 360 Park Avenue South development in Midtown South opened in late 2024. We have four floors occupied and are seeing a meaningful pickup in leasing activity. We will complete incremental leasing in 2025, but the revenue commencement will likely be either late in the year or in 2026. We expect the NOI for 360 Park will have significant growth in 2026 as we gain occupancy from new leasing. 360 Park will be delivered into service and we will cease interest capitalization in the third quarter of 2025. Overall, the incremental contribution to our NOI from our developments in 2025 is expected to be $19 million to $22 million. Our same property portfolio is the largest contributor to our earnings and generated approximately $1.9 billion of NOI in 2024, including our share of joint ventures. Doug described in detail our lease expirations over the next 12 months and the expectation that we will grow our lease percentage as we execute our leasing plan for 2025. As , there is a lag between signing a lease, achieving occupancy, and generating GAAP revenue. In the first half of 2025, we have several larger expirations that will impact our occupancy. These include 350,000 square feet at 205th, whereas Doug described we're negotiating a replacement lease for occupancy in 2026. We also have 480,000 square feet in two uncovered expirations in suburban Boston. This totals 1.6% of the portfolio and is expected to result in our occupancy declining slightly in the first six months of 2025. We do have signed leases totaling 860,000 square feet that will take occupancy spread relatively evenly across 2025. Our leasing plan results in our occupancy remaining relatively stable and averaging 86.5% to 88% during the year. Our same property NOI is also anticipated to be stable and we project \u201825 same property NOI growth of negative 1% to positive 0.5% from 2024. Our 2025 same property NOI on a cash basis will actually increase by up 1.5% from 2024 as we have free rent burning off that will increase our cash flow from the portfolio. Turning to our fee income which we expect to be higher in 2025 from earning leasing commissions on our joint venture properties this is primarily at 205th and 360 Park Avenue South in New York City and will also generate incremental construction management fees as we construct the tenant improvements for AstraZeneca at 290 Binney Street in Cambridge. Our projection for fee income in 2025 is $32 million to $38 million, an increase of $7 million at the midpoint from 2024. Our termination income was higher than typical in 2024 and totaled $16 million or $0.09 per share. In 2025, we're projecting a more normalized $4 million to $8 million of termination income so this results in a $10 million projected revenue decline in 2025 at the midpoint of our guidance. As we described on our call last quarter, we project our net interest expense will be higher in 2025 as we will be carrying lower cash balances resulting in lower interest income. At yearend, we reported cash balances of $1.3 billion. At the beginning of January, we utilized $850 million of available cash to pay off an expiring senior unsecured note. We are also forecasting approximately $700 million of development spend in 2025. Overall, we project our average cash balance will be $800 million lower on average in 2025 reducing our interest income by approximately $35 million year-over-year. Our consolidated interest expense is expected to be relatively flat in 2025 versus 2024 assuming no Fed rate cuts and with 12% of our debt portfolio floating, we will benefit if the Fed cuts rate this year and that is reflected in the low end of our interest expense guidance. Overall, we project net interest expense of $610 million to $625 million in 2025, an increase of $33 million from 2024 at the midpoint. Lastly, and as I described last quarter, we have taken Reston Corporate Center, the buildings at Reston Corporate Center, out of service upon the expiration of the full building lease on 12/31/24. This is the location for the next phase of our highly successful Reston Town Center development that we anticipate will encompass 2.3 million square feet of new mixed-use development, including both multifamily and commercial space. The ability to increase the density by nearly 10 times on this site will create significant future value and earnings over time. The buildings generated $11 million or $0.06 per share of NOI in 2024 that we will lose in 2025. So, to sum all this up, our initial guidance range for 2025 FFO is $6.77 to $6.95 per share, representing a decline of 2% at the high end from 2024. At the midpoint, the decline is comprised of higher net interest expense of $0.20, lower same property NOI of $0.03, lower termination income of $0.06, higher G&A of $0.04, and the loss of $0.06 from pulling Reston Corporate Center out of service. These are projected to be partially offset by higher NOI from our developments of $0.11 and higher fee income of $0.04. Again the modest decline in 2025 FFO is primarily due to lower interest income from lower cash balances as we fund our development pipeline that will generate future growth, pulling buildings out of service for future development as well as decline in non-core termination income. We have not included any incremental acquisition activity in our guidance, so we are actively looking for opportunities. Looking forward to 2026, we see an opportunity to demonstrate meaningful growth in our portfolio. We have very limited lease expirations and project positive absorption in the in-service portfolio, and we have embedded growth opportunity in the development pipeline through the delivery of a fully leased 290 Binney Street in mid-2026 and the lease-up of the available space in our 2024 and 2025 development deliveries. You can hear about all of this and more at our Triennial Investor Conference we will hold this fall on September 9th in New York City. The conference will be a deep dive into our portfolio and our future outlook and will include presentations from our regional teams offering an opportunity for investors to see the depth of our company. We will send out Save the Dates soon and we look forward to hosting all of you. That completes our formal remarks. Operator, can you open the lines for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] I share our first question. It comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Yes, thanks. Good morning. Doug, you provided a litany of information. I'm not sure that I was able to transcribe it all 100% accurately, but high level, when you sort of look at the rollover this year, just help me think through kind of your retention ratio and given to no move out. So like what you expect to retain of the expiring spaces here and then I guess what is your broad expectations for I\u2019ll call new leasing activity on vacant space. Doug Linde : Okay. I'm going to answer your question circuitously. In a year when we have very large lease expirations, so we have a 350,000 or 400,000 square foot lease expiring, highly unlikely that we've retained that organization. When we have a year when we have the multitude of our leases expiring that are between 40,000 square feet and 5,000 square feet, we're probably retaining a very high percentage of those tenants. So as I look forward into what we have remaining in 2024 that are \u201825 that are known expirations, all of the large ones we've already sort of quote unquote acknowledge are going to be known vacancies. And we are now leasing that space to other customers. So the obvious example that we're going to talk about on the call was 200 Fifth Avenue, we have a 350,000 square foot lease expiring, and we were in negotiation on a 240,000 square foot replacement tenant on that, right? So that's, I think that's sort of the way that works. In a quote unquote non-large lease expiration year, generally we are quote unquote renewing somewhere between 45% and 50% of our existing tenants. Some of those are actually growing so we may actually be picking up additional square footage there, but that's sort of what our quote unquote known retention rate is. If you look at 2025, what we are looking at this year is that we will cover somewhere in the neighborhood of three plus or minus million square feet of vacancy and known leasing expirations of tenants that are expiring plus the renewals of the smaller tenants that are sort of moving forward through the normal process. So we have a whole host of those. So as I describe sort of what we're currently working on today, in the year we're covering some vacant space. We have leases on known expirations and then I said we have about 75,000 square feet of leases in progress on just sort of normal as ordinary sort of ordinary course of business expirations that are occurring on a day-to-day basis in the portfolio. So as I look into \u201826 and \u201827, those numbers are exceedingly low and the bulkiness is also low, right. If I start with 1.8 million square feet today, which is the number in the supplemental on a 100% basis and I have 500,000 square feet that I'm actively working on that I expect to get done in 2025, that means when we get to this point in 2026, my known expirations for \u201826 are going to be under 1.3 million square feet. If I lease on a sort of average year somewhere in the neighborhood of 2 to 3 million square feet of vacant and renewals, I'm picking up occupancy in a meaningful way and that pattern will also move forward into 2027. That was my point of my sort of initial remarks. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Andrew Berger from Bank of America. Andrew Berger : Hey, good morning. This is Andrew. I'm for Jeff. I appreciate all the detail. So Doug, you mentioned that Back Bay Boston and Midtown Manhattan are the strongest markets and obviously it sounds like there's a lot of great activity that's reflected by the volumes. You also mentioned though that concessions are flat and I'm just curious with all this activity, what does it take to really become more aggressive and start to reduce concessions? Doug Linde : So I'm going to give you a quick answer and then I'll ask Hilary and I'll ask Bryan to comment on it. So my quick answer is inflation is real in terms of what happened over the last five years. So the cost of building anything probably went up somewhere between 45% and 55%. So just assume 50%. So the cost for a one of our clients to move into new space or rebuild their space is materially higher. So the contribution that we are giving them on sort of a real basis is it makes up a smaller portion of what they actually have to spend. But Hilary and Bryan, why don't you sort of talk about the stickiness of concessions in your market. Hilary? Hilary Spann : Sure. Yes. Hi, this is Hilary. I would say that in discrete instances in Midtown on the Park Avenue corridor, there are some reductions in concessions, but that is in a very defined geographic area more broadly, even on the margins of the Park Avenue sub-market, there is availability in buildings and folks have choices about where they want to go. And so the concessions are sticky because the availability levels are elevated outside of the Park Avenue sub-market. And so that's part of the reason that I think you've seen the overall statistics reflect sort of a flattening but not radical decline in concessions given in New York. Bryan? Bryan Koop : Yes, I'd say that Doug was spot on with the inflation comment. And then also we are definitely feeling, let's say, some flattening on the concessions regarding TI in the Back Bay. However, our downtown market is not in that position and it can be used in negotiations. But it's definitely firmed on TI. Very noticeable. For Back Bay only, though. Operator : And I share our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey, good morning down there. So question for you guys, you've outlined a pretty solid outlook sort of tail end of this year into \u201826 and \u201827, as far as addressing a lot of leasing exposure. And it sounds like, I know you're not giving guidance for the next few years, but sounds like all else equal, we should see a meaningful pickup at FFO. What are the risks or offsets? Like, for example, acquisitions that maybe dilutive or taking buildings out of service for redevelopment like what would stop you guys from or what would stop FFO from really accelerating tail end of this year into next? Doug Linde : So let me, I\u2019m going to give you half the answer and I'll let Mike give you the other half of the answer. So on my half of the answer, I believe if you look at our NOI from our same property portfolio in our development there will be meaningful increases in the contribution from those quote-unquote assets as we move into 2026 and 2027. Mike LaBelle : So I mean I think on the other side of things there's where interest rates going. So we're a short-term long-term interest rates going what does that mean for our interest expense based as we refinance bonds that are expiring every year and that is offset by what is likely to be somewhat lower floating rates on the 12% to 15% of our debt portfolio that's floating. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Thank you. Doug mentioned life science tenants looking for office space exclusively, and I'm wondering if you could provide any commentary on how widespread you think that is. Either by geography or stage of the companies. And if you believe this is a reflection of AI and its impact on the biotech sector. Doug Linde : Okay, so I'll try to give you a perspective on that, and then I'll let Rod give you a perspective as well. And Bryan, if you have anything else you want to add as well. So what I believe is going on right now is that there is a bunch of money that is being raised in the life science sector that are looking for opportunities to take advantage of trials that have already started and shown some efficacy. And they are instead of, quote unquote, starting with a brand new idea, looking sort of for that later stage, quote unquote, proven kind of a product to move forward. And there are management teams that have been able to figure out how to raise capital to do those things. And they are the companies that we are seeing right now, certainly in suburban Boston, as the preponderance of the, quote unquote, expansion and growth relative to life science. What we have not seen is significant numbers of incubator kinds of companies going to the point where they are now ready to move into a more permanent kind of a space because they have been given capital by their VCs in order to go to the next level in the same way that was happening in \u201818, \u201819 and \u201920, right. That's where all of the demand was coming from. So I'd say there's sort of that shift. And Rod, you may want to comment on what you're seeing in the South San Francisco market. Rodney Diehl : Thanks, Doug. So I think it's important to keep in mind that our office buildings in South San Francisco have always catered to the office component of the life science business that was around down there. And that's still the case. We actively are in negotiations now with a larger lab tenant that's specifically looking for more office space. So that is definitely part of it. I don't know if it's attributable to the AI piece as your question came through, John, but there's a mix of office users that are life science tenants. That's very typical in our market. Doug Linde : Bryan? Bryan Koop : Yes. In Boston, I'd say we've seen a little bit of evidence, let's say three to four situations that are indicative of what Doug and we've discussed here, but not enough to say it's a big trend. And it's only in the urban edge market. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Nick Yulico : Good morning, Mike. I had a question on the occupancy guidance. So the midpoint assumes you're roughly flat from where you ended Q4. But that guidance doesn't include the developments being put into service. So I was hoping you can quantify how much the developments will drag occupancy this year. The reason I'm asking is I think you'll be reporting an in-service occupancy number through the year that actually includes those developments being added in. So it'd be helpful to know that. Thanks. Mike LaBelle : Sure. I'm happy to answer that, Nick. I think in our supplemental, what we provide is what the in-service occupancy is at the end of the year. And then we guide to what we expect the occupancy to be in those buildings for 2025 as a way to help you kind of determine where the same store is going, where the portfolio NOI is going. But you're right in 2024 we had some negative impacts because we brought 103 CityPoint online in the fourth quarter and we brought 180 CityPoint online in the third quarter and that was not part of our original kind of guidance for the in-service portfolio. At the end of the year we're at 87.5% occupied. We're going to remove Reston Corporate Center from service. It's fully leased. It's not a big impact. It's only down about 10 basis points so we'll start it at 87.4% net of that. If you look at the developments that are delivering as I mentioned on my notes 651 Gateways coming in Q1 and then 365 Park and Block D will come in Q3. Right now they're 21% occupied, if they don't achieve any more occupancy, it's going to have a negative impact of 70 basis points roughly on our occupancy. Now, as Doug mentioned, we've got some activity there, especially at 360 Park. So we do think we're going to have a little bit more occupancy there, but they're certainly not going to be fully leased. Doug also mentioned that we're going to remove some other buildings from service in the suburbs. So there's a couple of buildings in suburban Boston we're thinking about and suburban, in Princeton that we're thinking about. And if we were to do that, because we have a higher and best use for those assets to build residential developments, that actually goes the other direction and could help us by close to 90 basis points. So as Doug mentioned, kind of a net of these two things is not going to be that impactful. But at this point, we haven't determined, right, to take those buildings out of service. Doug Linde : Yes, let me just comment on our development pipeline and sort of what's going on in there and where I think you'll start to see some progress and where you won't see some progress. So the building that probably sees the most relative progress during the year in terms of its lease square footage is probably 360 Park Avenue South, knock on wood. However, you can sort of talk about the activity we're seeing there. And then we're actually seeing some leasing activity at 180 CityPoint. Again, it's a lab building where we're talking to lab tenants about office space. And therefore, we're going to likely be building out office space, not lab space. And then we're also not going to be building out a lab infrastructure in that space. So we're not going to be spending the same capital. And then Jake, you may want to comment on sort of what we're also doing and seeing at Reston Block B. So in all three of those particular situations, I believe you will see a meaningful increase in occupancy during 2000, sorry, lease percentage in 2025. The occupancy won't hit until 2026. Where we're going to have, I'd say a more of a challenge are at 651 Gateway, which is the building we have with ARE where there's very little activity right now. And then at 103 CityPoint, which is the second lab building that we have in the Waltham Submarket. But Jake, why don't we start with you and talk about Block D, and then Hilary can talk about 360 Park Avenue South, and Bryan can talk about 180 CityPoint. Jake Stroman : Yes, sure, thanks Doug. I will just say that we've seen a pretty meaningful uptick in activity across the Reston Town Center Market, and in particular the 75,000 square foot Block D development that we just delivered. And we have a few clients and proposals and prospects that we're discussing, taking the majority or all the space with. So very good activity, and hope to have better news to deliver here in the coming quarter or two. Doug Linde : Hilary? Hilary Spann : Thanks Doug. At 360 Park Avenue South, as Doug mentioned earlier, we have one lease out for a full floor at that building. So that will be the fifth floor that we've leased there. And we have three or four other proposals that we're actively trading that are roughly the same size, one floor to two floors. That's really where the demand sweet spot seems to be in that sub-market. And as a reminder, the floor plates there are about 23,000 square feet. So call it 20,000 to 40,000 square foot tenants. The larger tenant demand has remained muted in Midtown South. And so if we continue to see 20 to 40s, we expect that we'll have very good leasing activity throughout the course of the year and that the building will continue to lease up a pace. But there is still the outside chance that we'll get a larger tenant; in which case I think that it could fill up quite quickly. So we'll just have to see how it plays out with regards to the tenant size demand. But we are in active discussions with several tenants and out to lease with one in particular for a full floor. Doug Linde : Bryan? Bryan Koop : 180 CityPoint has noted probably the highest probability of getting some lease up there. And we started seeing some pickup in the fourth quarter. And I'd say that they were from clients that had been in the market for over a year and really gain confidence in the fourth quarter that we're seeing. So that building is excellent. It's the best product in the market for life science and the description that we have about a couple deals looking at it for life science but office is hopeful. 103, a little bit more challenging, it's GMP building and that zone is a little bit more quiet although we're still optimistic about that for a possible lease this year. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith from UBS. Michael Goldsmith : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Doug, in the past you commented that 3 million square feet of leasing equates to flat occupancy. You talked a lot about if they've done a nice job of cutting back on some of the future exploration. So is there a nice, hard and fast rule, how we should think about going forward, or is it still 3 million equates to flat occupancy from here? Thanks. Doug Linde : Yes, so in 2025, 3 million is flat occupancy. 3 million in 2026 is a meaningful increase in occupancy. Again, our portfolio is 49 million square feet. So 490,000 square feet is 100 basis points. So if we have under 2 million square feet expiring and we do 3 million square feet of leasing on vacant and expirations, that would mean a pickup of a material amount. I'm doing the math for you. I'm not suggesting I'm giving you a projection for \u201826. Operator : And I show a next question comes from the line of Floris Van Dijkum from Compass Point LLC. Floris Dijkum : Hey, thanks, guys, for taking my question. Question on capital allocation. Owen as you think about where you're deploying your capital, obviously the transaction in DC at 725-12 was very interesting. How do you think about -- how many other types of transactions like that are in the markets? What kind of -- what markets are you looking at? Or which markets you think are going to be the most active for you in \u201825 and maybe also touch on the sellers or who you're getting this product from, if you could. Owen Thomas : Yes. Okay, Floris, so I would break it first between development and acquisitions. So on development, the only market where development is really supported by current market rents is in Midtown, New York. And so we have, as I mentioned in my remarks, and you're aware of 343, Madison, which we have, which we expect to launch this year. We are speaking to several anchor clients for that. And given the yield that we project, we think it's a very appropriate and strong allocation capital decision for the firm. Also in DC, as I mentioned in my remarks, I think our team did a magnificent job of creating a very accretive new development opportunity, given the dynamics in DC. There\u2019re clients that want to be in premier space, number one. Number two, they were able to identify a building where the loan was in default and buy the loan at an interesting price. So we got a good land basis and all the math worked and they were able to de-risk the project from a leasing standpoint, given all of their relationships in the market and the interest by clients there in premier workplaces. We also have a great site in the Back Bay of Boston. Right now, I don't think market rents support that development, but it's getting closer because again, as Doug said, the Back Bay of Boston and Midtown New York are the two strongest markets we're in. And my expectation is that's probably the next site that we control that will pencil from an office standpoint. And then just to finish the remarks on development, if other teams in other regions can replicate what our DC team did with the clients in the buildings that they created, we're going to want to do that. So that's the development answer. And then on the acquisitions answer, we continue to be in the market looking for buildings that are either currently premier workplaces or ones that we can make into premier workplaces. And again, we have looked at a lot of different deals and we continue to be out in the market. And as Mike said, he didn't put anything in his projections for next year about new acquisitions, but we're hoping that we're going to, this cycle, we're going to be able to identify accretive acquisition. That's certainly been our history. Anytime there's a down tick in real estate and specifically office real estate, BXP has been able to add great properties at accretive yield to its portfolio. And I fully expect that to happen again, this cycle. But there's nothing right now that's specific that we could point to that, I think we will get done in the near term. But that doesn't mean later in the year something that's of interest won't present itself. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Griffin from Citi. Michael Griffin : Great. Doug, maybe going back to your assumptions around vacancy leasing for the year. As I look in the portfolio, kind of stands out from a vacancy perspective as still San Francisco. So, suffice it to say, do you really need to see demand accelerate in that market for vacant space and thinking about, 680 Folsom, 535 Mission, as two examples of high quality properties there that could see some leasing. Or do you have enough demand from your portfolios in New York, Boston, DC to be able to hit that vacancy leasing goal? Thanks. Doug Linde : Sure. So I'm going to let Rod talk about what's going on in San Francisco and sort of what our expectations are there. But we need all of our markets to perform from an increase in available space being leased to new clients, right? That's the mandate across the entire portfolio. And everybody has to, all the reasons have to pull their part. Obviously, we have lower expectations and higher expectations, depending upon the particular property, as well as the particular sort of environment of what the demand might be for that. In San Francisco, we've done a really good job, actually, of leasing available space at 535 Mission, because of, interestingly, the sort of demand that it is apt to capture end and the success that building has had in grabbing that demand. We need to do more of that. We also need to do more leasing at a market-era center, and we need to do more leasing at 680 Folsom. And Rod can talk about some of the things that we are doing to accelerate our activity in those properties. Rod? Rodney Diehl : Yes. Well, you hit on 535, which has had really great leasing experience in \u201824, and we've got a good pipeline of deals we're talking to there still. And our strategy, both at 535 and in Embarcadero and at 680 Folsom, is centered around an amenity-based offering first in a premier workplace environment. So we just finished this fantastic amenity center in Embarcadero center called The Mosaic. It's gotten great reviews, and it's a super great draw for bringing new clients in. It's something that not every other building is offering. I certainly don't think at the quality. So we're doing that at Embarcadero. We have a similar type of focused amenity offering under construction now at 680 Folsom. We've done some remodeling to the lobby, and we're going to add another portion on the ground floor, which will be a tenant amenity. So that's going to definitely get some traction. We're also going to enhance the roof deck. We have a capital plan in place that's going to be completed this year on the roof deck of 680 Folsom, which, again, is going to be a nice way to differentiate that building. So I think we're positioning all these buildings for success. We have a great spec suite program in all the buildings that we've used over the years, and it's when you go down a list of deals that we did last year, many of them are in those spec suites. So it's not the only focus, but it's certainly an important focus, and we're going to keep doing that. And I'll just close on the point that San Francisco had positive net absorption for the fourth quarter. That hasn't happened in a long time, so it's a good sign, and we feel it in our activity, and so we're optimistic we're at it, and we're going to have a good year. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Richard Anderson from Wedbush Securities. Richard Anderson : Thanks. Good morning. So at the outset, you talked about your lack of exposure to the GSA leasing business, but perhaps defense contractors follow the Trump five-day RTO approach to government workers. Then you have Amazon, JP Morgan, Salesforce. I'm wondering how critical this is into your old leasing outlook for \u201826 and \u201827 in terms of return to office. Is it enough to be two or three days a week for you to have a successful negotiating platform, or do you need that to kind of ramp to a full week eventually over the course of the next few years, and whether or not you can comment on the conversations you're having with your tenants about what their plans are for return to office over the next few years? Thanks. Doug Linde : Yes. The return to office is clearly accelerating, and it's helping our leasing activity. I think it's varied a bit by industry, and therefore we see it a little bit differently by region, because different industries have different concentrations in different regions. So it's a big plus. Look, we have always said return to office is important to leasing. But also corporate earnings growth as a proxy for corporate health is actually even more important. And that's also a positive. So I would put both of those in the same category when you think about the health of the client base that we serve. In terms of number of days in the week, I mean, look, I think even for clients that are only coming in two or three days a week, they want everybody in the office on the same days because that's why they're there is to collaborate. So it's hard to save space. People aren't allocating, okay, you come in Monday, Tuesday, and this group comes in Thursday, Friday. So I don't think necessarily going from four days to five days increases space demand under that logic. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck from Wells Fargo. Blaine Heck : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Related to the earlier question on concessions and increasing costs, I'm wondering whether you've noticed a change in tenants' willingness to move and upgrade their space, given the higher costs to move and higher costs to build out their space over and above what you've given them in TIs, and whether that's driven more of a preference to renew in place because of those cost pressures, maybe even slowing the flight to quality. And if so, how does that factor into your leasing strategy? Doug Linde : Yes, so I'm going to give you a response on that, and then I'll let the region's going to sort of chime in. My sense from what I have been seeing is that most of our clients have said, we have to rebuild our space because we have to be competitive with our offering to our employees. And interestingly, if you have older space, call it 10-plus-year-old space, the brain damage associated with staying in place and renovating it is not something that is very attractive to many of our clients. And unless they are forced to do that, they would prefer to move. In many cases, they would prefer to move within our buildings if we had space available to them. But in many cases, we can't do that. And so they are going ahead and spending the money. And right now, again, and as Owen sort of talked about earlier, the confidence that our clients have based upon the economy is giving them, I'd say, the conviction that it's a good time to be making that capital allocation to their space. So, maybe Hilary and Rod, you can start. And then Bryan talked about sort of the CBD location and then perhaps Jake, you talk about what's going on in Reston. Rod? Hilary Spann : This is Hilary. I would entirely agree with the comment around the difficulty regarding renovating in place. We've seen clients be very reluctant to do that. I think that there is a lot of confidence in the New York market around the direction of the economy, and for the client base in BXP's New York portfolio around their business models and their future, and so what we are seeing a lot of is clients expanding in our buildings, taking new space and building that space out. We're also seeing new demand coming into the portfolio, and of course that tendency is generally always a full new build. So I think it's much more of a case where the demand drivers are expansion of the economy and expansion of the business units, and they want fresh new space that will help them compete for employees and will help them compete for clientele. So that's the trend that I see in New York. Doug Linde : Rod? Rodney Diehl : I would just add that I think what we are not seeing is the short-term renewals that we saw early in emerging out of the pandemic. Most of our clients are confident in what the future looks like and are not asking for short-term renewals. I mean, I think in those cases, it's tough. If somebody is willing to just do a one- or two-year extension or three-year even, then it's hard to pull a tenant like that out of a building, but most of the people we're talking to are willing to make long-term commitments 10-plus years. So I think that they're doing exactly what you said, Doug, which is they're looking to build a better offering for their employees to come back and entice them back. And we're seeing that across all of our existing tenants and then the ones that we're trying to pull out of other buildings, definitely. Doug Linde : And, Jake, comment on sort of the opportunities that the two tenants that we're talking to about Reston next have to stay where they want, where they are, and what they're doing. Jake Stroman : Yes, sure. I mean, again, we are having very interesting and productive conversations with lots of clients in the Northern Virginia market. Over half of our holdings in the D.C. region are in Reston Town Center, which is what I would say is the home to the who's who of the defense and cybersecurity community. And these are groups that can pay market-leading rents and are seeking trophy quality product in a mixed-use environment. And a lot of that is just because they want to attract and retain and motivate their employee base. So we're seeing lots of inbounds in that regard, and so it's exciting for the future of Reston Town Center. Doug Linde : But, again, just to sort of keep going on this, Jake, the two tenets that we're actually talking to you about Reston Next, have the ability to stay where they are and pay rent that is significantly lower than what we're charging at Block B, correct? Jake Stroman : Absolutely. And in each case, the landlords would happily accept renewals with these clients. But these clients want change. They want to motivate their employees to continue to come to work and do the important work that they do to generate revenue forms. So they're looking to change up their environments and move to these mixed use environments that are more exciting and provide a better ground floor plan for their employees and more excitement and more amenities. And we're seeing that in spades in Reston. Doug Linde : Bryan? Bryan Koop : Yes, ours is a little bit more varied. I'd say in at least two to three significant renewals, we had situations where we had clients that their initial space was well ahead of its time and how they work today isn't that much different than how it was when they did the original lease. But I would say that's just an example of three extraordinarily good, thoughtful plans from previously. And in those cases, they did some fresh up, they did some adding of some amenities, but nothing significant. But they're exceptional spaces to begin with and really thoughtful. On the new side, we're definitely seeing the willingness of the clients to add additional dollars of their own on top of tenant finish that we may provide to really create a great space. And I would also say that the amount of interest in seeing new space and examples of it is far more than I've ever seen. We just redid our own space on low 16. And it's incredible the response we've had from our own people, but we have probably at least a tour a day of clients coming to see it. I've never seen a situation where the clients want to talk to us this much about how we see trends and how we see future layouts. Owen Thomas : Yes, I would just add to this conversation from BXP standpoint, we're eating our own cooking. The Boston region and the San Francisco region were in space they had been in for well over a decade. And in the last six months, they've both moved. Here in Boston, it proved tower to a lower floor and in Embarcadero Center to a lower floor. And there is no doubt that the new build out has created a lot of energy and enthusiasm for our teams. And so we're experiencing this phenomena that you're hearing about firsthand. Operator : And I show our next question. It comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Caitlin Burrows : Hi, everyone. You mentioned earlier that the negative absorption spigots seem to have stopped in a few markets. And you did mention positive absorption in San Francisco in 4Q. But then you also mentioned that law firms in San Francisco are still reducing their footprint and others are rationalizing space. So it just makes it seem difficult that absorption would consistently increase, if that's what you're seeing from the tenants. So I'm wondering if you can give some details on what gives you confidence that absorption will continue to be positive in San Francisco. And is the demand there to then take advantage of the amenities that you're creating that you went through before? Doug Linde : Rod, you want to take that? Rodney Diehl : Yes, I mean there's no question that some of the existing, I would say, traditional tenants are still, in some cases, rightsizing. We've experienced it with some of our own law firm clients. I think you have to just add into that, the growing demand that is coming from these new technology companies. You can say it's AI, or you can just say it's the new wave of technology companies, which has traditionally brought the Bay Area and San Francisco in particular out of these down cycles. So we're seeing it. We're seeing lists of companies, names I've never even heard of, that are out in the market. And I think you can point to, obviously, the bigger AI deals with open AI and anthropic and scale AI and some of these others that have done deals as examples of tenants that are going to use space. And so we're going the right direction, and I think it finally showed up in another. So we'll see what happens, but it feels different than it did a year ago. I can tell you that much, Caitlin, for sure. Operator : Our next question. It comes from the line of Upal Rana from KeyBanc. Upal Rana : Great. Thank you. So the Biogen announced some layoffs to their research department last week, and they are your third largest tenant, and I was wondering if there was any potential impact for BXP, given they do only have about two and a half years left on their term, and is there any read-through on life science broadly on this announcement? Thanks. Doug Linde : So I think, look, Biogen is a company that has gone through many fits and starts over the decades that it has been in Kendall Square. We have one building with them, which is a lab building, that least expires in the middle of 2028, and that's basically in the midst of the next election cycle. There's so much that's going to happen between now and then. I can't even contemplate what the world will look like for lab space in Kendall Square, but it's the one location on the globe that I would rather have more than less lab space. And so to the extent that Biogen makes a decision to downsize or they grow, we'll be ready to capture whatever the opportunity is in that building. And again, it's the only building that we have with Biogen. The other building that we have is already been basically master leased to another organization and Biogen has not been in that building for the last 15 years. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dylan Burzinski from Green Street. Dylan Burzinski : Appreciate you taking the question, guys. Just going back to some of your comments on sort of the concessionary environment remaining elevated to what it once was. I guess in some of your tighter markets, at least within your portfolio, such as Boston and New York, are you guys starting to be able to push face rent so that on a net effective basis, we're starting to see incremental improvement? And then I guess as you sort of think about the next two years, right, going in \u201826 and \u201827, you guys mentioned being able to likely pick up significant occupancy. I mean, should we also expect you guys to be able to push net effective rent growth quite significantly in those years? Or can you sort of put some guardrails around that for us? Doug Linde : So unequivocally in the Midtown market and in the greater Boston Back Bay market, we, our rents are higher in 2024 than they were in 2023. And for the modest amount of space that we have available, they will be higher in 2025. In the Midtown Park Avenue market, same phenomenon, except the increase has been much larger. I mean, the increases are double digit in terms of what we have seen between \u201823 and \u201824 and what we probably will see in \u201825 to \u201826. I do not want to make a suggestion that we're going to see a groundswell of rental rate increases across all of our markets in the entire portfolio. I think those particular markets are unusual because of what we discussed earlier in the call relative to the minimus amount of large block availability and the fact that we're getting closer and closer to new construction pricing in Boston. We're not quite there yet and then obviously and we are where we are in Midtown Manhattan. But it's a very constructive environment in those marketplaces. It's not as constructed elsewhere. Mike LaBelle : I just think the one thing I would add Doug is that there's no new development because it's going to be coming in \u201826 and \u201827 in these markets. So from a supply perspective there's nothing to for those clients to look at so that will benefit us. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lewis from Truist Securities. Michael Lewis : Thank you. So you hit this topic of concessions and CapEx from a few different angles. When we put together the increased leasing volume as we get the occupancy back up and the higher cost, I don't think you give guidance for FAD but should we expect FAD and cash flow to be under pressure in the near term at least until you kind of stabilize the occupancy or is that not the case? Mike LaBelle : I'm not going to give a projection for \u201826 and \u201827 for FAD. I think for 2025 I feel pretty good about it. I think it will probably be a little bit lower than this year in line with kind of the FFO drop that we had this year. We do have free rent that is burning off so as I mentioned the cash flow from the portfolio is increasing. I don't expect our CapEx and TI to be significantly different than they were in \u201824, TI could be a little bit higher than it was in 2024, but I don't expect a meaningful change. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya from Deutsche Bank. Omotayo Okusanya : Yes, good morning. Just a very quick one, in regards to all the leasing activity kind of leasing up on the early renewals of leases that are going to be expiring in next year or a year or two and reducing leasing risk in \u201825 and \u201826, just curious how you think about balancing the certainty of renewal today versus maybe, again, waiting six to nine months where the leasing environment may feel a little bit better. And maybe we can kind of get better economics from a renewal. I am just kind of curios how you think through those two things to make the ultimate decision to kind of renew a little bit earlier. Doug Linde : So the BXP mentality is that we are not market timers. We would never have been, and we never will be. And if we have a client that wants to engage, we will constructively attempt to do a renewal with that client. I mean, the fact of the matter is, and everyone understands this, downtime is a cost of any transaction. And to the extent that you can eliminate downtime between a lease if the tenant were to leave or the tenant were to stay, that's a value, and that value can be split in a way with the renewal that it cannot be split with waiting for the next best tenant. And so from our perspective, we try and be commercial and thoughtful, and we try and work with our clients. And if our clients are interested in renewing, we do everything we can to renew them. Obviously, we have to be cognizant of what we think the market conditions are and where we think market rents are and where they might be going, but we never are going to be greedy, and we are never going to try in a market time. Operator : And I show a last question in the queue comes from the line of Jamie Feldman from Wells Fargo. Jamie Feldman : Great, thanks for taking a follow-up from our team. So we want to get your thoughts on how the rest of this office recovery may play out. The Park Avenue recovery was pretty unique this cycle with JP Morgan and Citadel's investments in leasing there. It's also encouraging to hear you say the Back Bay is tightening also. But do you think other sub-markets across your portfolio are structured to tighten up in the same way as the cycle continues, or do you think it will be more about filling specific buildings rather than sub-markets tightening in the future? And against that backdrop, can you also comment on the impairments taken in the quarter? Are these signals you don't expect these sub-markets to get better? Are they building specific, or are they a function of JV accounting rules? We found the Santa Monica impairment particularly interesting since our local market contacts indicate local schools are looking at the office campuses there as potential relocation options. Owen Thomas : I'll take the first part of that Jamie and I'll turn it over to Mike for the impairments. Look, the office market is recovering. It's recovering because of what we've been talking about on this call which is increased corporate confidence as well as return to office behavior. It's certainly the most acute in our portfolio in Midtown and in the Back Bay, but there's clearly spillover benefits. I mean Doug talked about the action that we have at 599 Lex. That's a spillover from Park Avenue. There's leasing going on Third Avenue. There's leasing going on Sixth Avenue. So it depends on the strength of the market, but there's clearly benefits away from these two markets that we're talking about. So look, how does it all shake out at the end of the day? It's hard to actually forecast. I do think there's probably some reduction in overall office demand because of the remote work phenomena. What percentage that is? I don't know, but don't forget you have that impact, but you also have a growing economy. So all these companies are growing. They're adding employees and at some point, the growth will make up for all of that. So I think those are the forces that you have at work and as we've been talking about over and over again, BXP is positioned as the premium office provider in the market and we're seeking to have clients that are leaders in their industries that will pay the premium rent that we're seeking and that segment of the office industry is outperforming materially the rest and that's one of the keys to our stability that we've experienced about this whole office phenomena. Doug Linde : Yes. And before Mike talks about the impairment, Rod, you can just -- you should comment on sort of what the activity level is for these schools and also whether they're really able to take space in the current configurations and for how long they're looking to sort of do these transactions and how that's sort of playing out in the West Valley market. Rodney Diehl : Yes, okay. So it's true there are schools that are in the market that are looking for some temporary space. We're talking with one of them. We've actually got a space in one of our buildings that is a sub lease space that this particular school is going to be occupying. So it's a temporary deal until they can figure out what they're going to do with a rebuild. Obviously, this is all pretty fresh and there's been just a lot of chaos down there and so we're doing our best possible to help the community. We've done it with this effort with the school. We also housed over 450 firefighters from Oregon and Utah at our Santa Monica Business Park. They just recently left. But they had been there, and they had all their trucks, and they were sleeping there, and it was, we've been very much engaged in trying to help support the community. But these schools, I mean, there's a few other ones that are out looking. We've heard there's a few other buildings in town that are talking to them. So that will absorb some portion of space, at least in the short term. Mike LaBelle : Congratulations, Jamie, for getting three questions in on one question. But we will. I will touch on the impairments. So impairments for consolidated assets are unusual because of the way the GAAP rules govern assets and the way that you value those if you're going to have a long-term hold on an effectively and undiscounted basis. Where we have unconsolidated joint ventures, there's different accounting rules that we have to abide by. So every quarter, we have to look at the valuations of our unconsolidated joint ventures and determine whether there's a change that has impacted what we think might be other than temporary in a change. And so on these West Coast assets, there's a combination of things where we haven't completed additional leasing in the vacant space at Colorado Center. We talked about the life science market at South San Francisco being slow. And in Seattle, we've talked about, we didn't talk about it on this call, but the market is slower and we haven't achieved positive absorption at Safeco Plaza. So every quarter, we evaluate this and look at the cash flows and value the assets. And it tripped our test this quarter. And so when it trips the other than temporary test, you basically have to bring it down to the fair market value, which is using a more kind of distressed discount and cap rate environment, which is why the numbers are bigger than they were. So it is an accounting issue. It is non-cash. It does not reflect any change in our outlook for these assets or any change in kind of what is going on in these assets right now. Doug Linde : And just one last point on this, Jamie. So obviously, our joint venture partner had their call yesterday on, and they, as I understand it, didn't mention anything on their Gateway investment. So it's consolidated on their books. It's unconsolidated on ours. So same asset. Our plans and their plans are the same. And we were in a position where we felt we had taken impairment. And obviously, they didn't. So again, these are accounting rules that we have to follow. Operator : That concludes our Q&A session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Owen Thomas, Chairman and CEO, for closing remarks. Owen Thomas : We have no closing remarks. We've gone an hour and a half. And we want to wish all of you a happy New Year. And thank you for your interest in BXP. Operator : Thank you, sir. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
