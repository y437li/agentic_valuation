Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the IntercontinentalExchange First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. Now I would like to turn the conference over to Kelly Loeffler. Please go ahead. Kelly L. Loeffler: Good morning. ICE's first quarter 2014 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investor section of our website at theice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the company's Form 10-K. Please note, that in addition to the GAAP results presented today, we've also referred to our adjusted operating results. These measures adjust our GAAP results for various extraordinary items, including our acquisition of NYSE Euronext, and we believe are more reflective of our core business performance than our GAAP results. You'll find a non-GAAP reconciliation and earnings release and presentation and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful, as well as how management uses these measures. Net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses. With us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Chuck Vice, President and Chief Operating Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Scott. Scott A. Hill: Thank you, Kelly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4, where we highlight our record results and the significant progress we've made during the quarter. Consolidated net revenues totaled $932 million, including strong contributions across our transaction, clearing and data businesses. We believe that performance demonstrates the value of the diversification of our global products and market, particularly in light of the muted volumes in certain energy and interest rate markets. We continue to focus on disciplined expense management and have now achieved over $220 million in synergies, double where we were in the fourth quarter, and well on track to the achievement of our stated objectives. And as a result of our strong revenue and expense performance, we delivered double-digit earnings growth with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.60, up 28%. Due to the first 4 months of 2014, we continue to make good progress on our integration and restructuring plans, including the planned IPO of Euronext and NYXT divestitures, along with the integration of Liffe in ICE Futures Europe. Even as we work on reorganizing and integrating NYSE Euronext, we remain focused on establishing new opportunities for future growth. We continue to expand our product offerings during the first quarter. And in February, we completed the acquisition of the Singapore Mercantile Exchange and clearing house, which we renamed to ICE Futures Singapore and ICE Clear Singapore. As you can see, it's been a busy and productive start to 2014. Please now turn to Slide 5, where I'll detail our first quarter results. Consolidated net revenues of $932 million benefited from strength across our agricultural, emissions and refined oil products, U.S. equity options, Euronext cash trading and CDS clearing. This revenue performance reflects growth of 1% compared to pro forma first quarter 2013 results. Further adjusting the prior year pro forma results to reflect the businesses now being recorded as discontinued operations, we've yielded revenue growth of 4% year-over-year. Adjusted operating expenses were $463 million and our consolidated adjusted operating margin was 50%. This is a notable improvement from the 45% pro forma operating margin we showed you on our November 19 strategic and financial update call. Adjusted operating expenses actually came in better than our guidance due to a number of one-off benefits, which were partially offset by negative currency impacts in the other expense line. Our first quarter expenses, excluding the one-off benefits would have landed in the lower end of our guidance range and operating margins still would've been a solid 49%. Our tax rate for the first quarter was 28%. Adjusted net income attributable to ICE grew 14% on a pro forma basis to $301 million, and adjusted EPS were $2.60 per share. And importantly, operating cash flows were $519 million, which is up 16% versus the combined operating cash flows of the 2 companies in the first quarter of 2013. And while you can't extrapolate first quarter cash flows to the full year due to annual liftings, billings and bonus payments, the first quarter results clearly demonstrate our ability to generate strong cash flow. This cash generation will enable us to delever, repurchase shares and continue to invest in future growth, including investments in operational capital expenditures and capitalized software, which were $49 million in the quarter. Let's move to Slide 6, where we detailed revenues and expenses for the ICE segment. On the left side of the chart, you can see that ICE segment revenues were $796 million, with nearly $500 million coming from net transaction and clearing revenues. Market data revenues were $103 million, including record revenue from ICE data. NYSE listings generated $82 million in revenue, and other revenue contributed $114 million in the first quarter. On the right side of the chart, you can see ICE segment expenses. First quarter adjusted expenses were $382 million and adjusted operating margin was 52%. As I mentioned previously, we had roughly $8 million in one-off noncash compensation and tax accrual benefits in the first quarter. Even adjusting for those benefits, and including an anticipated increase in our second quarter performance, base compensation due to the timing of grants in 2014, the ICE operating margin still would've been around 51%. Now let's turn to Slide 7, where I'll discuss the Euronext segment, which delivered a strong start to 2014. Net revenues for the first quarter were $136 million, or 44% from cash trading, 22% from market data and 13% from derivatives trading. This performance was driven by solid volume growth and cash equity, where ADV increased 16% year-over-year and was amplified by a 7% increase in revenue capture versus the prior quarter. While Euronext's derivatives volume decreased slightly, revenue capture actually increased. Euronext's operating margin was 41% and net income was $36 million for the first quarter of 2014. And importantly, these strong financial metrics do not yet reflect either the clearing economics Euronext began earning in April or the EUR 60 million in cost synergies the Euronext management team expects to deliver over the next 3 years. As a leading pan-European equities and derivatives platform in Europe, Euronext is led by a strong management team, produces strong cash flows and has low capital requirements. We continue to see a gradual improvement of the European economy and anticipate that this will enable Euronext to build upon the solid performance we saw in the first quarter. Moving on to Slide 8. I'll discuss our derivatives revenue in volumes in greater detail. Total futures and options revenue, including net revenue for U.S. equity options for the first quarter was $357 million. Notably, while volume trends were soft across energy and financials, we delivered revenue growth year-to-year in our derivatives business as a result of the addition of clearing for interest rates, a favorable mix in energy and interest rate contracts and solid revenue growth in our agricultural products. Daily volumes for futures and options in the quarter were 6.6 million contracts, a decrease of 13% year-to-year. However, daily volumes across ag and emission contracts were both up double digits year-to-year. Our ag revenues in the first quarter were $54 million, up 25% over last year's first quarter, due mainly to weather affecting crops in Brazil and price volatility across sugar, cocoa and coffee. The volume strength in ag and emissions was offset by decreases in volume, driven by low levels of volatility in our Brent gas oil and North American natural gas market. However, despite the volume declines in natural gas, thanks to the strong performance in our European natural gas market, overall net gas revenues actually increased slightly versus the prior year. And while the ICE gas oil futures contract volumes continue to be impacted by the transition to the low sulfur contract specification, the transition will be completed at the end of May, which should help volumes return to more normalized levels. Interest rate futures volumes declined in the first quarter as absolute rates remained low, particularly in Euribor. Despite lower overall volume, interest rate contributed $80 million in revenue in the quarter, which includes clearing revenues that were not included in last year's first quarter due to third party clearing arrangements. Before leaving this slide, I want to note that although we have seen softer volumes in some of our benchmark energy contracts, open interest trends remained healthy. As we close the first quarter, we saw record open interest across many of our benchmark contracts, including Brent and ag, which were up 16% and 14%, respectively, in the end of 2013. And as we've seen before, once volatility and seasonal activity returns, healthy open interest levels generally translate into volume growth. Next, on Slide 9, I'll update you on our CDS business. We reported CDS revenues of $43 million in the first quarter, driven by record clearing revenues of $26 million, which were up 64% compared to the prior first quarter. We believe that market participants see the value of clearing CDS on the ICE clearing platform due to the investments we've made, which ensure that we have the most comprehensive global offering and risk framework. In March, we launched clearing for Markit iTraxx Senior Financial CDS index instrument. And 2 weeks ago, ICE Clear Europe began clearing Western European sovereign CDS. Moving on to Slide 10. I'll talk about our strong cash generation and capital management. We closed the quarter with over $1 billion in unrestricted cash and short-term investments and we generated operating cash flow of $519 million, up 16% from the prior year. We expect to continue to generate strong cash flows from operations, as well as from the Euronext IPO and the divestiture of certain NYSE Technology's businesses. We intend to use this cash flow to delever to our adjusted debt to EBITDA target of 1.5x, continue investing for growth, and resume our share buyback program. We remain focused on delivering returns on investments that are above our cost of capital and better than our peers. And we declared our intention to pay a $0.65 per share dividend, again, in the second quarter. Finally, during the quarter, we worked to further optimize our debt structure. On April 3, we entered into a new 5-year $3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and used our commercial paper to pay down our $367 million term loan. For the balance of 2014, we expect quarterly interest expense in the range of $24 million to $25 million, which is lower than our prior guidance. Let's move to Slide 11, where we've highlighted a few items to clarify financial reporting questions. I won't walk through the entire slide, but will touch briefly on the ICE segment of the revenue, which was $114 million in the first quarter. There are several revenue streams that comprise this line item, such as technology services, trading license fees and regulatory listed company service fees, among others. As part of the integration process, we have now moved the Liffe clearing fees out of other revenues and into transaction and clearing revenues for the first quarter. Previously, Liffe clearing revenues were reported in the other revenue lines rather than transaction and clearing revenue. As you would expect, this resulted in our reported first quarter RPC being understated for ags, metals and financials. Therefore, on this slide, we updated RPC to include clearing. This is also reflected in our April volume release and has no impact to total revenues. I'll conclude my remarks on Slide 12 with an update to our current guidance. Please note that our guidance includes Euronext and excludes nonstrategic NYSE technologies businesses that are reported in discontinued operations. For the second quarter 2014, we expect that other revenues will be in the range of $120 million to $130 million. Adjusted consolidated operating expenses for the second quarter are expected to be between $485 million to $495 million. The increase in second quarter expense guidance versus that provided in the first quarter is due to roughly $15 million in additional expenses in the Euronext business. This is primarily driven by $3 million to $4 million related to investments required to operate Euronext on a standalone basis and $9 million to $10 million, related to Euronext's new derivatives clearing arrangement, which began on April 1. Notably, that clearing arrangement is also expected to generate $16 million to $17 million of incremental revenue in the second quarter, assuming volumes are similar to the first quarter. For the ICE segment, adjusted for the one-off items noted previously, we expect adjusted operating expenses to be relatively stable and in the range of $390 million to $400 million for the second quarter. And for the full year 2014, we expect adjusted operating expenses of $1.56 billion to $1.58 billion. Importantly, we are on course to achieve 70% of our synergies or $350 million as we exit 2014. For the second quarter of 2014, we expect capital expenditures and capitalized software of $60 million to $65 million. And for the year, we will invest $200 million to $210 million, excluding real estate expenditures. This figure is higher than our previous CapEx guidance due to investments to standardize and increase the efficiency of our technology platform at the NYSE. D&A expense for 2014 is expected to be between $360 million and $370 million, including $85 million to $90 million in the second quarter. Finally, we continue to expect an effective tax rate of between 27% and 30%. We are well into the second quarter and are continuing to respond to our customers\u2019 needs through product innovation, risk management and compliance solutions. We're executing on our strategic initiatives and are well positioned to continue to grow our revenues, achieve double-digit earnings growth and generate strong cash flows and value for our shareholders. I'll be happy to take your questions during our Q&A session. Jeff, over to you. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Thank you, Scott. That was a lot to digest. Today, I'd like to cover our energy and interest rate futures business, provide some thoughts on U.S. equity market structure and discuss the progress that we've made on integrating NYSE Euronext. Over the long term, trading and risk management activities continue to move on exchange and into clearing houses. While this trend was already underway and we began clearing energy swaps in 2002, it was only accelerated with the implementation of Dodd-Frank. With the near implementation taking place in Europe over the next year, the trend towards clearing is also playing out there. We're focused on meeting regulatory requirements and the demand for new products and capital efficiency. We're expanding our reach globally, most recently into Asia, to address the demand for market infrastructure. We believe that Asia will also implement financial reforms focused on enhancing risk management and supporting the development of regulated clearing houses. Ships in the global economy are driving demand, as the pan-Asian region moves to becoming the largest global consumer of commodities. With economic and regulatory change reshaping markets around the world, our geographic and product diversity across commodity and financial products, and our ability to evolve as markets change, position us very well for the long term. You can see the breadth of our energy markets on Slide 13, including the expansion activity through economic cycles and through regulatory change. Since the beginning of the financial crisis in 2008, our energy revenues have grown at a compound rate of 13% annually. And this is consistent with ICE futures Europe's 17 consecutive years of record volume. On the slide, you can see the strong base of revenue across the diversified mix of energy products, which are relied upon each day by global energy companies and consumers. While financial reform has had the effect of pushing some banks to exit their physical commodities operation, we continue to see a strong role for banks as they facilitate customer business in these markets. And consistent with our focus on commercial end-users, you can see in our Commitment of Trader reports that well over half of our open interest in energy is from commercial market participants. Moving forward to Slide 14, we've highlighted some of the trends underlying our global oil business. Brent crude volumes were softer in Q1 due to multiyear lows and price volatility with prices locked in a tight range. In addition, the former pricing curve for Brent was in contango for the first quarter, while the WTI market stayed in backwardation. Nevertheless, open interest grew at a healthy clip and stands at record levels, as you can see with the green light on the left. On the right side, you can see the over 80% compound annual growth rate and our suite of refined oil products. This demonstrates how the benchmark Brent contract has attracted customers who now trade a full range of refined oil products. Today, our oil contracts number over 400. In the second quarter, we expect to launch 64 new energy contracts, over 20 of which are oil products. I'll also point out, the contracts represented by the blue bars on the same chart, represent products where our market share has grown from 0 to over 13% in just a few years\u2019 time. This represents meaningful capital efficiencies at the clearing level. Moving to Slide 15. You can see the trends on our global natural gas markets. While North American natural gas volumes have declined year-to-year during the past several quarters, average daily volume for the first quarter was 25% above the first quarter of 2010, and open interest has doubled and remained significantly above precrisis levels. This demonstrates solid growth in the user base and in demand for hedging. And while U.S. natural gas prices lack volatility in the last months, this is a solid business due to the increasingly important role that natural gas holds, both in North America and around the world. On the right side of the slide, you can see the robust growth in our natural gas contracts traded on ICE Futures Europe, particularly following our acquisition and subsequent launch of the ICE Endex business last year. Through ICE Endex, we now list the primary European gas benchmarks, and the efficiencies of this model are driving growth. I've long spoken about our view of the increasing globalization of natural gas products. And this quarter, you can see this trend in our results. As a result of the solid performance in the non-U.S. natural gas markets, ICE's total natural gas revenues actually increased 1% during the quarter, where European volume growth of 64% offset the double-digit decline in our North American volume. Turning to interest rates on the next few charts, starting on Slide 16. You can see the underlying trends in our Liffe interest rates complex. First, daily volumes have returned, and in some cases, exceeded precrisis levels. And this is despite a low interest rate environment impacting our benchmark short-term contract, the Euribor future. However, open interest across our European interest rate futures complex is up 21% from the start of this year. On Slide 17, you can see one of the primary drivers within the Liffe rates complex is the sterling futures contract, where daily volumes grew 30% in the first quarter and open interest over 80% from year end. This contract is a proxy for U.K. economic sentiment and expectations for the Bank of England's actions on interest rates. With economic indicators improving, the short sterling contract has been active. On Slide 18, you can see the diversity of our growing interest rate complex. Growth in our Gilt futures volumes reflect the rising demand for rate hedging, further out the yield curve, where we've grown volume and over -- interest over 2 years. Volume in the swap note contract, which was the first launched futures swap to futures interest rate product. And now in its 13th year, was up 32% over last year's first quarter, with open interest increasing double digits over the same period. Last month, we introduced the Ultra Long Gilt Futures contract, which has attracted solid volume growth and open interest since our launch. These products are not only performing well, but they'll be joined by 21 new European interest rate contracts that we're introducing this quarter. So you can see that we're very engaged in building out a leading European rates platform. In addition, our team is working to ensure a smooth transition of the Liffe market to the ICE futures platform by year end. We believe that this investment will create operational and capital efficiencies that will drive value for customers and for shareholders. Moving now to Slide 19. I want to note the strength of our listings business for 2 reasons : first, because The New York Stock Exchange continues to lead in the amount of capital raised, as well as in technology IPOs, as we move to the halfway point of 2014. But more importantly, I want to talk about the importance of a healthy market for our issuers. It's vital that we continue to attract companies to the public markets, because they trust the fairness and stability of these markets. The pie will grow for all if investor confidence in markets is strong. The U.S. capital markets are the deepest, most liquid markets in the world for capital raising. And they're a key source of competitiveness of our economy globally. Access to public capital fuels innovation and creates jobs for economies around the world. Issuers and investors need confidence that the markets are transparent and that they are fair. It's that trust and confidence that keeps the flywheel of capital flowing. In this regard, let me address a few ideas around how we can improve the structure in our equity market. For the past year, I've suggested that this market could be simplified and that the pendulum has swung too far on complexity. While a year ago, my comments were not widely supported within our industry, the current conversation has led to increasing support and an opportunity to dialogue in earnest on the important issues facing this industry. You can see on Slide 20, many of the developments that ICE brought to improve confidence in the commodity and derivative markets that we serve. It's important to note that this progress is a result of the extensive work with our customers and our regulators. And as we bring our experience into derivatives, we'll continue to work closely with customers and regulators to drive positive change in the equity markets that we serve. Many parties share responsibility for today's market model, including incumbent exchanges like The New York Stock Exchange. Most importantly, we, in the industry, must provide the leadership to respond to needed change. And we're encouraged by the SEC's work and recent comments acknowledging the need to address market complexity. Years ago, the market's reaction to a perceived lack of transparency and fairness was to create competition at the exchange level. Ultimately, this went further than most could have anticipated. And this has led to extreme fragmentation, with over 50 venues to trade the same lifted securities. While a national market system linking these venues together is a worthy goal, it has resulted in an overly complex structure with many unintended consequences. Historically, markets naturally formed up in a single venue to establish liquidity and the best price discovery. Today's fragmentation of such standardized markets is unnatural for the ultimate end-user and it tends to be promoted by those who seek to benefit from assets to better information. With extreme fragmentation, buyers and sellers have no choice but to seek to form a single price discovery stream by employing smart order routers, algorithms and high-frequency strategies. And to maintain liquidity, you've seen the convergence of market makers and high-frequency trading firms with very little means to distinguish meritorious activity from that, which can be disruptive. What I believe is being launched in the evolution of the equity market is that the essential form of competition that we should be improving is that between the buyers and sellers of securities, both of whom are seeking to discover the best price for themselves. This means that the concept of competition should not be focused exclusively on creating more exchange venues, whose propagation continues with no end in sight. There seems to be no justification, now that studies are showing that pricing benefits are being reversed, and where the public price discovery function for end-users is being weakened. It's certainly a positive fact that technology and automation has tightened bid offer spreads, but the fragmentation and instability of the market today has also increased its risk and complexity. In a Monday article in USA Today, it comments, \"This week marks the fourth anniversary of the brutal flash crash that rocketed markets on May 6, 2010, and is a stark reminder of how little has changed.\" Our market structure might have created a better pie with lower exchange fees and tighter spreads, but it is a shrinking pie that fewer want to consume. Americans are seeking other investments, instead of providing the fuel to our listed companies. It's also a positive fact that technology and competition in the U.S. equity markets has dramatically reduced exchange fees and improved access. For example, a retail customer buying 100 shares of stock may pay $9.95 to an online broker, not $800 as in times past. Today, if that trade was routed to a U.S. regulated exchange, the revenue capture would average about $0.02. In other words, an amount that is insignificant to that total transaction. Only about $0.02 would go to an exchange on a $10 broker commission. Similarly, a large institutional fund manager buying 100 shares of stock today would pay their broker something like $1. The U.S. exchange capture is yet again about $0.02, similarly insignificant to this transaction; and so low, that it should not justify the existence of off exchange trading as a need to avoid excessive exchange fees, particularly where there's an absence of meaningful price or size improvement. And by definition, the avoidance of transacting on a regulated exchange is also the avoidance of regulatory oversight and the removal of price signals that contribute to the public price formation process. We've advocated for the regulatory elimination of maker-taker fees coupled with the reduction and equalization of access fees in the U.S. equity markets. This would expose the low exchange capture fees that I just mentioned, directly to all market participants. Maker-taker fees also create incentives for intermediaries to potentially place their own interest ahead of the obligation to customers. And I believe the vast majority of brokers are honest actors who want to place their customer's interests first, but they're being put in an increasingly untenable position with regard to best execution requirements. And in order to protect market participants for regulatory breaches and while availing themselves of maker-taker rebates, execution venues have further complicated markets by creating order types that play into maker-taker capture, such as the well-named \"Hide don't slide,\" among others. The imbalance in maker-taker fees creates fee arbitrageurs that add to market volume, while simply trying to buy on one exchange and sell on another in risk-free trades, while not actually wanting to own stocks. Encouraging transient liquidity signals is potentially as risky as encouraging transient price signals. Because traders not only rely on price information, they also rely on volume information when making trading decisions. The SEC has already placed limits on exchange fees. And thus, we believe that these limits could be updated to eliminate maker-taker pricing, while equalizing exchange access fees at lower levels for all investors. The New York Stock Exchange had a significant opportunity to offer solutions that rebuild confidence and protect shareholder value. And we believe that we can start by unilaterally reducing the excessive complexity that exists today, such as the proliferation of order types. Therefore, the first step towards making our markets less complex, we will voluntarily reduce the number of order types at our U.S. equity exchanges. We've identified over 1 dozen existing order types that we plan to apply to the SEC for rule changes to eliminate. And beyond that, we will continue to evaluate our other order types to identify those that may not be providing the market with true utility. Too many of these order types were developed in an attempt to replicate dark pool trading or to segment the market to try to attract one type of investor over another type of investor. The SEC has recently completed a comprehensive audit of order types, and we believe that exchanges and dark pools should adopt a moratorium on creating any new types of orders. We had a spirited internal debate on whether we should unilaterally begin eliminating order types, and certainly, there were some who did not initially like this idea. You see, we have 1/2 a dozen-or-so more new order types that are in the works, and some of them have already been built into our matching engines and are ready to launch. These new order types are smart, they're innovative, and some may really put the hurt on our competition. However, I suspect that they will further fragment the U.S. equities market, which will ultimately hurt investors. My colleagues worry that our competition won't share our end user concerns and they'll continue to develop products that'll further fragment the market. If this is so, I reminded them that maybe we should be paying our competitors salaries because I believe they're setting themselves up for long-term failures. Today, the average order size on the 5 largest alternative trading venues has fallen to a little more than 200 shares, an amount that is near or, in some cases, below the size of regulated market order fills. As smart order routers are now slicing up orders into small digestible bites, today, there is very little difference between retail order fills and large institutional order fills, increasingly obsoleting the need for trading venues to segment our customers or segment their trading behaviors by offering differing order types or by even having different regulatory oversight. In light of a number of articles that I've recently seen, I want to also spend a moment to describe our market data offerings. Our U.S. equity exchanges produce and sell raw data feeds, which include every single quote and cancellation that is submitted to the matching engine. Pursuant to an agreement we have with the SEC, we make sure that our raw data feeds are not made available to customers any sooner than the data is made available to the national securities information processors, also known as SIPs. So in other words, it's a rule that everyone receive raw -- the raw data feed at the same time, including the SIPs. Now the major broker-dealers are co-located in our facilities and receive raw data feeds at the same time as latency-sensitive traders. And unlike other regulated markets where ICE operates that allow for direct access, broker-dealers are the sole access point for customer trade execution on U.S. equity exchanges. UNI's [ph] investors do not choose where our trades are routed to, and we're not allowed to access U.S. equity exchanges directly. Therefore, as long as a co-located broker-dealer's interests are aligned with its customers' interests, retail and institutional customers of major broker-dealers should see no speed advantage and no speed disadvantage in these markets. Now some had called for us to further slow down the raw data feeds to match the output of the SIPs, but this would likely have exactly the opposite impact that its proponents are trying to achieve. Recall that traders currently receive their trade confirmations from matching engines at their native speeds, and active traders who are constantly buying and selling small numbers of shares, see stocks move through various price levels by employing this trading strategy. If the raw data were delayed to match the output of the SIP, this would give active traders significantly earlier knowledge of stock movements, well before the public, as a result of their active trade confirmations. This time advantage would be big enough to drive a truck through. That's why simply slowing down the raw data feed would only create more problems. However, we do believe that there are a number of solutions that could be enacted to better ensure parity, so long as they were adopted by the entire industry. We could slow the raw data feeds or combine the raw data and the SIPs into single feeds or use technology to further speed up the SIPs. But all that would have to be done while simultaneously slowing trade confirmations, including those from dark pool matching engines to eliminate all trade data information advantages. But again, such speed equivalence changes would need to be universally adopted for them to have any impact, given today's fragmented market structure. I'd like to talk about co-location and why it's important that it remains a regulated business. We believe that co-location is the most fair way to serve both the latency and non-latency-sensitive customers. Let me illustrate. ICE's commodities business uses third-party data centers to house our matching engines. And years ago, we began hearing of traders that were offering to pay our data center operator larger fees if they could move their systems closer to our matching engine. We decided to work with our landlord to develop cable links and router configurations that were equal for everyone in the building who were trying to connect to us, regardless of where their specific location was in that building. Thus, it was out of a sense of preserving fair access that the co-location business was born. We continue to examine the co-location offerings at our data centers to make certain that their use is appropriate, codified and fair. And finally, let me mention that the U.S. equity market simply has to look to its cousin, the U.S. equity options market to adopt best practices and a good regulatory model. For example, off-exchange trading is allowed, but those trade opportunities must be offered to others in regulated markets. Market makers have true price quoting obligations, and in return, they receive fee discounts and additional messaging capacity. Exchanges have rules and fines to deter excessive orders from being sent and from being canceled. All of these features are very similar to what we've already implemented in our futures market, and all of these features in the U.S. equity options markets are regulated. Clearly, we spent a lot of time during my tenure at ICE thinking about and solving for better market structures, whether it was the market for OTC energy, the market for Credit Default Swaps or now the U.S. cash equities markets. And I believe that one of the things that ICE does well is to facilitate change for the better that help our markets to grow. And I'm really hopeful that our team can advance the dialogue here. In the meantime, as we've discussed today, we're busy executing on a range of initiatives that we now have listed on Slide 21. Each of these is helping us to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow and serve our customers in an expanded way. We closed on the NYSE transaction just about 6 months ago. And since then, we've implemented a dividend, we've completed the acquisition of the Singapore Exchange and clearing house, and we've led in the global listings business. We completed several milestones related to the IPO of Euronext and the sale of some of our technology businesses while delivering on expense synergies and rolling out many, many new products. We launched our Benchmark Administration business, covering now both LIBOR and the fixed indices. We began developing a new trading platform for our U.S. cash equities business and our equity option exchanges, and we continue to transition the Liffe exchanges to ICE. We're not waiting for the business to come to us. We're going to where our customers need us to be, and we look forward to continuing to report to you on this progress. I want to conclude my remarks by referring you to Slide 22. And note that ICE's growth is consistent and we have found opportunities for growth amid change. We focus on our customers' needs every day, and in doing so, we've been able to drive shareholder value. So I want to thank our customers for trusting us with their business, and I want to thank our team for delivering these great results. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator, Emily, for a Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill. Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : Yes. The first question is on expenses, just to get away from the market structure debate for just 1 sec. But Scott, just following your walk on expenses, if you take your $463 million, add the $8 million onetime, you had $471 million. And I think I've got here where there's $15 million of extra Euronext to get you to $485 million in the low end. But it doesn't seem -- if you double the synergies in the quarter from -- to $220 million, I think you'd expect to start realizing, I guess, at least $25 million-or-so additional. So I'm just trying to follow the walk here and the realization of this -- the doubling of the synergies in the quarter. Scott A. Hill: Yes. So, Rich, you did the walk almost perfectly. The only other thing I would add is in the second quarter, we'll see a little bit of an increase in our noncash expense. We were a little delayed in issuing our performance-related restricted shares this year. And so we only had 1 month in the first quarter. We'll have 3 months in the rest of the quarter. So that will move you right back into the middle of the guidance once you add in the $15 million of Euronext expense, which again, for clarity, is 100% of the reason the guidance went up and is more than offset by the additional revenues that we would expect based on first quarter volumes and the clearing agreement. But your question about the synergies, Rich, what I was saying and what I said in our February earnings call was that the first quarter expenses reflect that $220 million achievement. It's in the run rate. And then what I also said on that February call, and I'll repeat here, is that we would expect a little bit more. I think I said $15 million to $20 million as you go through the year of additional synergy realization. But that's going to come from the work we're doing to integrate the corporate staff, to integrate the Liffe business, and so that's going to be more in the back end of the year. And so what I said then, and I'll repeat again here, is we would expect 1Q, 2Q to be kind of stable. And then as you get to the back end of the year, it will trail off a little bit as those synergies bleed in. Also embedded in this, consistent with what we said in February, is we are making investments. I said $40 million to $50 million that would support revenue growth of $100 million to $140 million. If you adjust for disc ops, we drove over $30 million of revenue growth in the first quarter alone. So we are seeing the revenue growth. We are making the investment to continue to grow our business. Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : That helps. That gets me there, and now back to the market structure. Jeff, thanks for all the detailed comments. Now you can see what you've been missing just being a derivatives exchange recent prior. So -- but I guess the question is -- it gets to the topic of what you can do unilaterally and what you can't. I've seen you stepped up in regards to the order types. But in regards to market data, you need the industry. And so anyway, the question is on the maker-taker model. Some at best -- if you're that dead set against it, why don't you -- you could take a step. Can you explain why you couldn't? And I believe it has to do with best execution. And what do you see as the one priority thing that will get -- reduces complexity and fragmentation that we're confronting in the equity markets, the cash equity markets? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Yes, so it's a very good question. I wish we could act unilaterally. But today, in the world of smart order routers, as we change fees, those smart order routers react instantaneously. And we suspect that if we went to a single 2-sided rate, we can look at others that have that rate, and those smart order routers will basically leave us in the dust. And the New York -- if you look at the volume on the exchanges and trading platforms that have low 2-sided rates, their market share is probably less than 1%. And we're not going to take the New York Stock Exchange down to less than 1% market share. It's why -- I think there is a mechanism already that the SEC has set limits on what exchanges can charge. And I'm really suggesting that I think those should be revisited, and I think the more support that the industry will provide for a revisiting of those rates, the more likely it is that the SEC will put that up on their priority list. I will tell you that we've had many, many meetings with the SEC at all levels, and I find them to be very engaged and interested in making sure that we have a well-functioning U.S. capital markets system. I've been very impressed with them, and they've been incredibly gracious to listen to me and some of my ideas. And so I have quiet confidence that as more people speak out about improvements, that we'll see the industry coalesce around some good ideas. Operator : Our next question is from Christian Bolu of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Chinedu Christian Onwugbolu - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Scott, just quickly, just to make sure my math is right, if I just look at the core ICE segment expenses of $463 million and back out the Euronext expenses, and then I compare that segment to your expense account for the year, it feels like expenses, even for core ICE, is going up through the year. Help me just think about anything in terms of incremental investment spend versus the synergy you're talking about being realized at the end of the year. Scott A. Hill: Yes. Again, I mentioned in my remarks that we had about $8 million of kind of one-off accrual credits that we had in the first quarter, and then I mentioned in answer to Rich's question that we had -- we'd have an increase related to our performance RSUs in the second quarter. Once you adjust those things in, there is no increase in expense 1Q to 2Q or right in the middle of the range, and we're right where we said we'd be and where we'd expect to be. And importantly, you guys recall that we suggested that once we peeled Euronext out and put the NYSE businesses in disc ops, that we would anticipate margins would've been around 48% to 49%. In the quarter, they were 51%, even adjusted for those one-off items. You take the guidance and put it against relatively flat revenues from the first quarter, those margins are going to remain right around 50%. So we're right where we've said we'd be, right where we would expect to be and very happy with the progress we've made. Chinedu Christian Onwugbolu - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. I just want to hit on -- hit specifically on the European interest rate complex? And just more broadly speaking, how do you think about your opportunity in the longer-term products? Do you think you can actually win share from the current incumbent? Or is the focus here really more on creating kind of newer products? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: It's -- again, it's a good question. I mean, the answer is we really just talk to our customers about what their needs are, and then we try to solve for those issues. And that may mean, in some cases, share is taken, and certainly, it means that we're going to be creating new opportunities and ideas. And I'm quite proud of the fact that we stood up a brand-new business that had no employees and no history and convinced the market that we should administer the LIBOR oversight and now again convince the market that we should take over the administration of the ISDA fix process. Those businesses put us very, very close to our customers daily, hourly contact with people talking about where the markets are moving. And they, in part, domain knowledge to us and give us insight into where our customers are thinking, where they're having stress points. And I think couple that with the fact that I'm very, very proud of what our colleagues have built in our clearing infrastructure, with the really sophisticated models and the quants that we've been able to attract and hire who increasingly are getting deeper into managing risk. I think we're just incredibly well positioned. We're lucky to have the Liffe rates complex now come to us. And that's a very, very good starting point for us to do both things that you suggest, to take market share from others and also continue to launch new products. So I think long story short, we're feeling very, very good about where life has taken us right now. I mean L-I-F-E. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : So, Jeff, you gave an update on Euronext just in terms of the June timeframe. Maybe just give us an update there in terms of what other regulatory approvals have to get done? And then, Scott, maybe just when you look at -- I guess it's tough to go into too much detail. But when you look at the valuation out there and maybe more the ownership percentage versus what you guys can release, just how can that either shift or accelerate over time? Just your, I guess, cash deployment opportunities and not just on Euronext, but we put that together with tech and then just the overall cash flow of the business throughout the rest of the year. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Let me ask Scott to answer both questions since he's been really helping to drive that IPO. Scott A. Hill: Okay. Yes, I'll tell you what I can on the process, Mike. As you would anticipate, the last step before we file the IPO later this quarter is we need the final approval from the College of Regulators. And I think we have a very good dialogue going on with them with regards to that process. We're well along in the process of putting the prospectus together, well along in the process of educating some of the potential investors. So we feel good about where we are in the process. That's why we've continued to stake this date. Clearly, we can't say with certainty when that regulatory approval will come. But we're pretty confident and feel good about where we are in the process right now but still, frankly, a lot of work to be done. With regards to what happens at the time of the IPO, that's hard to say without knowing what the market dynamics are at the time we launch or what the demand is at the time we launch. What I can tell you is what we've said publicly before, which is if required, we've committed to be a stable shareholder in Euronext for a period of time. But again, there's no certainty around that either as we move through the process. So I think the net of it is, we feel very good about where we are. We remain confident that we're on track to get it done. And to your question on cash use, as I said in the remarks, first of all, I thought the first quarter cash results really demonstrated the cash we can generate just from the business. Clearly, depending on the size of the stake we can sell on Euronext, that will help us accelerate our deleveraging. And then as you mentioned, the divestiture of the NYSE Technologies businesses will also fund that. So yes, we feel pretty good about where we are, not just with regards to the Euronext IPO but with cash generally and our ability to get our deleveraging done on time, if not more quickly, and then get back to our share repurchases and investing in our growth. Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : All right. And then, Jeff, just a follow-up. Just on the outlook for volumes, and I know there's a bunch of different trends that can have impacts, but I guess, when we look at it, if we look at some of the energy products, you're definitely on the rate side and even on the FX side. There's a lot of things that are having impact, but if you look at some of the regulatory pressures on the big financial institutions and even on clients, in an indirect way, do you see that as having much of an impact? Or is it the typical things that tend to impact your business in terms of low volatility, some macro uncertainty? Just trying to get any insight on just what you guys look at what's driving it and maybe what could be some levers moving forward to pick up the volumes. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Yes. So let me just say natural -- the U.S. natural gas markets are the markets where Chuck and I really first started ICE, and they remain core to our hearts for that reason. And we had, in the United States, as most of you know, very cold winter, colder than expected. And so people who were trading natural gas either made a lot of money or lost a lot of money, depending upon where you were positioned. And so part of, I think, the quietness of the natural gas markets right now is that we're in a shoulder month period and a lot of our customers are going back and scratching their heads and looking at what happened over the winter before they decide their positioning for summer and beyond. That has nothing to do with -- that has to do with weather, not regulatory issues. That being said, there's definitely a sense of totality of regulation that is sweeping over our customers. And it's complex, and it's somewhat unknown. And there is some trepidation, and dates and deadlines continue to move. And so we do -- we are having unbelievably active dialogue with our customers, trying to help them as we figure out where we need to be to meet those same kinds of dates and deadlines. So there does feel to be kind of appall, if you will, on hedging and trading activity right now as people digest a relatively large and new regulatory regime globally. I think, however, as I said in my prepared remarks, the trend is for exchanges and transparency to be embraced. And we've positioned ourselves well as a transparent and regulated exchange and clearing house venue. Scott A. Hill: And as we mentioned as well, I mean, we continue to see OI trends that are stable to significantly improving. We mentioned Brent and ICE being up 16% and 14% year-to-year. And, Mike, as we talked about from time to time, I look at the fact that we continue to see more people log into the system, more IDs. So the people are definitely there. The OI, the open positions are definitely there. And so as we mentioned in the remarks, once the volatility returns, we feel pretty well positioned. Operator : Our next question is from Jillian Miller of BMO Capital. Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: One thing that wasn't totally clear to me from the comments, do you think that we basically need to do away with maker-taker entirely to really see a healthier market? Or do you think that just a lower cap on access fees might be enough on that front? And I guess, like, how do you see the longer-term market outcomes being different for those 2 potential regulatory changes? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Yes, I personally think as long as we're talking about changing it, we should abolish it. I do not believe that it's healthy for exchanges and trading venues to pay for order flow. People talk about that as if it is liquidity, but because they are both maker-taker venues and then taker-maker venues, you end up with people buying on one venue and selling on another venue and not having any interest in really owning shares. And in other markets where we've got competitors that are doing massive payment for order flow and rebate structures, we end up with customers that want to advantage themselves of those. And what they do is they end up doing big low-risk trades, trades that are way out the curve, butterfly trades that carry no risk or low risk. They do them in the middle of the night. They do these big volume trades, and then the exchanges all go run around and talk about how fabulous their volumes are and use that as a marketing move technique to try to attract the true hedgers into a market that really, by that design, is incredibly illiquid and is a roach motel. And so I am not a fan of market structures that create false volume. I think there are plenty of people in our markets today, and you see them all through the historical markets that ICE has been involved in, that are willing to be market makers, legitimate market makers that will make a 2-way price and provide liquidity into the market, many using high-speed trading techniques that are helpful and meritorious to the market in exchange for access, discounts and other traditional market-making compensation that does not involve payment for order flow in the form of maker-taker or direct subsidies. And so I don't know why we wouldn't just go all the way. I think if you reduce this, it will certainly help. But again, false volume signals, I think, are as wrong as false price signals, which -- in which case, most people would go to jail. And I don't know why we should make the distinction when we all know that our customers are looking at both in making investment decisions. Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay, that's helpful. And then, Scott, you had mentioned that there was, I think, you said $30 million of revenue growth in the first quarter alone that came from investments that you had made. And I apologize if I missed this in some other prepared remarks, but could you just give us a better idea for kind of what that was related to, like where that $30 million came from? Was that investments post-transaction, like, related to the deal? I'm just a little bit confused there. Scott A. Hill: No, I didn't link the 2 directly. What I said was in the first quarter, we did see $30 million of revenue growth. If you adjust 2013 for discontinued operations revenues and look year-over-year, we were up about 4%, a little more than $30 million. And what I was suggesting was, we are making investments this year to continue to generate revenue growth. So I was really just talking back to the same comments I made in February. Operator : Our next question is from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : First on other revenue, a hefty $134 million this quarter, and you've done some rejiggering to what is reported in that line. At this point, what is the composition of other revenue? How variable should it be from 1 quarter to the next? And why was the guidance down versus 1Q levels? Scott A. Hill: Yes. So, Ken, I think in my prepared remarks, I mentioned that there are membership fees, there are transaction services, there are the corporate governance businesses that we own. And so if -- there are networking colo, so there are a number of items that make up other. It's a bit of a mishmash. We had a few million dollars in the first quarter related to a termination of a contract that won't continue through the rest of the year. We gave guidance for the quarter of $120 million to $130 million. And I think you could expect -- and by the way, you take out the few million dollars to -- for that onetime, we would have been right at the top end of that range. And I think similar to what you've seen in the past, through ICE other revenues, you should expect stability in that range throughout the year. Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay, great. And then maybe just I wanted to hear additional comments on Nat Gas. Given the volatility in January and February, are you hearing that this is or will lead to how much is hedged and how gas is kind of traded going forward? And is there any merit to a potential transition to more shale gas trading where ICE has such a dominant presence? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: I think -- we look at our OI trends. And the -- while trading has been subdued in these shoulder months, the OI trends are still quite good in North American natural gas. In Europe, as I commented, like, our -- what we've been able to do there is unbelievably successful. And so many of the global trading companies are -- have been active in Europe while they've been quiet in the U.S. So we've seen them kind of shift their market-making, risk-taking appetite to where the markets warrant. So I don't see anything long term structurally negative. It's just we are aware that it was very, very interesting over the winter on some of -- where some of our customers were positioned. And they were either right or wrong, many of them. And so people go back and rejigger their models and think about their personnel and think about their capital deployment. And it feels like that's what they're doing over these spring months. Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. But in terms of corporates, the corporates aren't changing the way they hedge to go to Pennsylvania gas as opposed to Henry Hub. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: No, not really. Henry Hub is still is the marker for the U.S. and people still continue to use it. And as we've seen in other markets, there are imperfect benchmarks that exist in the world and we can all talk about how we could design a more perfect one, but the market tends to try to just continue to evolve and adapt around the imperfect ones and as opposed to abandon them. And so we -- that's really what we see going on here. And we've had a lot of dialogue with our customers about the potential to launch new delivery points or new contract designs or new specifications. Obviously, that's why we're changing our gas oil contract from a High Sulfur Gasoil, which is really heating oil to Low Sulphur Gasoil, which is really diesel fuel. And so, we do, do those kinds of things, but what's interesting, if you look at what we announced is that the market told us, don't launch a new gas oil contract, just change the one that we have now from high sulfur to low sulfur, so that things can continue and it's that kind of attitude that we're seeing by energy traders in the U.S. natural gas base. Operator : Our next question is from Alex Kramm of UBS. Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : I want to start with coming back to expenses, but maybe ask a little bit more vague longer-term question. I think, historically, ICE has done a really great job of cutting expenses and discretionary expenses when you have lower volumes. If I look at your, I think, your proxy right now, for example, I think a lot of management compensation is also going to be tight. Your synergy realization at the same time, those have a much bigger organization that's now doing things like listings in other parts. So as you look at this current environment and the volume environment, if that persists, but you do well on other things like [indiscernible] you still have the kind of discretionary or that flexibility on the comp side as we approach the end of the year? Scott A. Hill: 100%. Yes, we are a performance-based pay company and we remain a performance-based compensation company. So that flexibility will absolute exist. I think we've been pretty explicit. Look, we understand that there's a lot of noise in putting these 2 companies together, and we're trying to be very explicit, more explicit than -- we haven't given revenue guidance before and we gave you a number, we are trying to break our expense guidance down into pieces to be helpful, but if you look at that guidance, I mean, it's reflective of what would be a very good year. If we don't hit those numbers, our compensation will be adjusted accordingly across the board. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Alex, the biggest issue is that this particular management team that's sitting in this room on this call doesn't really want to run a big bureaucratic organization. We just -- it's not what we do well and none of us enjoy it and we enjoy feedback directly from customers. And you can only get that when you are running incredibly flat and you get the senior management dialoguing directly with employees that are touching customers day in and day out. So the culture here is just one where we don't want to be that and we don't like it. And as a result of that, we're not going to tolerate a lot of bureaucracy. Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay, great. And then, maybe secondly, just coming back to the European interest rate business for a second, I think you gave some highlights of new product launches, and things like that. But can you talk about other things that you've been -- maybe doing behind the scenes that maybe not be as obvious like obviously, I think you changed some market maker incentives? And then, Scott, does that actually help the pricing? And should that continue to help pricing? And then, but also, in terms of your sales organization or other things that you do when you interface with your customers, I mean, what are you doing different than maybe that Liffe did not do as well in the past? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: This is Jeff. Let me try to tackle that at a high level. First of all, the main thing that we're doing is we're pushing the Liffe and the ICE organizations together and we're taking the best people from those 2 organizations. At the same time, we're pushing the Liffe products onto the ICE trading platform because we have -- we think better distribution or lighter weight platform or platform that's easier to deploy, it's accessible via the Internet, and so we're doing a lot of technology work to really modify the traditional commodities-based ICE platform to handle a wide range of financial products, including some that are incredibly complex. We're also looking at our interest rate footprint as a global footprint, and we're combining our interest rate products in ways that will give economic offsets in clearing, but also, we'll be complementary to the way people trade and we're designing the platform usage to try to exploit that. And in that regard, when it comes to pricing and market maker schemes and what have you, we basically are moving from the Liffe model to the historical ICE model. And just aligning, pricing and schemes and things to what we believe works for us and the comments I made about market structure for the equities market apply to our views on all of our markets and how we think about rebates and market maker schemes and payment for order flow and limiting high-frequency traders to those that have meritorious behavior. And all of those kinds of things are kind of built into our thinking and are built into the ICE platform and so there's a lot going on right now around those products. It represents a huge opportunity for us, so we're quite focused on it. While I spent a large portion of my prepared remarks talking about the U.S. equity structure, that's largely because it's in the news. The reality is, as you know, it's not a particularly large business for us and we have incredible flexibility to try to make some changes to that business, because we have the opportunity of scale. And so we speak with one voice here and I think that's how you're going to see us operate in the interest rate complex, which I think is materially different than some of our peers and I think it will be well-received, frankly. Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Yes, So Scott, then anything on the pricing on the interest rates you want to call out? Scott A. Hill: No. Again, I think it had not a particularly material impact on the pricing overall and you have seen it to continue to expect pricing similar to other proxies, reasonably stable. Operator : Our next question is from Niamh Alexander of KBW. Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : If I talk about the cash, you suggest so -- such a great track record with the cash earnings consistently kind of exceeding the operating earnings and the returns on the capital. Now I see you're kind of upping the CapEx guidance here and then going to the bottom of Slide 21, you seem to be investing in a new matching engine for U.S. engines. I guess I'm a little concerned because your predecessors, NYSE, have historically -- we've kind of examined the organization, as we used to cover them, we always covered ICE. I mean, it was such a story of contrast and you're kind of minimizing the CapEx and maximizing your returns and still having minimum downtime, whereas New York kind of was constantly throwing cash into its systems and reinventing the systems and still having kind of very low margins. So I'm a little nervous that you're raising the CapEx guidance here and you seem to be investing in, yet again, another engine for U.S. equities and options, and that's been done by them for several years. So just help me reconcile the two? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Neve, this is Jeff. Let me start. What we decided to do at -- in the cash equities and equity options business is to standardize on one lightweight, easily deployable and high-capacity platform. What the past management inherited at NYSE were 5 different exchanges that have 5 different platforms and they spent a significant amount of time and energy to get those platforms to work together as a single cohesive unit and they should be credited for that because they're 5 disparate systems. What we want to do now is just really take that to the next level, which is replace all of that with a single platform because the differences between market structures in those businesses are not great enough to warrant having different platforms. But there are, frankly, there are different features between different regulatory exchanges, largely revolve around maker-taker pricing and the way market makers are compensated. And again, owing to our earlier comments, we want to standardize that. We want to simplify that. We want to have a single, fast, lightweight platform that is reliable and so we're making a one-time investment. What will come out of that and we think is a great return on invested capital because we're going to so dramatically simplify things that will be able to shed a lot of excess complexity and things that add to decreasing reliability by the incumbent system. We've got that kind of DNA inside ICE. We started the company at the height of the Dotcom boom. We really believe in embracing low-cost hardware that is easily deployable and that has a lot of redundancy in its networking design. And so we're bringing that kind of mindset to this new product. Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : Okay, fair enough. And just, I guess, for my follow-up, on Euronext, can you walk me through your interest or desire to have to -- what scenario will you still be consolidating Euronext? I'm just trying to get a sense, I guess, basically of, if there's enough demand, would you be interested in kind of no longer consolidating or no longer having a controlling interest in the organization, if there's enough demand and if the structure allows that? Scott A. Hill: Yes, Neve, that -- whether we consolidate or not, it is pretty straightforward accounting. If we've got more than 50%, we'll consolidate it, if it's less than 50%, we won't. Clearly, we said early days that we didn't think we were the optimal owner of what is an attractive business. But it's a business that serves local markets and we didn't bring much to the table. And so there's no particular goal on our side to own a majority and to consolidate the results. What we're going to be able to sell at the time of the IPO that I mentioned earlier is going to depend on what the market dynamics are, but we don't have any desire to continue to consolidate the business for any long-term period. Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : So is this valuation -- are there certain valuation levels you'll be willing to sell more, but it pays you more to kind of keep it? Scott A. Hill: Yes, that's exactly right. Sorry to step on your question, but when we are -- as we talk about market dynamics, price, demand, all of those factor in. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Neve, I think -- Jeff -- this is Jeff. I think, we're -- it's going to be one of those situations where shortly before we take the business to the public markets, we're going to look at the markets and look in the mirror and talk to our advisers and try to make the best decision on behalf of our shareholders, of what is the immediate benefit of exiting versus what is the longer-term economic benefit of keeping and what will the market allow us to do and we're just going to stick our finger in the wind and try to make the most informed decision that we can at that moment in time. So we're prepared for any eventuality. I mean, fortunately, Scott has done a very good job with the debt that we've been able to secure that gives us a lot of flexibility. And as you can see, we're generating a lot of cash that allows us to service that debt. So we have a lot of flexibility in looking at that market as we move into the IPO. Operator : Our next question is from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Sorry, another one on expenses, but given the reaction from investors, I think, today, it's clear that it's still kind of a concern out there. But maybe if you look at the guidance for the ICE segment on the operating basis, and somebody else talked a little bit earlier about your ability, historically, to kind of deliver operating leverage on the positive side even in a tough revenue environment. So within the $1.56 billion to $1.58 billion, Scott, can you give us a sense of what kind of volume or revenue backdrop you anticipate embedded in that expense guidance? Scott A. Hill: Yes, look, I think people saw a headline that expense guidance was up and the stock is up on that, but to me, that's a buying uptick, because we didn't say anything different, right? What we said about expenses is 100% consistent with what I said in February with one exception, and that's that we're going to add expenses related to Euronext, predominately related to the clearing arrangement that started on April 1. We said our margins will be 48% to 49% with that Euronext and NYXT, they were more than 50%. All the expense guidance due for the year, again, on revenues that similar to what we saw in the first quarter, it's 50%. The expense in the first quarter reflects a run rate of over $220 million of synergies, more than 40% is already done. That's what we said in February, it's true. We said there will be some investments, as we go through the year, some additional synergies as we go through the year and we said we'd grow revenue. In the first quarter, we grew revenue of 4%. So again, we'll go look at whether or not maybe there's some lack of clarity in the guidance, but it is very consistent. It is very positive and it's right on track with where we expect to be. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then speaking of the stock and the buying opportunity, I guess, you guys have said in the past that it's frustrating that your hands are kind of tied, that you can't take advantage of buying back stock here. Now assuming that the divestitures kind of take place as you would expect, but also understanding that there's a Eurobond that you would like to retire next year. Can you speak to your flexibility to perhaps pay down the commercial paper this year to kind of get the leverage ratio in the right place and start the buyback sooner? Scott A. Hill: Yes, so that's one of the reasons why we shifted a lot of it at the end of the commercial paper, that is easily repayable once we've got the cash in hand to do that. We are looking at the dynamics for an early payment on the Eurobond and what that would entail. We're in discussions with the ratings agencies on how they would treat it if we had the debt but we also satisfied cash. With that [indiscernible] net debt treatment, so that our leverage would be viewed at a point where you can say we can get back to executing on the authorized share repurchase that we have today. So I feel pretty confident that once we get through the Euronext IPO, with, as Jeff said, the strength in our operating cash flow, that we've got a very flexible debt structure that will allow us to get the deleveraging done efficiently. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Great. And just a clarification on the incremental revenues from the Euronext clearing arrangement that is anticipated to starting, I guess, April 1. Scott A. Hill: Yes, so again, the agreement started April 1. The net of the arrangement is there's some expenses that I mentioned, $9 million to $10 million, that would be incurred and revenues of $16 million to $17 million. Just to be clear, that's really based on looking at first quarter volumes and what with the revenues have been based on those volumes. And then assuming similar volumes in 2Q is what it would yield, but embedded in that, obviously, is that amount of revenues will be tied to the derivatives volume that is related to the clearing agreement. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo Securities. Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : So another follow-up question on the volumes. I appreciate all the color you guys have given regarding what's happening in the market, but one thing I'm just kind of thinking about is kind of the decline in the volumes that you've seen. They seem to kind of be correlating exactly with a pull back from the banks and others that are kind of closing their commodity trading desks or significantly reducing them and also the slowdown in Asia. So you guys have mentioned those things, but I was wondering if there -- are any of those having an impact on your volumes? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: This is Jeff. We don't really see that. I would -- at least, it's always hard to know why somebody trades, but honestly, it doesn't feel like that it's that correlated to the banks. The banks that we deal with, as I said in my prepared remarks, those that have separated themselves from some of their trading operations. Those trading operations have largely gone other places and continue to give us business and the banks still are facilitating a lot of customer business that they tend to have always done. The banks have never been a particularly large percentage of our commodity markets per se. And these are widely distributed markets that are global and it is interesting that we do still see growth coming out of Asia. That's why we want to own an exchange and clearing house in Singapore. And if you look at our energy business, amazingly, to me, our European energy business, what people think of as our historical European energy business, has less volume coming from the EU than it does from places outside the EU, as we sit here today. Its growth has been incredibly global and incredibly dispersed. So I think, U.S. natural gas was -- is really a weather-related issue. There are structural changes going on the gas market, but volumes, specifically tend to be somewhat volatility-related and gas oil we're changing the spec and so people are adjusting that. And the interest rate complex in the U.K. is waiting for the Bank of England and the U.K. economy, which we have cautious optimism has turned the corner and is improving and we'll start to put volatility in the rates business, so all those things feel like us -- like a spring that's coiled for upside, particularly when you lay over our open interest trends on it. And none of that has anything to do with the way banks are restructuring, in my mind. Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And a quick follow-up for Scott, just kind of a point of clarification. Again, sorry, Scott, on the synergies and expense guidance. So I know the expense guidance excludes NYXT. But one thing, I just want to make sure I'm getting right. The remaining synergies you guys have left, does that also exclude NYXT or are there expenses embedded in there related to NYXT as part of your synergies that are remaining? Scott A. Hill: Now that's a great question. So we had about -- of the $220 about $35 million to $40 million of that came from the NYXT business, which is now sitting in disc ops. Those businesses that we are divesting or have shut down or all in disc ops, as we go forward, I think the simplest way to think of it, is the rest of the synergies you're going to see show up in the ICE segment expenses. Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. So it all hit the P&L then? Scott A. Hill: Yes. Operator : And our next question is from Bill Katz of Citigroup. William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : As we think about the combination of ICE and New York Stock Exchange. I think one of the themes was that you might be able to get more expenses out of the business than you maybe have or articulated. So based on sales commentary, it sounds like you're going to spend a little bit first, but we're now at a point where the incremental synergies of the business might be more on the top line or could there still be some more incremental savings that you could see on the other side in 2015? Scott A. Hill: I think the opportunity exists for both. One of the key expense synergies that we're working on, it's not even really the integration, it's frankly, the merger of Liffe into ICE Futures Europe on 2 1 site. It's already sitting in 1 clearing house, but on 2 1 platform. And one of the things that we've seen historically, as we move more people onto a single platform, that tends to boost trading. You just get more people staring at the screen, more people who are able to trade, et cetera. And so I definitely think that there are synergy opportunities on the top line related to that, setting aside that the opportunity that exists as the European economy tends to -- starts to improve or continues to improve and we continue to launch new products. So I definitely think there are top line opportunities. And look, I think you said it exactly right. One of the reasons that we're making the investment that Jeff described earlier in the NYSE Technology platform is because we believe a simple, elegant, single technology platform would be much less costly to maintain than 5 separate technology platforms. And so I do anticipate that we will continue to find expense synergy opportunities. I'm not saying that 500 is more today, but I'm saying there's an opportunity for 500 to be more and I think as a management team, we've demonstrated a very good ability to get expense out where those opportunities have existed. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: And maybe I should mention, this is Jeff. We're well along on how we're going to move to a more simple technology model inside NYSE and the related exchanges and we have a competitor that is going to be moving people on the new platforms and so we're looking at when we can move and the timing around that, so that we don't put the industry through too much stress. But we are making rapid progress that will allow us to both cut costs and simplify and grow that business. We believe that, I think it would be meaningful in the not-too-distant future, given the speed that we've been working. We didn't announce it, but we've been -- we've respectively been working on that platform since the first day that we acquired the company and things are going well in terms of how we've been able to organize and get ready to deploy that. William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. So then my follow-up question comes back to market structure. And Jeff, I appreciate your comments. As you think about everything you've mentioned, it seems like there's pros and cons for both the industry, as well as ICE. How should we think about the forgone revenue or economics that might come about from some of these promulgated changes. Obviously, [indiscernible] have to get versus the opportunity for maybe some consolidation of fragmentation? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Well, I think to a certain degree, the exchanges are somewhat responsible for the fragmentation of the market by what was perceived as innovation with all these new order types and rates. And to me, it's not completely surprising that people wanted to flee those markets and trade elsewhere. Today, you have in the United States about 40% of the business that is not trading on exchanges and that's quite sad and it's definitely impacting in less liquid names. The price discovery process, you've got conversation about whether or not we should move to $0.05 pick sizes, whether we should do other kinds of stimulations to try to bring people back to some of the more illiquid names and the reality is, I think the easiest way to bring people back to transparent markets are to make it easy for them and simple for them to access those markets. And so, I think, whatever we would give up in some of the \"innovative things\" that we have at our exchange, we would more than make up in volume. Beyond that, what's saddening about the U.S. equity market is that when I go out and talk to my friends, they do not have confidence in those markets and that is a -- trying to take a bigger piece of a shrinking pie is a silly business, and we should all be trying in this industry to grow that pie. And yes, we can bang each other's heads and compete for pieces of pie, but the reality is, if you look at the quality of people that are writing algorithms, these people are literally some of the smartest people in the world and we, as an industry, have been deployed on trying to get pieces of a shrinking pie and it's just from a societal standpoint, it seems like a misallocation of resources. So I'm quite confident that we can simplify the model, make it easy to access, that it will grow because the markets were up over 30% last year in the United States and who wouldn't want to be 30% richer in their liquid net worth today? And if our entire U.S. pension obligation were levered against a 30% increase, we would be in a substantially better place than we are today for our retirees. So I think that, that thing can grow. But it's got to become simpler and easier to access and I think The New York Stock Exchange, as I said before, will get more than its fair share of the business. Until we get there, what we're seeing us do is investing and making it simpler, easier, smaller and less complicated and that is something that we control, and that's what we're doing and the small investment that we're making in that platform, we believe, will have, as I said, a very high return on invested capital as we simplify those companies. Operator : Our next question and our last question today is a follow-up from Alex Kramm of UBS. Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Guys, real quick. Since you legally separated ICE and Euronext, do you -- can you actually already give us the kind of net debt balance that Euronext is going to be carrying? I don't think it's in the Q. Scott A. Hill: No, it's not in the Q. It's not publicly available. Sorry, but just to be clear, what we've legally separated was Liffe out of Euronext, not Euronext from ICE. So it's not a separate company yet. Although, its management team quite successfully ran the first quarter in a very independent manner. Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. And then, just maybe secondly, and sorry to come back to the U.S. equities market structure, but Jeff, I think you said that you have a lot of ideas, a lot of things that you think should change in equity market structure. But it sounds like to some degree, you also acknowledge that it's different to drive change because volumes would just go somewhere else and you would lose market share, but to one degree, I would say, you have 3 markets if you run in equities today and one of those markets EMEX or MKT, whatever it's called to these days is obviously doesn't have much market share. So why don't you start experimenting? Like why don't you try to drive some of these changes that you think should be right in some of those markets and then go out there and talk to customers to acknowledge them? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: First of all, I'm smiling because you think about the name of that business in the same way I do, which is I don't understand it. It doesn't have a lot of brand equity and it's something that they were talking about. But beyond that, we never talk about the things that we're doing behind the scenes. We'll roll out our businesses when we think it's appropriate, but you can rest assure that we're looking for opportunities, talking to a lot of people and looking at the assets that we have in much of which in the way you're thinking about it. And what I wanted to talk about on the call today, were the things that the industry should be doing, but I don't necessarily want to preview the things that we're doing. Operator : And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeffrey Sprecher for any closing remarks. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Thanks, Emily. I want to thank all of you for joining us on today's call, and we're continuing to move a lot of parts and pieces and advance our business, and we'll continue to upgrade -- update you on that progress on these initiatives as we move through the quarter. And thanks again for your participation today. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kelly Loeffler, Senior Vice President. Please go ahead. Kelly L. Loeffler: Good morning. ICE's second quarter 2014 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of our website at theice.com. These items will be archived, and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2013 Form 10-K. In addition to GAAP results, we've also referred to certain non-GAAP measures, including adjusted operating results from continuing operations, adjusted net income and EPS from continuing operations. These measures adjust GAAP results for certain extraordinary items, including the NYSE acquisition and discontinued operations, and, we believe, are more reflective of the core business performance than GAAP results. You'll find the non-GAAP reconciliation in the earnings release and presentation, an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful and how management uses these measures. Net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses. With us on the call are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Chuck Vice, President and Chief Operating Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Scott. Scott A. Hill: Thank you, Kelly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4, where I'll provide a summary of our first half performance. Despite the continued headwinds of low volatility, which resulted in futures volumes declining 19% in the first half, ICE's consolidated net revenues of $1.5 billion were basically flat year-on-year on a pro forma basis. We expanded adjusted operating margins to 50%, and we grew adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations 2% to $4.38 per share. In addition, during June, we completed the IPO of Euronext and used those proceeds to effectively reduce our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA leverage to our target of 1.5x. We also reached agreements to sell the nonstrategic NYSE Technologies businesses. Then, moving into July, we repurchased 1.8 million shares of our stock for $350 million. And finally, we continue to make good progress on our integration plan, including the successful transition of the Liffe US contracts onto our ICE Futures exchanges. Our improved full year guidance now reflects the achievement of nearly half of our original $500 million synergy target, and we have increased that target to $550 million to reflect additional synergies related to our cash equity and equity options businesses. Our ability to grow earnings in the first half against the backdrop of declining volume is driven by many factors, including a favorable mix of products, diversification across our global markets, continuous product development and our disciplined focus on expense management. Importantly, there remain numerous metrics, from rising open interest levels to customer log-ins, that indicate volume declines are cyclical rather than structural. Open interest across our asset classes grew 5% from the end of 2013, and we established several volume records despite the overall low volatility environment. Please turn to Slide 5, where I will briefly discuss our second quarter results. Consolidated net revenues were $750 million. Adjusted operating expenses were $387 million, and our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 48%. We also received $15 million in dividends from Cetip in the second quarter, which are reflected in other income. This includes an $11 million annual dividend and $4 million in quarterly interest and dividend payments, reflecting an increased payout ratio and a shift to quarterly versus annual dividend payments in 2014. This quarterly income is an important and recurring return on our investment and our partnership with Cetip. Our tax rate came in towards the higher end of our range at 29% as our business mix this year has shifted more towards the U.S. given the softer volumes in Europe. Adjusted net income attributable to ICE from continuing operations was $243 million, and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.10. For the first half of 2014, operating cash flow was $836 million, an increase of 1% versus the pro forma operating cash flows of the 2 companies in the prior 6 months, excluding discontinued operations. During the same period, investments in operational capital expenditures and capitalized software were $87 million. Now let's move to Slide 6, where we detail revenues and expenses for the second quarter. On the left side of the chart, you can see that over 60% of our $750 million in net revenue is made up of transaction and clearing net revenue, which totaled $460 million. Market data revenues were $96 million. This includes Liffe market data revenues, which declined about $6 million from the first quarter as we transitioned to separate data packages for Liffe and Euronext. We expect to recover at least half of that decline in the third quarter. Market data revenues for legacy ICE increased modestly, indicating continued strong interest in these markets. We also generated $83 million in revenue from listings. Excluding the purchase accounting adjustment, listings revenue would have been up 5% year-to-year. Other revenue contributed $111 million in the second quarter. The right side of Slide 6 shows our expense detail. Second quarter adjusted expenses were $387 million and came in below our guidance primarily due to a $6 million R&D state tax credit reflected in compensation expense, which relates to 2012 and '13. While future credits and the timing of such credits depend on the continuing extension of federal R&D tax credits, we expect to receive a recurring benefit for the current and future years. Adjusting for this benefit in the quarter, we would have come in at the low end of the range of our expense guidance. And importantly, adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 48%, reflecting the benefit of the more than $200 million in synergies we've already realized. Moving now to Slide 7. I'll discuss our derivatives revenue and volumes in greater detail. Total futures and options revenue was $329 million on volume that declined 20% year-to-year, reflecting low volatility across most asset classes. This includes European interest rates that declined significantly compared to 2013 volumes, which grew 25%, and against the backdrop of recent ECB rate cuts that have kept short-term interest rates near 0 in the EU. Despite the decline in volumes, open interest trends are encouraging. Open interest was 79 million contracts at the end of the second quarter, a 5% increase from the end of 2013. Excluding natural gas, open interest was 58 million contracts at the end of the second quarter, up 17% from year end. Brent and other oil open interest are at record levels, up 25% and 17%, respectively, at the end of June compared to year end. And interest rates open interest is up 17% year-to-date. And as we've seen before, once volatility and seasonal activity returns, these types of healthy open interest levels generally translate into volume growth. We announced July volumes on Tuesday, and despite declining volumes in energy, our July energy revenues were up versus the prior year and up significantly from the second quarter of this year. This is a tangible example of the growth in Brent OI turning into a meaningful revenue contribution as volatility returns. And the slight RPC decline was due to the typical declines we see related to customer mix during volatile periods and remind us that it's revenue, not RPC, that generates profit. Continuing with our derivatives markets on Slide 8, I'll update you on our CDS business. CDS revenues were $41 million in the second quarter, up 3% year-to-year. This was driven by a 6% increase in clearing revenues to $24 million. In the first half of 2014, we continued to enhance our product set, including clearing for the market iTraxx Senior Financial CDS Index and sovereign CDS instruments on Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ireland. In the course of just a few months, we've cleared $537 billion in gross notional value in these new contracts. Turning next to Slide 9. You will see a summary of the second quarter performance of our U.S. cash equities and U.S. options exchanges. While second quarter volumes in cash equities were down 12% year-to-year, we achieved market share gains both year-on-year and sequentially. And as you will hear from Jeff, we continue to focus on a constructive dialogue with our industry and regulators to reduce market complexity. In our U.S. options business, we also saw muted volumes, resulting in average daily volume declining 21%. Though market share was down year-over-year, market share and RPC were steady sequentially. And as reported on Tuesday, our July volumes were mixed, with U.S. cash equities average daily volume of 1.3 billion down 4% year-over-year but with U.S. equity options average daily volume of 3.6 million rising by 1% year-over-year. Next, on Slide 10, we provide an overview of our cash generation and debt profile. Operating cash flows grew to $836 million during the first half. At June 30, we had $2.1 billion in unrestricted cash. On a trailing 12-month basis, our cash earnings per share were $9.64, which is a 6% increase in cash earnings over the same period in 2013. We calculate cash EPS using operating cash flow less capital expenditures, divided by the weighted average shares outstanding. We believe this is an important metric for investors to consider as it reflects the cash-generative capability of our business. We completed the IPO of Euronext in June and received total net proceeds of $1.9 billion. Following the receipt of the proceeds, we set aside $1.3 billion to repay the June 2015 euro notes when they mature. In addition, the proceeds were also used to reduce our outstanding commercial paper by $563 million during the quarter. As a result, adjusted gross debt-to-EBITDA is 1.5x. Our target debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of 1.5x will remain an important focus. However, you'll see us moving around that target from time to time based on the cash flow of the business, the timing of strategic investment opportunities and our capital return program. Please now move to Slide 11, where I'll provide an update on our capital allocation. We remain focused on driving both earnings growth and delivering strong returns by investing in our business while also providing a prudent level of capital return to shareholders, both through dividends and share buybacks. As you can see on Slide 11, capital returns were modest in 2012 and 2013 as we prepared to close the NYX transaction. However, prior to that, from 2008 to 2011, we repurchased nearly $600 million of our common stock. And in July, after using Euronext proceeds to achieve our leverage target, we spent $350 million to repurchase 1.8 million shares of our common stock under our existing $450 million share repurchase plan. And our Board of Directors recently expanded our share repurchase authorization by an additional $600 million. As the chart indicates, based upon our current dividend level and assuming we utilize the remaining $700 million for future share repurchases by the end of 2015, we may return as much as $1.7 billion to shareholders during 2014 and '15 combined, including over $1.1 billion in the next 17 months. Importantly, we believe we can do this while continuing to invest in our existing business and while participating in strategic M&A to drive long-term growth. I'll wrap up on Slides 12 and 13. Slide 12 shows the evolution of our expense base and synergy achievement. The chart begins with the data we provided when we announced the NYSE acquisition in December 2012 and includes adjustments to remove Euronext and NYSE Technologies from the expense base. Importantly, as noted on the first bullet of this slide, after a comprehensive review of the NYSE operations, we have identified an additional $50 million of expense synergies. This includes the technology platform rationalization we discussed last quarter, as well as efficiency gains across other areas of the business. The increased total of $550 million in expense synergies exiting 2016 means we will have reduced the combined company's total expense base by roughly 30% and the NYSE Liffe expense base by well over 40%. Moving to the graph, you will recall that in our November strategic and financial update, we noted $95 million in expense synergies had already been achieved. We subsequently noted that we would achieve between $35 million and $40 million of synergies from the discontinued NYSE Technologies businesses. Adding those 2 together, you get $132 million of synergies achieved and a continuing ops expense base of just over $1.6 billion. Our current full year expense guidance reflects an additional $108 million in synergies versus that new base, bringing the total to $240 million in 2014. And as we exit this year, our first quarter 2015 expenses should reflect a run rate to achieve 70% or $350 million of our original synergies, excluding any additional investments we may make during 2015. You can see that as the synergies increase and as we divest nonstrategic businesses, our total expense base comes down significantly. You can also see this progress in our operating margin, which, as noted previously, was 50% for the first half of 2014. Turning quickly to Slide 13. I'll point out our updated guidance for the third quarter and full year. All guidance completely excludes Euronext and the to-be-sold NYSE Technology businesses. You'll note improvement in virtually every element of our expense guidance. Importantly, you'll also note that D&A is 2x larger than operational CapEx, which is another important factor when considering the cash generation of our business. I'll be happy to answer any questions about our guidance or any other topics during Q&A. For now, though, I'll hand the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Thank you, Scott. Good morning to those on the call. Since completing our acquisition of NYSE, we've moved quickly to achieve the objectives we established when we announced our transaction. With many of the strategic changes implemented, we've provided guidance related to our business model post Euronext. We're working to innovate for our customers amid a time of tremendous change in the industry, and we continue to drive improvements in market structure in each of the asset classes we serve. Through new products and services being introduced, we're well positioned for the return to a more normalized volatility levels over time. Periods of change are when ICE excels, and throughout our history, we've developed risk management tools and infrastructure that reduces friction in markets and creates efficiencies. In short, we're focused on these objectives to grow and to lead. While specifics around regulation around the world may diverge, the common theme is that trading and risk management continue to move on exchange and into clearinghouses. Therefore, we're taking our cues from the opportunities that come from this trend rather than from the current period of low volatility. As you can see on Slide 14, we have continuously evolved ICE to lead global financial markets into the future. With our humble beginnings as an OTC energy market, today we operate 11 exchanges, covering 9 asset classes, and have 5 clearinghouses. And we're preparing to expand with the relaunch of ICE Futures Singapore and ICE Clear Singapore in the coming months. With our acquisition of NYSE and Liffe, our markets now include some of the largest markets for interest rates, cash equities, equity options and global commodities. And despite competitors with aggressive payment for order flow programs in our flagship products, our markets remain the venue of choice for risk management due to our breadth of products, liquidity, capital efficiency and our focus on designing our products around our customer requirements. We've built infrastructure to extend deeper into risk management and workflow activities. We launched ICE Benchmark Administration, which now oversees both LIBOR and ISDAFIX to rebuild confidence in these vital benchmarks. And with the demand for automation, we developed the compliance and workflow tools such as ICE Trade Vault and ICE Link. So taken together, the value of integrated trading, clearing, data and post-trade services offers value beyond trade matching, which is why our adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations declined just 4% in the quarter amid double-digit volume declines. I'll walk through some of our volume trends, which you can see starting on Slide 15. In addition to the secular trends that produced annual growth in ICE's Brent crude volume, recent geopolitical unrest has also driven volumes. In June, ICE Brent ADV increased 18% year-on-year, and open interest reached a record all-time high. As we reported this week, Brent volume in July grew 26% year-to-year to 827,000 contracts per day. So you can see we started the third quarter above our 2013 level of 700,000 contracts per day. Longer term, we believe the growth trend is solid due to our Brent Crude Oil benchmark's global relevance and the capital efficiencies across our oil complex of more than 400 related futures contracts. Moving to Slide 16. You can see North American natural gas volumes remain depressed, but open interest remained significantly above precrisis levels. The North American natural gas market continues to transform as it adjusts to the new shale supply. The market is still working through how the additional supply will be stored, transported, exported and consumed. Such infrastructure takes time to come online, so this is a multiyear shift in reshaping the U.S. natural gas markets. This also means that natural gas markets will likely globalize as projects and regulation to manage LNG transportation and export come online in the next few years. In the meantime, low prices are driving increased consumption as energy producers increasingly switch from coal and propane to natural gas. The right hand of the chart is our European natural gas futures volume, which is traded on ICE Endex and includes our U.K. and continental European natural gas hubs. Again, in the second quarter, volume more than doubled year-to-year and open interest continued to grow as customers seek efficiency and liquidity of exchange-traded markets. Historically, the European natural gas markets have been a bilateral over-the-counter market, but over time, this business has begun to migrate on exchange. Now if you move to Slide 17, you can see a solid base of volume in our financial futures and options markets. Low interest rates across most of the Eurozone are impacting our euro-denominated Euribor futures volume, which is also up against tough comparisons due to strong rates activity in last year's second quarter. This is somewhat offset, however, by solid performance in our U.K. sterling futures and options contracts, where volume and open interest were up 27% and 67%, respectively, year-on-year in the second quarter due to the changing expectations for U.K. interest rates. Open interest across our European interest rate futures complex is up 17% from the start of this year. In addition, with equity markets getting slightly more active, particularly in the non-U.S. products, we saw equities derivatives business expand year-to-year, with solid performance in our MSCI and Russell Index futures contracts. I'd like to highlight our global listings business on Slide 18, where The New York Stock Exchange continues to lead in capital raising during 2014, including in technology IPOs. NYSE's IPO issuance in the first half of the year is trending above the 2013 record pace. It's up across all metrics, and it's up 38% in the number of transactions. The first half momentum has continued through July and into August with 14 IPOs raising $7.5 billion in just those 5 weeks. Year-to-date, over $28 billion has been raised in 82 transactions, and that has created $140 billion in new market capitalization. In addition, 26 companies have listed a spin-out or a carve-out business on the NYSE, with more than a dozen yet to come in the balance of the year. I've had the honor to meet many entrepreneurs and business leaders coming through our building, and these IPOs are great moments in a company's history and are supporting overall economic growth. We continue to take a leadership role to advocate on behalf of our listed companies about the importance of an improved market structure. To that end, we unilaterally began reducing complexity and filed with the SEC last month to remove 12 order types and to harmonize all remaining order types at our 3 venues. Both NYSE President Tom Farley and I testified in front of Congress this summer to ensure the debate is balanced from an issuer perspective. Later this month, the SEC's plan for pilot programs relating to tick size and trade-at are expected to be announced, followed by their implementation to measure proposed solutions. We're working with the SEC and with our peers to ensure that we're taking positive steps to improve market structure and reduce the complexity that market participants are faced with today. Turning to Slide 19. I want to summarize our progress on our NYSE integration. However, before I begin, I want to make special mention of my counterpart, Duncan Niederauer, who led NYSE Euronext for 7 years through significant change and transformation in our industry. As he transitions from the NYSE at the end of this month, I want to thank Duncan for his leadership and recognize his shared vision for the future of NYSE together with ICE. In addition, I'm grateful for his mentoring to Tom Farley over many months, who became the President of NYSE in June. On the slide, you can see that we've added some new accomplishments to the checklist on our call in May. We continue our customer-centric growth with new products and expanding our global roster of listed companies. We finalized what was a very complex reorganization to separate Euronext and Liffe and then completed the IPO of Euronext, which unlocks significant value ICE for shareholders. We migrated Liffe US to ICE, moving the GCF Repo, Eurodollar, MSCI and metals contracts to other ICE exchanges, eliminating both cost and complexity for our customers. You see we're on track to complete the sale of our Technologies business in the quarter, and our Liffe U.K. integration is progressing very well. Our work to integrate multiple trading platforms for the U.S. cash equities and equity options exchanges is underway, and we've laid out for you the additional synergies available as a result of that and our continued work on the NYSE model. And we completed significant debt repayment and immediately began returning capital to shareholders, starting a repurchase program for our shares of stock. This morning, we also announced that we've acquired certain patents and related ongoing patent applications that relate to calculating and making trading decisions, under terms that will allow us to license this intellectual property to others. These patents have been the subject of prior litigation, which resulted in firms having to pay significant settlement fees. ICE decided to make this purchase to allow us to more broadly protect our customers when they make trading decisions that provide liquidity to ICE and NYSE markets. We're currently developing our own licensing plan, and we'll be contacting our customers in the coming months with more information. So as you can see, we're not waiting for volatility to return or for business to come to us. We're bringing back our customers new solutions needed to trade, manage risks and comply with regulations at a very dynamic time in our industry. By focusing on our customers' needs every day, we will grow. And in doing that, we will drive shareholder value. I want to thank our customers for trusting us with their business in the second quarter, and I want to thank our global team for delivering these results. And with that, I'll turn it over to Andrew, our operator, for the question-and-answer session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill. Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : The question's on Slide 11 and the capital return you outlined. So you can see the buyback of the $700 million over the next, what looks like, 5.5 quarters, until the end of 2015. And I think most would agree you're aggressive right out of the gate here. But looking at that $700 million, is that sort of written in stone? It looked -- it appears like it's about half the capability that we think you could buy back reasonably. If the stock stayed at these types of levels or lower, would you get more aggressive than the $700 million? Scott A. Hill: Yes. I mean, Rich, you touched on a number of important factors. How and when the buybacks flow will depend on market conditions. It depends on timing of our cash flow. It depends on where our leverage levels are. But our expectation, the reason we showed you the chart, is that over the -- between now and the end of 2015, we think it's likely that we will buy back the $700 million. We will continue to pay the dividend. And as I step back and think about a payout of $1.7 billion, which is what that total would be over the course of '14 and '15, or even the $1.15 billion that will be paid out over the next 17 months, I'll let you guys figure out what your 2015 estimate is. But you're going to calculate that out to somewhere around 60% to 70% payout. I think that's very strong. I think we've been very consistent in saying that we are going to leave some capital so that we can continue to invest in the business, so that we can remain flexible to expand through strategic M&A, where the return on investment is appropriate. So it's not ever been our intent to calculate how much cash we'll generate and to pay 100% of that out. In fact, I think that leaves you in a position that when the right opportunity does come along, you've got to use an expensive currency like stock to go make a deal as opposed to having the cash and the debt capacity to do it. Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : Understood. That's very helpful, Scott. And I guess my one follow-up, Jeff, is the volume picture right now, the thing that is sort of impacting numbers is what's going on with the European interest rate volumes. And I guess I just want to get your opinion on -- do you think this is what you call extended period, where -- it looks like Europe is just starting to go into -- or potentially going into the QE phase that we're coming out of, and you see a big divergence between short-term interest rate volumes in Europe and the U.S. Are we in for something that's -- the stagnant volume picture, how long do you expect it to last over there? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Well, I wish I had that crystal ball. It's very, very clear that the short-term interest rates are highly driven by central bank policy and that you've seen the U.S. central bank policy moving U.S. short-term rates. We've seen now the U.K. central bank moving U.K. short-term rates and our respective volume in trading. And I agree very much that our euro-denominated interest rate complex is highly sensitive to what the ECB will do with short-term rates, which is lagging those other 2 central banks. That being said, we saw the opportunity to acquire a fabulous rates franchise, one of the best in the world, at what we think are historic lows in volumes and hopefully, ride that trend back up to the benefit of our shareholders and our customers. And we are going to use that footprint there to expand what we do in the financial markets, so we do not intend to be wholly dependent on European central bank policy as we build out our franchise. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Maybe first, Jeff, more of a big-picture question. The U.S. is moving towards energy independence. What are the implications for ICE's energy trading volumes? In particular, for Brent, does shipping east versus west change the way Brent is hedged to the benefit or detriment of volumes? For WTI, is shale oil going to be benchmarked to TI or to another marker? And how does that impact your business, both in WTI and Brent? And then, in gas, we see the longer-term benefits to volumes and what's going on in gas, but is there anything in the near term in terms of implications of greater gas production and consumption that would benefit or further hurt gas volumes in the U.S.? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Well, that's quite a good question. Thank you. I think, first of all, obviously, the United States has a huge opportunity to become more energy independent in terms of its supply resources. But becoming energy independent does not mean that we become disconnected from the world's pricing of energy. What we're seeing, for example, is a big influx of natural gas-sensitive businesses into the U.S., particularly petrochemical businesses in the Gulf states, refining of oil in the Gulf states, whose goals and objectives will include export of their finished products out of the United States into a world market. Those exports and participation in global markets for LNG and refined oil products will ultimately drive the value of the raw material back home here. You're correct in that shale oil is not a particularly -- is not particularly well correlated to WTI. WTI is a pipeline-borne oil. And the shale oil, because of the transportation infrastructure, is moving by truck and other means and is making its way into the Gulf. And oddly, it's probably more highly correlated with Brent, which is a seaborne crude that happens to also come into the Gulf. As a result of that, I would expect that the market is either going to want to develop a Gulf Coast crude marker, or it's going to -- or that the WTI marker itself will be modified to include other grades of oil to make it more correlated to where oil may come in the future in the United States. Or we may continue to see it trade as -- shale oil trade as a differential to some combination thereof. But that oil complex is so highly correlated and related. Both the WTI and Brent benchmarks are very important, and that's why we want to trade both. And I think all of this movement will only be more positive for our volumes because it's massively expanding, it appears, the footprint of energy-dependent users that are going to want to hedge these global prices. We see that showing up in the requests for user IDs and passwords and the increased demand for the data that we sell around these markets. Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Great. And then just very simply, ICE launched a host of new interest rate products in Europe. They've yet to get meaningful traction. I know it's really early days. Is there any desire to get more aggressive here? And does central bank policy just make it harder for those to work, and is it just not the right time quite yet? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Well, you should know that the plan that we alluded to in our prepared remarks to integrate Liffe means that we intend to move all of the Liffe -- remaining Liffe European products onto a new matching engine and into a whole new installation that we've built using legacy ICE systems in Europe. And we've launched these new products on the old Liffe matching engine. And we have been telling our customers that that old system is going to be abandoned, and we have been working with that customer base to connect to the new system and to -- and they are actively doing testing right now and getting ready for a new launch. So to a certain degree, we launched those products because we wanted to be in the market, but they are severely handicapped by the way we've done it. And we would expect, really, our push into these markets to be contemporaneous with being on a more widely distributed and faster and more reliable platform that we have in the ICE matching engine. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Scott, just on the synergies and the expense outlook, just given the volume backdrop, I guess it's slightly difficult to kind of parse the synergies related to the deal and then just the core expenses given the revenue or the volume backdrop. But I just wanted to get your thoughts on how much flexibility or variability do you have in the model if some of these sluggish volumes, whether it's in nat gas rates, continue for some time? Scott A. Hill: Yes, it's a good question. A couple of thoughts. So first of all, I think you got to remember that we do have a pay-for-performance culture. And as you've seen over the past couple of years, to the extent our results come in below where our expectations are, we've adjusted our compensation accordingly. I think if you look at the trend through the first 6 months, we're a little bit behind where we'd need to be to get to those objectives. As we monitor the second half of the year, if that doesn't start to recover, you'll likely see, just as you have the past couple of years, an adjustment on that level. And as you've seen in the past, that's not an unmeaningful adjustment. And again, I think it aligns our team and our shareholders because the pay is aligned with performance. And the second related thought is, and we said this a couple of different ways in the prepared remarks, is we do think this is a cyclical issue and not a structural one. And so what we don't want to do is overreact and start to cut off investments in things like ICE Benchmark or Singapore or Cetip, where we believe those are the future additional growth drivers that we're going to see. That notwithstanding, if the volumes remain soft for an extended period, we can look at dialing back a little bit on some of those investments. And then at the end of the day, if it does become more sustained, I look at it as we have a $1.5 billion expense base in over 3,000 resources, there's absolutely opportunity to get more efficient in that environment. Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And then quick follow-up just on the capital management or cash deployment. When you think about 2015 and even longer, like how should we think about, like, the dividend level versus increasing the dividend as earnings grow? I mean, is that the strategy, like a certain payout, or will you be steady state and focus on buybacks in the near term? Scott A. Hill: Yes, that's the conversation that Jeff and I have and have had with our board and will continue to have to really look at -- I think embedded in your question is what's the optimal way to return cash to shareholders. As I've said a number of times, I think the great thing about the cash-generative ability of this business is we can return meaningful capital to shareholders and invest in the business and continue to do strategic M&A, so we don't have to pick one or the other. As we think about the capital return to shareholders, the mix of dividend versus share buyback really is going to depend on market conditions, on tax policy, on a number of factors. As we sit here today, I wouldn't expect a big change in the balance. The focus is, as is indicated on the chart, is on share buyback. But I wouldn't predict in '16, '17, '18, as you get out in time, I don't know what's going to be optimal at those periods, but we are committed to a meaningful share -- capital return to our shareholders. Operator : The next question comes from Neve Alexander of KBW. Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : If I could touch on credit derivatives, you had some nice revenue there. You've really seen that kind of re-base of the tiering as more of the Europe came onboard. But we're still a couple of years out of kind of regulation being fully implemented over there for the trading and the clearing. So can you give me an update on where you are now versus maybe where you think you can get to? And then what's going on with a futures product? Scott A. Hill: Yes, I'll touch on the first part, Neve. So as I kind of mentioned entering the year, we were very encouraged by what we saw in our January CDS clearing results because we were seeing meaningful uptake from the buy side. We were actually even seeing meaningful uptake from some European customers in those results, and that trend's really continued. Second quarter dialed back a little bit from the first quarter, but as you know, there is an index roll in March, so the first quarter tends to be above the second quarter anyway. But as I look at where we are for the first half, we're trending right towards where I thought we'd be, which is probably around $90 million of revenue or so this year. That's 15% more than what we had last year, and that was 30% more than we had the year before that. So I think the trend is right. And I think you touched on an important point, which is we still don't have a mandate for European buy-side clearing. There's still a number of products. I talked about some of the products that we rolled out on sov, which adds to Turkey, and a number of others that we've done. So there's still a meaningful opportunity for more products. The European client isn't even mandated yet, and we continue to see growing interest from clients here in the U.S. So I'm not going to give you a number other than to say it was $60 million, then it was $80 million, and now it's on its way to $90 million, and I think the trend is up. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: And Neve, this is Jeff. With respect to the futures product, I think you are aware that we tried and failed to launch a futures product, and so we've gone back to the drawing board to figure out why we failed and what we can do to make a relaunch more successful. And it's really two things. One, we're redesigning the product, and that's largely complete. We've had huge amounts of customer consultation to get input into exactly what the market thinks would work. And secondly, we're really waiting for the timing, and it was somewhat implicit in your question, which is we're looking to launch a true futures contract, in other words, a 2-way bid/offer, continuously traded, completely transparent, highly liquid contract. This is not a swap future. We already have a dominant position in the swaps market, as you know. So the question is will the market want to transition fully to a completely transparent liquid, 2-way bid/offer market. And we believe the market wants to do that. People are interested in that. And the question is what is the timing, and it will largely be driven by the need to get -- to move forward due to regulation and Basel rules kicking in. That all being said, we think that, that launch is probably this year still and that the market will support a launch later this year as people are starting to think about 2015 and 2016 organization of their trading activities. Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : Okay. Appreciate the update. And for my follow-up, if I could just come back on the capital distribution. Just because you have such powerful cash earnings and you have been acquisitive [indiscernible], even before the NYSE deal, with smaller ones that you can kind of fund as well. But if you don't come across some deals or some M&A, is there additional capacity over and above kind of the guided $750 million of potential share repurchases, like if you don't come across some deal opportunities? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: I think the way we approach M&A is we always look at will it meet our return on invested capital thresholds. And actually, that's historically how we looked at buying shares of ICE, and we loved having the opportunity in the past to buy on dips. So I think to the extent we have excess cash here, we'll be thinking what is the best and highest use for shareholder value and where can we deploy that, either through our own share buybacks or possibly some other person's share acquisitions. But the point there being that we will deploy that capital for high shareholder returns. I don't think we're going to be hoarding it, if you will. Scott A. Hill: And just, I mean, 2 metrics you guys may be interested in. The payout ratios in our industry average around 60% to 70%. And again, you do the math. I think that's what you're going to see we're talking about. In the S&P 500, something closer to 30%. So it's not an unmeaningful payout ratio that we're talking about. Operator : The next question comes from Alex Kramm of UBS. Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : I just want to come back to the volume picture, and I know it's been asked several times. And obviously, you proactively talked about the whole structural versus cyclical, and I agree with the cyclical side. But you're also very quick to point out the log-ins continue to go up and so forth, so very much appreciate it, but can you talk a little bit about the negative side? I mean, there are going to be -- there are some structural things that I'm sure you see and maybe some things you can even share, like has the market participation of certain members changed at all? In the energy side, something that we're hearing all the time is that there's no liquidity on the long end of the curve anymore. I know a lot of your trading is short end, but it's got to impact the market. So maybe give us a little bit of the negative things you see as well. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Sure. Look, there's no question that there's -- particularly, starting with commodities, where you targeted your question, there's definitely a change going on as assets are coming out of banks and people are coming out of banks. And we see those assets going to sort of a more highly identified new class of holder, which are these merchant energy companies. These companies have been customers of ours for a long time. We know their senior managements very well, have ongoing dialogue with them, but many of them are really now emerging as very large, significant players in the global commodity arena. And they are putting assets together. They are active hedgers. And what we've seen is open interest going up, and as soon as there's any hint of volatility in the market, there's just an amazing explosion of volumes. I mean, the kind of volatility that has driven our record Brent volumes, for example, has not been particularly huge. I mean, if you really look at the price of Brent, it's actually pretty amazing how with all the global conflict going on and given where the conflict is going on, that Brent's absolute price remains in a range that is reasonable to most of us as consumers. So it doesn't take a lot of volatility to really spike volumes for us, and that's because these assets and traders are sitting, waiting for volatility. We have also seen this trend where traders in Europe, for example, who are professional traders and are not seeing as much volatility in Europe, are coming cross-border, and they're looking for volatility. So we see people moving from their traditional asset class into other asset classes as they seek volatility to trade. And I see that trend in our own markets. I can see it in subcontext in some of our competitors' numbers as well. But again, that says that these people are there. They're ready. They're poised for when their traditional markets come back. They're not leaving the market. That's why we keep getting this sense that this is -- while there are some structural changes that are going on in terms of volume capability of the market to use risk management services that we provide, it's sitting there, ready to go. And that's why we continue to build out a product suite for those people. Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Great, that's helpful. And then, I guess, staying on the volumes, and I know someone already asked about the interest rate business, and I think you talked about, obviously, the ECB action or nonaction, whatever you want to call it, but is there anything else you'll be looking for to maybe accelerate the business, either because of new products? But also, is there any -- when you talk to traders, is there a sense that maybe, in a couple of months, even if we stay in this environment, the market normalize and some volumes that might be depressed right now are coming back, or even, let's say, if the U.S. or the U.K. is getting more active in terms of rate hikes that it actually impacts trading in ECB-related products as well? Or is it really wait until the ECB does something, in your opinion? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: It's a good question because when we talk to people in the markets, there is a sense of forbidding that it feels like something is going to happen, but no one can tell what. And I think broadly, as you read articles about the markets, that you see a lot more bearish sentiment coming in and people talking about -- that there are unintended consequences of global economic and central bank policy that are yet to be discovered. And when we talk to people, that's kind of the sense and a lot of traders trying to come to understanding of what -- where the next risk management issue may arise and positioning themselves for that, which is why I think open interest is going up. I mean, there is positioning going on that is anticipatory of some kind of change. It's not anticipation of flat-line central bank policy into the foreseeable future. It's setting up for an unintended consequence of that policy. Scott A. Hill: And I mean, to a large extent, we're setting up, too. The earlier question asked about the new products we launched, we're launching new products. We're building out clearing capabilities. We're building out our rates franchise generally. So while we can't necessarily do anything to make rates move right now, we're definitely not waiting or sitting on our hands. We're investing to build out the franchise so that when all the things Jeff just talked about start to flow through, we're well positioned with a very comprehensive rates offering. Operator : The next question comes from Kenneth Hill of Barclays. Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Research Division : First one I want to start with, I was hoping to get a little bit more of an update on the Benchmark Administration. You guys recently assumed some administrative roles for some of the ISDA benchmarks. You've got the LIBOR in there. So what's the kind of outlook for that? How do you guys think about monetizing some of those opportunities longer term? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Well, it's a good question. So we've been making significant progress on those businesses. We like those businesses because we're really starting -- we're starting with a nucleus that we think we can grow and build as opposed to acquiring mature benchmarks, which are trading at very, very significant valuations right now. What we've done so far is we started by moving LIBOR into our own auspices, and then just recently, we have now launched technology that will allow data gathering to come in and be more automated and auditable. We are still gathering the kind of data to create LIBOR that people have criticized. And the next step is to expand the way LIBOR is calculated to include more transactional data, correlated transactional data. And there is a process going on right now with an advisory group that is very, very broad and industry representative of what the next changes will be. But we needed to get the product moved over to ICE and then get the infrastructure in place, which it now is. So I think you will start to see the true evolution of LIBOR along the vein that the market is calling for. ISDAFIX has now moved over to us again. It's early days. We're just getting started. We intend, again, to gather transactional data to improve ISDAFIX. That means that we're going to be receiving data from a number of the MTF facilities there. We're working to automate the trade capture of that and analytics around that, that we'll use to publish ISDAFIX. With respect to the monetization of those things, we began a licensing program that we've rolled out. It's caught some people by surprise. It's interesting. There has been a lot of criticism by people that they wanted LIBOR to be better, but then when they're asked to pay for it, they're surprised. It shouldn't be a surprise. These are relatively modest licensing fees for major users of LIBOR. We've started that licensing program right now. We continue to take input from people. We're fine-tuning it. We're finding -- it's amazing how broad the use of LIBOR is in the world, so we're getting a lot of feedback from different kinds of users on how they use LIBOR, and that's informing our licensing practices, which we continue to evolve. So you'll see that. It's going to take multiple years for all that, I think, to roll out and start to bed itself, but that process has been started by us. Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. Appreciate all the color there. I guess my follow-up would be kind of another development area. You mentioned in your prepared remarks some of the upcoming ICE Clear Singapore launch. I'm kind of wondering what your outlook is for that, kind of what the customer feedback has been as you've been laying the seeds for that and how we should think about it going forward. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: It's great. I've been there a number of times myself to talk to customers, and we have people on the ground that are working every day in that regard. There's actually a lot of excitement around this launch, and I mean that genuinely. There are some very, very interesting risk management opportunities in Asia. There are geographical issues and tax issues and political issues that really drive the way those businesses work throughout the Asia region that certain types of contract designs may be able to solve and therefore, provide meaningful volume to us and meaningful risk management tools to the market. So there's a lot of input going in right now on opportunities, things that we have never thought of ourselves, never dreamed of but that our customers are bringing to us as tools that they would love for us to offer. We've got a very good team there. Now we've been building it out. We're putting our own people in place, working very, very closely with the regulator, going through with the regulator a litany of product offerings that we intend to launch and setting the stage for the regulatory approval of those things. So we'll have more to say about it as we move through the year, but progress is going well, and we're really, really fortunate to have that infrastructure there under our banner. Operator : The next question comes from Jillian Miller of BMO Capital Markets. Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Just wanted to get your thoughts on CME's acquisitions of Trayport. And from your perspective, does this impact your competitive positioning for energy in Europe? Specifically thinking, does this give CME some advantages, especially when going after new products that may be transitioning from OTC to more standardized futures, kind of like European nat gas? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Well, thanks for the question. First of all, whatever process the Board of Directors went through to sell that asset, we were not a part of it, so I really have not looked at that business particularly closely. We were not afforded the opportunity. But that being said, we've paid a lot of attention to comments that have come out around that acquisition and are confused, I would say, at best. We're hearing and have been told directly that the company is going to run as an independent autonomous unit, and that message -- and those drums seem to be being beat, but then -- and that is the message that's being delivered to us and other users of the platform. But then separately, shareholders are being told that it's highly strategic, that it's going to provide a lot of information and somehow inform how new futures contracts and clearing will be done by its owner. And those 2 things are in direct conflict. And so until we see what remedies are going to be put into place and how that business intends to be managed, it's very, very hard to answer your question. Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay, fair enough. And then just moving over to interest rates. You have launched a bunch of new products and moving forward with some of these benchmark administrations. And the one thing that we haven't heard a whole lot about is interest rate swap clearing. And I know, obviously, you've got a lot on your plate with the transition and technology changes going on, but I was just wondering what your plans are there. Is it still something that you guys are thinking about offering? And if so, like what's the timeline? When do you need to start working on that? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Well, we don't have anything to announce today, but I will tell you that we want to have a rates franchise, and we're looking at where are there parts of the market where we can do something that's incredibly innovative. We're not a company that just says, \"I'm going to launch another guy's product and pay for order flow.\" That's just not something that we've ever viewed as a market model. We like to figure out if there's something unique and novel that we can do that will really bring benefit to our customers. So we're having lots of conversations. I think, as was mentioned earlier in the call, the movement of the swaps business into clearing is taking probably longer than many have thought it would in terms of the regulatory mandates on how this is going to work right now. There is a large dialogue going on between global regulators about how global regulation of the swaps market is really intended to work and how information and oversight is going to be shared. And until there's a little more clarity as to how that's actually going to unfold, particularly between the U.S. and Europe, it's very, very hard to really get your arms around what a good OTC clearing franchise might even look like. We do think that those issues are on the table, they are under active conversation and that we'll have more visibility, I think, hopefully, by the end of this year. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Allen of Evercore. Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Most of my questions have been answered. I guess just one follow-up. I just want to follow up on kind of the expense outlook. Obviously, Scott, you noted the flexibility there as we kind of move to the back half of the year. You noted the first half top line was a little bit below expectations. Should we be thinking about, from a modeling perspective, modeling along the lines of your margin guidance for the year in terms of building in our expectations around the back half on the top line and then getting to that margin level? Is that kind of the right way to think about it? Scott A. Hill: Yes, I mean, because I always hesitate to guide to a margin in any particular quarter. What we've said is we kind of expect it to be 48%, 49%. We're tracking that through the half. I don't think that's an unrealistic expectation as you look at the year. I think as you think about modeling, the important is -- again, if we don't see the business start to recover a little bit, there will be an adjustment in compensation. I can't call that right now or I would have booked it in the second quarter. But it's clearly something that would be a reduction to that expense forecast. I'll note, though, that we would then restore that in 2015, so it's not a synergy because our expectation as we enter every year is we're going to meet our objectives and pay 100% of our bonus out. But as you're modeling second half, again, I think we've given you some pretty clear guidance on what we think the quarters are going to be. It doesn't include any adjustment in the bonus, but again, if the business doesn't start to recover, the pay-for-performance nature of our compensation will mean that you'll see comp come down. Operator : And the next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Jeff, a follow-up on the oil markets, and I think you alluded to that as well that given all the geopolitical unrest, it is a little surprising that we haven't seen more volatility in the oil space. Why do you guys think that is? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: It's hard to know. I think the market is becoming, unfortunately, used to political unrest, particularly in the Middle East, and has never fully embraced, for example, a Urals or Russian marker as a way of calculating oil. The Russian oil production, just taken on its own, could be a global marker, but the market has never fully embraced that as a marker because of the geopolitical activity and has urged us to continue to develop the way the oil infrastructure is reported and risk-managed through other venues. And I see that kind of playing out right now. There's no question that the back end of the curve, if you look at price adjustments in oil, I think the back end of the curve is up something like 13% or double-digit, low double-digit percent. And so the market is sending some longer-term price signals that they do think that there will be supply impact as a result of what's going on here. Scott A. Hill: Yes, and I think, I mean, just numbers-wise, again, July volumes were up 26% year-to-year, and for Brent, open interest is at record levels. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that translated to very strong energy revenue. So even despite a specific volatility change, I would suggest there's been a very evident interest change with the events that have occurred recently. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Got it. And then a quick one, Scott, for you on the expenses again. When we think about the leftover expense savings, so call it $310 million, I guess, or so, which you'll see at the end of this year, what's the pace, I guess, of the recognition of these savings? Scott A. Hill: Yes, I don't think we're really in a different place than we've talked about before. I think, as we enter into the first quarter, as we showed on the chart, I think we're on pace for $350 million of the original $500 million. I still think it's 90% as we exit '15, and so that will be reflected in the first quarter 2016 run rate. I think if you think about the $50 million additional synergies, my current expectation is you'll probably see us realize 30% to 40% of that as we go through 2015, with the remainder during 2016. So I don't -- the percentages don't move materially in terms of rate and pace, but again, I think we're well on track by the time we get to the end of 2016 to have removed the $550 million, which, as I noted, is well over 40% of the original NYSE Liffe expense base. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: And I think another way to think about it from an operational standpoint, which is how we run the business, is our next big move is to transition the European Liffe products onto the ICE platform. We're waiting until after the summer European holidays to begin that process, as soon as people get back in September. Work begins in earnest moving into October, November. Once we've moved those products over, we no longer need that platform and all of the support that goes around it. There will be people exiting. We also are selling off a number of technology businesses. Once those leave, their support people and others that have been left behind will be exiting. And so we're going to be going through a process as we reorganize these businesses, and it just sort of looks and feels like the end of the year, when a lot of that change will really kick in for us. Operator : The next question comes from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Actually, my questions have all been asked and answered. Operator : The next question then comes from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : So another question on the volumes. I'm really just wondering, as you guys see who's trading in your markets, how the commercial hedgers are actually behaving in this kind of low volatility environment. And the reason I ask is you wouldn't think that really depressed volatility would be impacting your activity, but you guys would obviously know better than me. Is there any light you could share on how that customer group is behaving? It'd be great. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Well, it's interesting. They're a part of our market, and they continue to be active in terms of gathering data and logging in and what have you and open interest levels. But the reality is that these are people that are -- the commercial guys are taking longer-term views on what's going to happen. They're not actively trading necessarily every day. So we do see them sort of setting up for some future event, which means buy open interest, longer-date it, and sit and wait for events. Shorter-term traders, liquidity providers and others that trade pure volatility as a result don't have as much to work against under that scenario. So that's why you see certain depressed volume, particularly in front-dated products. Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Great. And my other follow-up would be European natural gas. I mean, I know it's a small market for you guys but clearly growing very nicely. Jeff, can you help us understand the market setup there, I mean, who the competitors are for European nat gas? And then how big do you think the potential market is as more of those volumes kind of migrate to exchange? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Well, it's interesting. One thing that may or may not be known is that when the EMIR legislation was passed, which was basically the Europeans' equivalent to Dodd-Frank, gas and power were exempted from clearing, the clearing mandate. So those have historically been bilateral markets, and they will, under the new regulatory regime, continue to be able to be bilateral markets. And so a lot of electric utilities and gas utilities that have good balance sheets have always continued to trade those bilaterally. What's changing is the way banks and other counterparties are margining each other in the bilateral market, and at some point, it becomes somewhat equivalent to putting it in a clearinghouse. And as people put business into a clearinghouse, we can look at their entire portfolio of gas, power and oil and related products and give them meaningful margin offsets. And also, the clearinghouse allows us to extinguish contracts. If you buy and then sell and put it in a clearinghouse, you have gone completely off-risk because we've netted the 2 and extinguished them, which is not the case in the bilateral market. So people that are paying more attention to bankruptcy concerns and the fallout of the MF Global collapse and the like are generally trending towards moving that business on exchange. We have lots of competition and new competitors seemingly announcing every day. So none of that can really detour us. It's why we bought the Endex exchange. We wanted the Continental European people and the infrastructure that have close relationships in that market, and all of that has really worked to our advantage and has helped us grow the business. I suspect we'll have people coming in. They'll be paying for order flow. They'll be doing all the nonsensical things that happen in other markets, but none of that really has seemed to have any negative impact on us. And frankly, some of it has probably, overall, expanded the market and, in a backhanded way, inured to our benefit. Operator : And our last question today comes from Akhil Bhatia of Rosenblatt. Akhil Bhatia : Could you just give us a sense on how much cash you expect to receive from the sale of the Technologies businesses and how much cash you spent on the patent acquisitions? Scott A. Hill: We don't -- we haven't disclosed those amounts, Akhil, so unfortunately, I can't provide that. I will tell you that with regards to the NYSE Technologies sale, that's an additional source of cash that we'll be putting to good use, either through capital returns or investments in our business. But we haven't disclosed those amounts publicly. Akhil Bhatia : Okay. And then just a follow-up. What types of M&A opportunities are you seeing out there? Is there anything you're particularly focused on? Or what are you seeing out there? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Well, there've been a number of -- we've been invited into a number of very sort of high-profile dispositions, particularly a number of things by banks and others that have gone to auction. We have declined to participate in a number of them simply because we haven't been able to meet our return on investment thresholds. And some of them have been amazing franchises and very interesting things, but we don't feel like we should destroy shareholder value in order to own them. So it does seem to be a pretty active market for things that are coming up for sale or what have you, but we really haven't necessarily been participating. We have a buy-versus-build strategy around here, so we look at where do we want to go, and then once we determine where we want to go, we figure out how quickly can we build it or are there parts of it that we need to acquire from others and are those available to us. And so that's really what drives our thinking here. And it's worked well for us and created a lot of value for shareholders over a period of years, so nothing has changed in that regard. But it has been interesting to see sort of some of the high prices that have been discovered for some of the other assets that have traded recently to our peers. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, for any closing remarks. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Well, thank you all for joining us this morning, and we'll continue to keep you apprised of our continued progress. Have a good morning. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kelly Loeffler. Please go ahead. Kelly L. Loeffler: Good morning. ICE's third quarter 2014 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of theice.com. These items will be archived, and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2013 Form 10-K. In addition to GAAP results, we also refer to non-GAAP measures, including adjusted income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted expenses, adjusted debt to EBITDA and adjusted EPS. These measures adjust GAAP results for extraordinary items, including nonoperating impacts of our acquisitions. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our core performance. You'll find the reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP term in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful as well as how management uses these measures. Net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses. Adjusted net income refers to adjusted net income from continuing operations, and adjusted EPS refers to adjusted diluted continuing operations earnings per share. With us on the call are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Chuck Vice, President and Chief Operating Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Scott. Scott A. Hill: Thank you, Kelly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. I'll begin on Slide 4, where you can see our performance for the first 9 months of 2014. ICE's adjusted earnings per share rose 5% year-to-year to $6.53. Through September, our adjusted operating margin stands at 50%. We have generated record operating cash flows of $922 million, and consolidated net revenues were $2.3 billion. Notably, we delivered these results despite low volatility, which resulted in futures volumes declining 17% year-to-year. Regardless of the challenging volumes, open interest levels are up, revenues have remained stable, we are on track to achieve nearly 50% of our synergy target in 2014, we've expanded margins from 45% to 50% and we've grown earnings. In addition, the record levels of cash we have generated, combined with the divestment of nonstrategic businesses, has enabled us to sharpen our strategic focus, delever and return over $700 million of capital to shareholders. And importantly, our October volumes demonstrate once again what happens when open interest levels are increasing and volatility returns. Please turn to Slide 5, where I will highlight our third quarter results. Consolidated net revenues were $745 million, adjusted operating expenses were $377 million and adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 49%. Adjusted net income was $245 million, and adjusted earnings per share rose 9% to $2.15 per share versus $1.97 in the prior third quarter. And of note, we have now repurchased 2% of the total shares outstanding at the time the NYSE acquisition was closed. Let's move to Slide 6, where I'll detail third quarter revenues and expenses. On the left side, you can see that net transaction and clearing revenues totaled $447 million. Market data revenues, as expected, bounced back from a dip in the second quarter largely related to the Euronext separation and totaled $105 million. Our data revenues also benefited from continued growth in our subscriber base and additional value capture from our enhanced data offerings. This sustained demand for market data indicates continued interest in our diverse markets despite a cyclical downturn in trading volume. Our listings revenues generated a record $86 million, which was up 11% compared to the prior third quarter on a pro forma basis. And finally, other revenue contributed $107 million in the third quarter. The right side of Slide 6 shows our expense detail. Third quarter adjusted expenses were $377 million. We came in better than our prior expense guidance, primarily reflected in lower compensation expenses due to 3 factors : first, compensation expense was lower by roughly $3.5 million due to some clean-up related to the Euronext separation; second, we recorded a year-to-date true-up of about $3.5 million related to our performance-based bonus accrual to reflect our expectation that, despite continued growth in earnings, we will come in slightly below our 2014 targets; and finally, and most importantly, we're realizing the cost reductions associated with our integration efforts faster than anticipated. Not only did this help us outperform in 3Q, but it also helped improve our full year expense guidance. And importantly, we expect that momentum to carry into 2015. Turning now to Slide 7, I'll detail our derivatives revenue and volumes for the third quarter. Total futures and options revenue was $320 million, with our oil and ag complexes each generating solid growth. Despite a 13% decline in daily volume compared to the prior third quarter, open interest increased 2% from the end of the year to 76 million contracts. Both Brent and other oil open interest are at record levels, up 26% and 21%, respectively, from the start of the year. Ags and equity derivatives open interest were up 3% and 33%, respectively. Interest rate open interest was flat through the end of September but increased in October. While activity in our North American natural gas markets remains muted, total natural gas revenues were basically flat thanks to the solid trends in our European natural gas markets. Moving next to Slide 8, we highlight the notable improvements in our October volumes. While one month does not necessarily indicate a trend, you can certainly see what the combination of increased NOI and a return to a more normal ag volatility environment can do to improve trading activity. Total volume for the month was flat year-over-year with continued significant declines in Euribor volumes, offset by strength in Brent, other oil, Sterling, Gilt, other ag and equity indices. Brent ADV was up 28% over the prior October, driven by oil price volatility as oil prices go to levels not seen since 2012. Other oil ADV increased 20% in October, benefiting from both volatility and new products we continue to introduce to complement our Brent complex. Our Sterling and Gilt average daily volumes were up 62% and 60%, respectively, compared to the prior October due to improving economic sentiment in the U.K. Other ags were up 10%, and equity indices were up 50% compared to the previous October. In addition to the growth across many of our derivatives products, our U.S. cash equities volumes also grew 32% in October, driven by volatility in equity markets, with market share up nearly 2 percentage points to 23.9%. We'll provide more details in our October volume release, which will be issued tomorrow morning. Let's now continue with our credit derivatives markets on Slide 9. CDS revenues were $38 million in the third quarter, including clearing revenues, which increased 3% to $23 million. Over the first 9 months of 2014, we continued to enhance our cleared product set, including clearing for the Markit iTraxx Senior Financial CDS Index and various prominent CDS instruments. It's worth noting that through September, 40% of the $4.9 trillion of buy-side gross notional cleared comes from European buy-side customers clearing through ICE Clear Credit, our U.S. CDS clearinghouse. This trend is happening as a result of the regulatory uncertainty in Europe; the Brent products that we uniquely offer, including all major indices, all constituent single names and a multitude of sovereign CDS products; and the capital efficiency that we are uniquely able to provide via our portfolio margining capabilities. Importantly, this business is now on track to deliver just under $100 million of revenue in 2014, and it is contributing meaningfully to our bottom line. Please turn to Slide 10, and I'll walk through our NYSE business. On the trading side, we are peeling back layers of complexity and opening up the exchange for the benefit of issuers and investors, which will ultimately benefit the trading environment. And amid these efforts, NYSE's market share has notably strengthened and our revenue capture remains solid. We continue to work to enhance our equities trading business to better serve customers and to operate more efficiently in order to generate increased profitability and cash flows. We're also making investments to improve our corporate services offering to leverage the strength of the NYSE brand and our strong customer relationships. Stacey Cunningham, formally a leader of our equities business, has been appointed as President of NYSE Governance Services to help lead our efforts. And just last week, we acquired a small innovative technology business to further enhance our role as thought leaders in the governance, risk and compliance space. Moving to the bottom of Slide 10, the lower left graph clearly reflects the New York Stock Exchange's continued leadership in global listings. In the third quarter, we had a record 29 IPOs and raised a record $37 billion. And even without the Alibaba IPO, the capital raised on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange was greater than the next 4 listing venues combined. The NYSE's hybrid market model and transparent IPO platform continues to attract companies of all sizes and industries from around the globe. Our IPO pace is trending well above 2013, and we remain on track for our third consecutive record year in technology IPOs. We are making solid progress at the NYSE, and we are optimistic about 2015. Now let's talk about our strong cash flows and capital structure on Slide 11. Operating cash flows grew to a record $922 million in the first 9 months of the year. At September 30, we had over $650 million in unrestricted cash and short-term investment, excluding the $1.2 billion set aside for the repayment of our euro notes in June 2015. We used our strong cash generation for strategic growth investments and to return over $700 million to our shareholders through October. Year-to-date, we have paid $225 million in dividends, and this morning, we announced a fourth quarter dividend of $0.65 per share. We repurchased over $500 million in ICE stock through October and have over $500 million left in our current repurchase authorization. We also announced 2 strategic acquisitions in the quarter, SuperDerivatives and the Holland Clearing House, which will accelerate our growth initiatives related to clearing and data services. We closed on SuperDerivatives in October and expect to close on the Holland Clearing House during the fourth quarter. Total net debt, which reflects cash set aside to repay the euro notes, was $2.9 billion, and our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio was 1.6x. As we mentioned during last quarter's call, we may move around our leverage target temporarily based on the cash flow of the business, credit rating considerations, the timing of strategic investment opportunities and our capital return program. I'll wrap up my remarks on Slide 12 with an update on our financial reporting and guidance. As ICE continues to build its earning power and expand its cash generation, we want to provide our shareholders with greater clarity regarding the financial strength of our business. Therefore, starting in the fourth quarter, we will report our adjusted earnings per share excluding expenses related to the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. To help with the transition, we have provided you with the first 3 quarters of 2014 on this basis on Slide 26 in the appendix of the presentation. In addition, as we have historically, we will continue to provide an annual view of the return on invested capital metric to demonstrate the impact on shareholder value of the capital we've invested. We believe the combination of the new adjusted EPS measure and the continued use of ROIC as a key metric will further enhance the transparency of our financial reporting. Also, please note that we have provided separate guidance related to SuperDerivatives. As you can see on the chart, we expect SuperDerivatives will contribute between $15 million and $16 million to revenue, which we expect to be primarily in the market data revenue lines, and it will add $12 million to $13 million in expenses during the fourth quarter, including roughly $8 million to $9 million in compensation expense. We are already collaborating with the SuperDerivatives team to integrate common corporate functions and, far more importantly, to develop the strategic initiatives that will generate revenue growth across our clearing and data businesses. Finally, I want to provide an update on our NYSE expense synergies. By the end of 2014, we expect to achieve approximately $265 million in synergies, 10% better than what we showed you during our last earnings call and nearly 50% of the way towards our total $550 million synergy objective. So in summary, despite a double-digit decline in volumes over the first 9 months of 2014, synergy realization has accelerated, earnings have grown, operating cash flows were at record levels, we returned significant capital to our shareholders, and we made solid progress on key integration and growth initiatives. We remained focused on the needs of our customers. We enhanced our product mix and diversification, and we delivered record listings and market data results. I'll be happy to answer any questions during Q&A, and now I'll hand the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Thank you, Scott, and good morning. The solid results that Scott just reviewed are the result of significant progress on the NYSE integration and on executing across many growth initiatives. In the third quarter, we grew earnings despite double-digit declines in futures volumes, so you can see that trading volume alone is not a proxy for our earnings performance and that our expense discipline continues to drive solid results. Through our strategic focus, our mix of business is improving as we rightsize the company and position it for the future. Since Scott just provided an update on synergies, I'll begin on Slide 13 with an update on our time line for further integration. We've accomplished a lot in just 3 quarters, and we continue to execute at or ahead of schedule. Since closing the NYSE transaction, we divested technology businesses, operationally and financially separated Euronext and Liffe and divested Euronext through a successful IPO. And we're on track to end the year with nearly 50% of our synergy expenses achieved. Four of the 5 scheduled phases of the Liffe exchange transition have already seamlessly been completed, with the last one scheduled to occur in a few weeks. This European initiative follows the earlier transition of the Liffe U.S. markets to ICE's futures exchanges over the summer. In addition to migrating customers from one trading platform to another, we developed a new matching engine for our interest rate markets, which is based on Liffe's popular trade-matching algorithm. Completing the move of Liffe products will further enhance our progress with synergies, which we expect to be fully reflected in our first quarter 2015 run rate. We've received positive customer feedback regarding the transition, and we continue to expand our client-facing team to better serve these customers. I want to thank our Liffe exchange customers for their engagement in the successful transition and for their helpful feedback. Let's move to Slide 14, where I'll discuss our European interest rate complex. Low interest rates across the eurozone continued to negatively impact Euribor futures volume in the third quarter. Excluding Euribor, which comprises about 1/2 of our interest rate volume, average daily volume was down only 3%, and open interest in these contracts actually rose 47% year-to-date, which is represented by the green line in the chart. Contributing positively to this trend was a 14% increase in Gilt average daily volume for the quarter, which seems to be driven by improving economic sentiment in the U.K. So while average daily volumes in European interest rate contracts declined 31% in the third quarter, the related revenue decreased only 17% on a pro forma basis, as you can see in the chart on the right-hand side. Finally, with October interest rate volume down only 8% and our open interest moving up, we continue to believe that we acquired our interest rate franchise at the bottom of an interest rate cycle. Turning to Slide 15. You can see that, in addition to the secular trends that have produced annual growth in ICE's Brent crude volume, more volatility due to economic and geopolitical uncertainty also drove volume growth and record open interest. In the third quarter, ICE's Brent average daily volume increased 8% year-on-year, and open interest reached an all-time record of 3.2 million contracts. In October, Brent volume grew nearly 30% year-to-year to 817,000 contracts per day, so we've started the fourth quarter at a very solid run rate. And based on the growth in Brent volume, even in light of lower volatility we saw early in 2014 and the payment for order flow schemes offered by our competitors, the long-term relevance of ICE Brent continues to rise. Importantly, in October, ICE's Brent open interest has surpassed NYMEX WTI open interest for the first time in the history of these contracts. This is largely driven by the increased adoption of Brent by commercial customers. We've also seen a payoff from our focused marketing efforts to make Brent a larger component than WTI in most commodity indexes. The Commitment of Traders report continues to show increasing volumes in our energy markets being held by commercial customers, as we see our competitors adopting incentives that attract the type of algorithmic trading that typically drives commercial users away. Combine that with the capital efficiencies in our clearinghouse across our oil products, totaling more than 400 related futures contracts, and you can see why the customer benefits that ICE provides is increasingly being determined by the cost efficiency of customer collateral rather than simply the price of trade execution. Turning to Slide 16. North American natural gas volumes remained muted in the third quarter, given low volatility and range-bound prices. However, I want to note that North American volumes in October increased 30% from July's average daily volume and were down just 10% over the prior October, so we're seeing improving activity to start the fourth quarter. On the right side of the chart, you can see the European markets, and they're driving a favorable mix shift in our gas business overall. With the shift of ICE Endex Exchange onto the ICE platform last year, price transparency has increased, as has liquidity, due to this virtuous trend which attracts more market participants. As you'll recall, Endex is a business we acquired in the first part of 2013, and it's a great example of how our strategic M&A enables us to stay in front of emerging growth opportunities. In the third quarter, European gas volumes nearly doubled year-to-year and open interest reached 1 million contracts. And we continue to add new products to serve our base of European utility customers who now trade electricity, natural gas and emissions on our integrated trading and clearing platform. On Slide 17, I'll walk through some of our new initiatives for the coming quarters, all of which relate to offering more risk management tools and building on the value of our data. Starting with our announcement this morning. We expect to launch ICE Futures and ICE Clear Singapore in March of 2015 with a range of locally relevant products which we'll further announce in the coming weeks. We've operated an office in Singapore for the past decade, so we're well established there with a very strong team. Demand continues to rise in Asia for risk management and new products, and we're increasingly hearing that our customers want to hold risk under various understandable and manageable regulatory frameworks. We expect to serve their demand, ranging from commodities to financial contracts, all built around the desire for liquidity, clearing, flexibility, global distribution and the capital efficiencies that ICE can uniquely offer. During the third quarter, we announced the acquisition of a 75% stake in the Holland Clearing House, which we expect to close by the end of this year. This transaction gives us a clearing footprint in Continental Europe, which matches nicely with our similarly Amsterdam-based ICE Endex Exchange. The Holland Clearing House provides clearing services for the Dutch options MTF known as The Order Machine. The Holland Clearing House will enable us to leverage our clearing platform across yet another jurisdiction and can offer flexibility to our customers if the rules around eurozone-based clearing ultimately differ from those in other jurisdictions. Last but not least, I want to highlight our acquisition of SuperDerivatives. We've long worked with SuperDerivatives, as have many other exchanges and clearinghouses, to support our settlement and clearing activities. We've come to understand and appreciate the breadth of their quantitative valuation services and how this can contribute to improving ICE's already strong risk management capabilities. SuperDerivatives also provides a very robust low-cost desktop with extensive data across virtually all asset classes. There are a number of avenues to leverage our combined capabilities to expand our risk management infrastructure and our data services. Turning now to Slide 18. You can see a range of growth drivers and how they fit with the new initiatives that I've just described, all of which support our long-term growth. The takeaway from this slide is that there are a range of opportunities for growth across all of our asset classes and geographies, based on the increasing role of clearing, a return of global volatility to trading, new services to support our clients in meeting their regulatory requirements and the demand for our listings and data businesses. And we have the unique opportunity through our synergies to create additional significant value and solid margin expansion. ICE has grown earnings consistently for the last decade and remains a growth company. We have continued our strong commitment to product development and expansion of our clearing services by launching over 100 new energy contracts year-to-date. For context, since 2008, when we made significant investments to be in control of our own vertically integrated clearing capabilities, we have introduced more than 1,000 new products. In addition to our geographic reach, we've expanded into benchmarks and into intellectual properties. ICE Benchmark Administration was launched last February, taking over the supervision of the LIBOR benchmark and, most recently, the ISDAFIX benchmarks. ICE Benchmark Administration has worked closely with the industry to evolve these key benchmarks to support confidence and innovation in these products. As we look to 2015 and beyond, we continue to believe that we can no longer sit in one jurisdiction to serve customers around the world. We've invested to serve local and global markets from the U.S., the U.K., Continental Europe, Canada, Singapore and Brazil. The challenge of differing regulatory environments has resulted in a demand for increased flexibility of jurisdictions when listening to our customers' reactions to the regulatory barriers that they are facing. We continue to anticipate shifts in customer preferences as they respond to regulatory differences across these jurisdictions. As Scott just pointed out, we've seen a recent uptake of European customers increasingly moving their swaps clearing to the U.S. So it's important for ICE to maintain flexibility in the location of our infrastructure. As always, we're evolving our business to support our customers' requirements. The New York Stock Exchange continues to lead in global listings, which is yet another growth driver for us. In the past year, I've had the opportunity to work with many business leaders and entrepreneurs, either in their offices around the world or when they visit the New York Stock Exchange at 11 Wall Street. I've experienced firsthand and I've also heard from many new public company managers the emotion that one feels when standing on our balcony and ringing the bell and what it means for their company's ability to invest higher and grow by accessing the best capital markets in the world when becoming a U.S.-listed company. This is why we remain a leading voice in driving further improvements in U.S. market structure. The equity markets fundamentally exist for capital raising and the protection of that capital, and it's our mission to ensure that a company's stock trades in a fair, efficient and transparent manner. As you can see, both our market share of secondary trading and our related revenue capture are doing well. We believe that the NYSE will be a more attractive business with our planned technology enhancements, rightsizing the expense base and by taking a leadership role in market structure change. And I commend SEC Chair White's leadership for helping to focus the current market structure discussions on driving liquidity and transparency back to markets while reducing the inherent risk that is caused by structural complexity. One year ago, after completing the acquisition of NYSE, we detailed our extensive integration and strategic plans. Today, we've either completed or shown significant progress on these objectives. On Slide 19, you can see that progress on the plans we set out for you, with the green check marks indicating the items that we've completed since our last call. During the quarter, we also completed 2 acquisitions and announced a third in what will become the company's seventh clearinghouse. At the same time, we returned over $700 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and we have largely completed the successful transition of the Liffe Exchange. As you can see, we've had a very productive 2014. I'll finish my remarks now on Slide 20 with our commitment to consistently focus on earnings growth and creating value. We're in the business of risk management, where there's growing demand around the world. We maintain our focus on being customer-centric and results-oriented, and these results include earnings growth, increased cash generation and industry innovation. Before I close, I want to give a special thanks to Edwin Marcial, who's retiring from ICE after leading our technology team. Edwin was one of the 7 original employees that built ICE into the leading global exchange operator that it is today. Among many other accomplishments, Edwin attracted a very strong technology team here to ICE, and this team has been a critical part of our success, and it continues to drive our business forward. All of us here are grateful to our friend Edwin for his many contributions. And finally, on behalf of everyone at ICE, I want to thank our customers for trusting us with their continued business and for collaborating with us on the many industry changes that are underway. I'll now ask our operator, Kate, to conduct a question-and-answer session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Rich Repetto from Sandler O'Neill. Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : I guess the question is for Scott, first on expenses. And I'm just trying to get my arms around the different moving parts here because you've got SuperDerivatives, you've got an increase in the -- sort of the synergies. So I don't know how to frame this, but what do you expect expenses -- you put out the guidance for 4Q. How do you expect that to -- now to be -- look like in 1Q? Will it go down by the synergy amount, the $350 million minus $265 million divided by 4? But then you get SuperDerivatives and you get the bonus accruals, so I think we're getting lost a little bit in the moving parts in the expense picture. Scott A. Hill: Yes, Rich, look, there are a lot of moving parts, and I'll acknowledge this year has been a little bit bumpy as we've tried to get our arms around it as well. I think that the high-level picture is what I said in my remarks. The synergy realization is accelerating. You see that in the third quarter. You see it in our improved full year guidance. You're going to see it in the first quarter, and you're going to see it in 2014. So we've talked previously about being on a run rate as we hit the first quarter of $350 million. I think that's going to now be north of $380 million. I think, if you look on an absolute basis in 2015, we're going to realize another $135 million or so of synergies. There'll be some incremental investments. I mean, we are going to restore the bonus. We are going to have an increased program with some of our employees. But even if you net out maybe $30 million of incremental investment, that still means our expense base will come down by over $100 million in 2015. As you mentioned, we do have some acquisitions, but any expense we add there is going to be more than compensated by revenue, and that's before we even start to talk about the synergies we think we can generate around those businesses, predominantly growth-related synergies and top line synergies. So as I look at the expense in the fourth quarter and into 2015, we're feeling really good. And frankly, even as we think about our exit rate, we've talked previously about $450 million as we move into '16, I think we're going to be ahead of that number as well. So the headline is the expenses are going to be better. We'll certainly give you more guidance as we enter into 2015 on our fourth quarter earnings call. But I think, for now, we've given you a good view of what we think fourth quarter looks like, and I've given you a few pieces to work with in 2015. Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : Okay, Scott, that's helpful. I guess my one follow-up, Jeff, would be on the broader picture on, I guess, energy and Brent. And you gave a lot of good information on how strong the bench -- the increasingly strong bench market. But I guess my question is, with oil prices coming down below $80 a barrel, is that a good thing longer term if it stays there? Certainly, if you look at the cash equity markets, when you see prices hit low, you see plenty of volume and volatility, just sort of like you experienced with Brent volumes in October. But it generally isn't good if it stays that way for an extended period of time, so I'm just trying to see what you think of this $80 price. And is it good in the longer term, if crude stays there, for your volumes and so forth? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Well, the interesting thing about physical commodities, including oil, is that there are always supply and demand consequences, and the market is always reacting to those, and then you throw on top of it acts of God that tend to impact delivery. And so you have natural volatility, which is why our customers hedge. The last time oil prices came down, we set volume records. The market does better for us when there is just volatility in the market. It doesn't matter whether it's volatility to the downside or volatility to the upside. And then as you pointed out, when you get in sustained periods at price lows or price highs and without a lot of volatility, the market kind of settles down again and we don't see as much trading activity. So long story short, we've sat for quite a long time around the $100-barrel level, plus or minus, and we seem to be resetting. So this is a very good trend for us. You lay on top of that macro trends that I mentioned to you, which is just the increased use of Brent ever since this company has been a public company -- and in fact, in our public company roadshow, we talked about how we were going to go out and really market Brent. And we've been doing that for the last decade, and it's paying off. We're -- it's growing in the indexation of the business. The options business, which there was none for Brent, is now a growth driver for us. We've been able to shift commercial customers increasingly to use Brent for hedging, including customers in the U.S. that used to not really think of Brent as a natural hedge, and so all of those macro trends laying on top of the volatility in pricing, which bodes well for us. Last but not least, open interest is growing. That's always a good indicator when the markets are operating, and so it's a good predictor for future volumes for us under these conditions. Operator : Our next question is from Kenneth Hill from Barclays. Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Research Division : I just wanted to talk about the other revenue line. It seems like it's becoming -- or has been your second-biggest line item there. I was just wondering if there are any plans to kind of break out. You've got a number of pieces moving through there, whether they're fees or the technology business, and how we can kind of think about those going forward or at least what your outlook might be for the technology business, in particular going forward. Scott A. Hill: Yes. So it's a fair question, Ken. The challenge is there's probably 6 or 8 different things that make that $100 million up. So in the scheme of things, $100 million of our $3 billion of revenue is relatively small, and if I broke it out in a lot of detail, we're talking about even smaller numbers. It's network connectivity fees around safety. It's -- I talked a little bit in my prepared remarks about the corporate governance services that we provide. That's embedded in there. So I think we've tried to give you a little bit of guidance in terms of our expectations. Other revenues are going to be relatively stable. We'd certainly come out and be transparent if we thought there was going to be a material up or down move in that line. But generally speaking, they're just -- there are a number of smaller items that make the amount up, and I don't think it would provide a whole lot of value to investors to provide a lot of additional detail. Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay, fair enough. And then on the market data side, we saw a nice bounce-back here in the third quarter. I think some of that was expected, given some recovery of the Liffe market data revenues from 2Q declined. But was any of that related to beginning to monetize more of the Benchmark Administration segment as well? Scott A. Hill: It wasn't. The market data revenues are really -- it's what you talked about. So we had a little bit of a blip as we worked through the Euronext transition in the second quarter. As we mentioned on the 2Q earnings call, we did expect that to come back, and it did. But what you're really seeing in the market data is we continue to see more people that want ID, more people that want our screen. That trend line continues up for us. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I really think it's indicative of the continued interest in our markets. And so people tend to focus on volumes down 17% or flat volumes, but if you step back and you look at market data trends, if you look at open interest trends, if you look at the number of people who are wanting access to our markets, that's why you get an October when volatility returns and Brent volumes are great and Sterling volumes are great. So it really is about interest in the markets. It's about the data that we're growing and have the ability to package up and sell. And that's another area where, frankly, SuperDerivatives is going to contribute in the future, is the ability to distribute even more data in a more seamless manner. So those are the kind of things that are going to drive that growth line. Make no mistake, the benchmark -- the IBA business is certainly one that, as we move into 2015, we do expect to grow, and I expect you'll see that helping the market data fees as well. But in the quarter, it's really more about the growing interest in our markets. Operator : The next question is from Ken Worthington of JP Morgan. Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : I would like to ask on pricing. So you continue to highlight the difference between volume and revenue growth, and pricing seems to be going higher across a number of products. And obviously, there's some mix changes in FX, but it does seem like the price per contract and the price per share are increasing beyond that. So can you talk a little bit about what's going behind the scenes, particularly in equities, where pricing and share are both increasing, which doesn't happen very often; and then on the Liffe side, where the rate RPC and financial RPC also seems to be on the rise? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Ken, this is Jeff. Yes, well, I've been pretty outspoken that I don't really believe that -- in payment for order flow schemes. I think they're value-destructive for shareholders. But beyond that, as a regulated exchange, if you want to pay people to show up in the market, in other words, expand the market by attracting traders that really don't want to hold the risk of your products but just want to pay to -- get paid to be there, it creates an incentive, unfortunately, for people that do wash trades, in other words, to buy and sell without ever actually trying -- holding any risk. And that's a disservice to the market, and it's self-regulated organizations. That's a policy that we need to prohibit. And so to actually be creating incentives to do that at the same time that you're trying to prohibit it seems counterintuitive and counterproductive. So what we have done in the new businesses that we have acquired is brought our philosophy on how to operate markets to those, and we're making subtle changes in the way we compensate market makers who do provide a valuable service to the market and getting rid of pricing schemes that we don't like, that we don't think are helpful. Obviously, at the New York Stock Exchange, we've been quite public about it, because of its stature, in how we've been eliminating order types and simplifying the business. And I think, at the end of the day, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the people that actually want to hold risk are attracted to those kinds of markets. They want to participate in markets where they're fair and they're transparent and they can get business done and that they're not subject to a lot of predatory practices that are really there because of economic incentives. And it's why, frankly, you hear us not talk a lot about market share or trying to use ICE's absolute volumes as a predictor of our earnings per share. We're a growth company, and when we talk about growth, we mean earnings per share growth and shareholder value creation and not just growing top line volumes, which we could easily do by having payment for order flow schemes. But it's just really not in our DNA. We have other actors in the market that do, do those things. It allows us to differentiate ourselves. And when we differentiate ourselves, it gives us a selling opportunity to customers, and that's what I mentioned is happening, we believe, in the Brent market. And it's really -- it creates a virtuous circle for us because these kinds of commercial users of markets really are quite sticky and appreciate the kind of service that we provide. Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Great. And as the follow-up, has your philosophy fully permeated the pricing at Liffe? Or is there more to go there? And then same question separately on the New York Stock Exchange. Is there more to go there as well? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: I think it's fair to say there's more to go in the sense that all the new businesses that we acquire have legacy contracts in place and legacy pricing systems and other things that, either through regulatory action or through letting contracts run off, take time to change. But we have our teams focused on exactly these issues, on simplifying markets, making them better, more transparent, and I think that work will continue well into 2015. Operator : The next question is from Christian Onwugbolu from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Chinedu Christian Onwugbolu - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Jeff, a bigger-picture question on strategy. You are building a franchise, an impressive array of services across clearing, post-trade services and data. And you've spoken about your desire to offer value beyond trade margin. But given trade margins still account for the vast majority of your revenues, I'm curious to how -- your overall plan on how you monetize these services. Should they drive more volumes? Is it better pricing or something else we're not thinking about? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Well, it's a good question. First of all, I think, actually, if you look at our pricing schedule, the bulk of our earnings probably today come substantially due to clearing and post-trade services, which is a big shift for the company just given that in 2007 was the first time we even had any kind of clearing infrastructure, and we really started expanding it during the financial crisis and shortly thereafter. But what we're hearing from our customers, particularly due to the regulatory uncertainty which exists in almost every jurisdiction around the world, is that people need solutions. And the rules are still being written, so that it's not fully clear to everybody what solutions are needed and where they are needed. And so it's just been our goal really since the financial crisis to be -- have assets geographically located and up and down the value chain so that we can provide those services. And we've been surprised. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, it's surprising to see the European business leaving Europe and coming to the U.S. That isn't something we really could have predicted even 2 years ago. We have a strong sentiment that business is going to continue to move to Asia, and we're making investments there. We see our competitors following us oftentimes in those areas, so I think there's obviously a trend going on there. So long story short, during these times of uncertainty, it's been good for us to have a lot of assets, and we'll see how they play out. Honestly, we just want to provide solutions and charge appropriately for them, and our customers will largely dictate where that value will be created and what part of the value chain that they're willing to give to us. Chinedu Christian Onwugbolu - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. On LIBOR administration, you've had a few months now to assess the customer base and the likely impact of charging for that product. It would be helpful if you could share with us maybe lessons learned, any statistics at all on likely demand for the product. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Sure. Well, the first thing is we are amazed by the breadth of the use of LIBOR around the world. Just the sheer number of people that will need a license from us is somewhat overwhelming. And so we've been having a lot of conversations with industry trade groups and other ways of talking to a lot of customers at one time and one -- through one voice and one venue about how we go about actually signing people up and, ultimately, charging for the -- for an appropriate value. Everyone wants LIBOR to be improved. Everyone wants LIBOR to be more predictable and based on auditable transactions. And so there's a strong interest in having us continue to invest in that product, and then the real question is how does the market pay for that and reward us for taking a risk. We spent a number of quarters having those conversations. We've not really settled on a plan that -- as Scott mentioned, we'll start seeing economics roll through us in 2015. We do want to make it easy for people to sign up. I think, as we continue to integrate SuperDerivatives into the company, we'll have a platform by which it will be easier for our customers to access the LIBOR, if they don't have an easy way to access it already. And so that's, directionally, the plan we're going. I think you're going to see it play out in 2015 and beyond as the market gets used to the fact that this is a benchmark that has value, that is transparent, that they do rely on and they're willing to market -- willing to license as we market it to them. Operator : The next question is from Chris Allen with Evercore. Christopher J. Allen - Evercore ISI, Research Division : You'd mentioned earlier that bonus accrual expected to go back up next year. And I'm just wondering about how you guys are thinking about the growth opportunities from a top line perspective looking into next year because, I mean, the feedback right now from the buyside is pretty challenging outlook given where the ECB rate environment is, oil prices sub-80 and U.S. natural gas volatility remaining subdued. So I'm just wondering, where are you most optimistic about growth for -- into next year? Scott A. Hill: I think it goes back to what Jeff said, Chris. I'm most optimistic about our ability to grow earnings. And we are in a difficult volume environment. But I step back and look at all the other levers that we've got in order to generate growth. We've got a very strong market data business. We've got a business in listings that had a very good 2014. And as you know, that largely flows through into revenues in 2015. We've got -- I just basically gave you a 2015 guidance that we're going to take out over $100 million of expenses next year. We've repurchased 2% of our outstanding shares since we closed the deal. So as I look towards 2015, even in a difficult volume environment, I'm very confident we'll grow our earnings double digits next year. So I feel -- look, and then again, I look at an October that had huge Brent volume growth. Again, OI has been trending up. Here comes volatility. There goes volumes. The U.K. sentiment is improving, as I mentioned. There goes Sterling and Gilt volumes in October. I look at equity indices that I think I mentioned were up 50% year-over-year in October. Continued strength in the MSCI contract, continued strength in the FTSE. So I think, when the buyside you're referring to talks about challenges, they're thinking about Euribor and nat gas. And we're more than Euribor and nat gas, and I think that's what gets missed. Christopher J. Allen - Evercore ISI, Research Division : Got it. And then just a quick follow-up. Just on the increase in synergy realization and just in terms of the pace and then first quarter being north of $380 million, just kind of curious what's driving that? Scott A. Hill: Yes, Chris, I think there are a couple things. I think, number one, it's -- we've had to merge the finance and forecasting systems and all that over the course of the year, and we're just getting better at getting the information up into a consumable fashion. But I think the other thing that we're really focused in on, and we've talked about this a lot, we, historically, at ICE have had about 5% of our population in consultants, give or take a little bit. NYSE was closer to 20%. And we've mentioned on at least 2 or 3 occasions that, that's an area where we've been focused and where we're starting to see some yield from those efforts. I think, as you look into fourth quarter, you're going to see professional services expense start to trend down a little bit related to the exits of some of those consulting resources. So it's really -- it's just executing our plans, getting our arms around a little better the data that's coming up through our consolidated systems. And then it's really been a laser focus on trying to get back to the resource model that we've driven historically at ICE. Operator : The next question is from Alex Kramm with UBS. Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : I don't think this has been asked yet, but can you talk about the buybacks a little more? I mean, it seems like that post Euronext IPO, you did a big chunk, and then it's been fairly consistent, maybe $50 million, $60 million per quarter, and it sounds like October is $64 million again. So $150 million to $200 million per quarter, is that a good run rate to use until we extinguish that $500 million that you have left? Scott A. Hill: Yes, Alex, look, first of all, I think you have to remember that we were effectively precluded from doing buybacks until we got delevered. And so the big burst that you saw after Euronext was us taking Euronext proceeds, getting delevered and, I would suggest to you, catching up a little bit from the fact that we hadn't been in the market earlier in the year. I wouldn't change the way we characterize our thinking about share repurchases now. We've got strong cash flows. We pay our dividend. We're able to make acquisitions. And then we look at what's the capital that we have left, what's available to us and what is the highest-value investment that we can make. And right now, looking at our share price and where it's been and where it's trending, that still looks like a pretty good deal, and I think that's reflected in what you're seeing as kind of a steady participation by us in the market. Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay, great. And then secondly, maybe just on synergies again but not on the cost side. I mean, I think somebody asked earlier around some of the pricing changes you've made or appear to have made on Liffe and NYSE. Can you expand a little bit beyond the transaction side? If you look at the NYSE today, how much time are you spending on looking what they've been charging for things like market data, for listings, for transactions, obviously, and some of the other things that they've done? And maybe talk a little bit more where there have been changes and where there's been maybe revenue synergies that you realized, if you have a dollar number, that'd be great; and maybe where there could be other opportunities as we look into 2015. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Well, Alex, as you know -- I think you know we now have Tom Farley, who's been a longtime colleague of everyone in this room, who's now fully ensconced in the exchange, and really his eyes and ears to be the envoy of -- to take the kind of operational mentality that we've had at ICE that has worked successfully for us and to put it into the exchange. So I think the NYSE is a great business and a great franchise and a great brand and has a lot of respect in the marketplace. And I think that it can be differentiated from others that want to provide services on more of a commodity basis. And what we have seen is there certainly are areas where people want to pay more to be affiliated with us and to also take advantage of the systems that we've put in place. I mean, it shouldn't be lost on anyone that, for example, the Alibaba IPO, which was one of the -- it was not only the largest IPO in history, but it was one of the most complicated transactions in terms of the number of firms on Wall Street that were involved, the distribution of their systems around the world, the pressure on the entire capital-raising platform around U.S. listings to manage that kind of demand in a single moment in time where we pushed millions of shares serially through these systems without a glitch. And so that was owed a lot of testing, a lot of communication, a really improving relationship I think we have with The Street and the market distribution system, all of which people are willing to pay for. So it's in that scheme that we're thinking about the New York Stock Exchange and what else we can continue to do there. You laid out on the fact that, I think, matching a buyer and seller of a U.S. equity is about the most simple market in the world. I mean, it's amazing how overly complicated the world has made what really should be, in my mind, the most simple market in the world. And we've gotten to a point where the average transaction size, regardless of who's buying, is 200 shares of stock. It really has gotten to a point where you can no longer tell the difference between a large institutional investor, an ETF buyer, you and I as retail investors or anyone else. And so it's become incredibly homogeneous and egalitarian, in a sense. And so it just sort of demands simplicity, and it seems like the simpler we try to make it, the more we're being rewarded. And so we're going to continue on that trend. Operator : The next question is from Niamh Alexander of KBW. Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : If I could just look at the cash and the CapEx, the real estate, I think it's pretty much in line with what you expected, but it still seems elevated for what you need to do. Just help me think about, is this a good run rate for next year, the year after? Is this how we should think about the level of CapEx and real estate spend that this business needs? Or is it kind of just post deal, and it should come in? Scott A. Hill: Yes, Niamh, thanks for the question. So I do think that you can look at 2014 as kind of a marker for where we would expect to be in 2015. The major investments that are embedded in that are the ones that we've talked about before. It's CapEx. It's real estate, as you noted, largely around us consolidating our real estate footprint in our major cities, particularly in New York, here in Atlanta, in London, et cetera. Obviously, with the addition of SuperD, we'll have some additional real estate and some additional consolidation work that we'll need to do. So I do think that what you're seeing in 2014 in terms of total levels of CapEx will be pretty consistent as you move into 2015. A big part of that investment, frankly, is enabling the synergies that we're achieving in the cost line. And so I mentioned earlier, 2015, I think, is going to be another good year in terms of synergy realization. And I think, as you get out into '16 and '17, you'll start to see those CapEx levels come down. Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : Okay, fair enough. And then on the, I guess, on the cash too, with respect to kind of the changing how you want to present your earnings a little bit. It's like, certainly, the cash earnings have exceeded the GAAP earnings at ICE for some time, and even more so since the deal because of the elevated D&A. So help me think about just, like, why now are you going to strip out the intangible amortization of the deals? Why is it -- is it not just a gimmick to kind of help your stock? Or why now? And what's the rationale? Scott A. Hill: Yes, so I think, Niamh, the rationale -- it's not a gimmick. I mean, the rationale is simply what you said, which is we believe that excluding the amortization of intangibles will give investors a much better view into the cash generative power of our earnings. Frankly, it's something that you see a lot of technology-oriented and particularly acquisitive technology-oriented companies doing in order to highlight, again, the cash generative trends embedded in their EPS. So this is really an effort on our part to continue to provide increasing amounts of transparency to shareholders. Importantly, though, we're not walking away from the investments that we've made. We're going to continue to focus on our returns on invested capital. That is a meaningful metric. Even as we -- we're kind of working our way through having that full investment embedded in that metric, and the profitability's still impacted by some of the integration costs, our ROIC remains above those of our nearest competitors. And again, we're at the bottom now, and the trend is only up from here. So I think the move to the adjusted EPS excluding the deal-related intangibles is common to acquisitive companies. It's more transparent for our shareholders, and we'll continue to focus on our returns. And Niamh, I know you follow the space well. Another company that just, for example, in our industry, does it is the London Stock Exchange. And again, I think it's -- Xavier does it for a similar set of reasons. Operator : The next question is from Michael Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Two questions just on the recent acquisition. So first, Jeff, on the Holland Clearing House, if I think about the number of clearing houses that you guys have now globally, you're fairly well positioned. But when you think about over the next, I don't know if it's 2, 3, 5 years, when a lot of the regulations are finalized, do you think you're going to need that network, or will you get more consolidation, meaning clients are going to want to put more of their positions into a few clearing houses versus kind of sporadic around the world? And then just on the SuperDerivatives. So when I think about the opportunity there, is there an opportunity, obviously, for you guys to use some of that -- the risk management analytics internally? But on the client side, is there any way to like size what clients would be using this service, what they use currently? Any way to like try to size that opportunity over the next few years as you map that out? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Those are both good questions. First of all, on clearing, we don't really know where the market's going to go. I mean, one thing you can see is that the well-capitalized exchange operators are increasingly building clearing infrastructure and opening new clearing houses around the world. I think the clearing business is going to take well-capitalized operators because these are very complex businesses, and the barrier to entry is rising as a result of the capital needs of these clearing houses. We don't know what the Basel rules yet are going to do to many of our customers in terms of their ability to lend collateral and hold collateral and rehypothecate collateral on behalf of customers, whether or not it's going to make sense geographically to separate that or whether it will -- whether market forces will try to consolidate clearing in a small number of venues. We literally just don't know. And the nice thing about the Holland Clearing House is that it is an established clearing house with a customer that is providing revenues to cover the operation of that clearing house. It gives us a footprint in Continental Europe. There's a lawsuit, as you may know, that's going on between the U.K. and the EU over whether or not euro-denominated products should be cleared in the Eurozone. We don't know the outcome of that. I don't -- as a manager, I'm not willing to speculate on it. I just want to make sure that our customers can seamlessly operate with us should the lawsuit go one way versus another. So it gave us a really good reason to keep diversity. We put all of those clearing houses on a single platform. We have a small group of highly talented quantitative people that, increasingly, our customers are coming to know. We have a small group of really highly talented regulatory people that are providing a lot of advice to our customers. And so we're in a position to move positions around the world on behalf of our customers very, very seamlessly. And you've seen us do it many times before. We understand how it's done. Our customers have confidence in our ability to do it. So we just want to maintain that flexibility for them. I wish I knew the answer to it because we'd bias our behavior one place versus another. But right now, what are customers are telling us is regulatory reform has not yet rolled out. The Basel rules have not yet rolled out. And until we all have a pretty good view of what it ultimately looks like, people want to have a lot of flexibility. With respect to SuperDerivatives, one of the interesting things that has happened to this company is that, with the result of moving into various asset classes now, we have a very, very large and diverse data business. It's all been embedded at the various exchanges, largely. But increasingly now, with ICE Benchmark Administration, creating benchmarks with our swaps data repositories, holding positions, and with all of the clearing and execution venues that we have, both futures and OTC around the world across various asset classes, we have quite a data package. And SuperDerivatives gives us an opportunity to think about how we can best provide that directly to our customers for those that may want to take it that way. And in addition, we are producing a lot of risk management data and tools inside the company that we use in clearing. And increasingly, our customers want access to those so that they can do pro forma calculations and risk management ahead of trading. Particularly, I think, that's going to increase as customers are faced with limited collateral and multiple choices from global exchange operators on where and how to do business. And so it's hard to size that opportunity. I think it's a business that came along at exactly the right time for us because our customers are telling us that these are the kinds of things that they need access to. And I think the people at SuperDerivatives are better prepared to build a lot of that than ICE is itself. And so we're already integrating that company quickly, and we're turning over a lot of responsibilities to them. And I think we'll see how it pays dividends on the top line, but I know it's going to increase customer satisfaction a lot. Operator : Your next question is from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : So just a quick follow-up on SuperDerivatives, but I guess a bigger-picture question on the interest rate swap clearing opportunity for you guys in Europe. That marketplace, obviously, seems to be a little bit more crowded than what it is in the U.S. And I'm just curious how you guys think about what ICE's differentiating strength should be in that market that will set you apart from other players that are planning to compete in that space? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Well, it's a good question. I do think that what, as I mentioned before, what the market is sort of shaping up is the well-capitalized exchange operators are really investing in clearing technology and innovation around clearing technology. And I think you're going to see the sort of the usual suspects have very, very broad offerings across multiple asset classes and multiple jurisdictions. And it's ultimately then going to be the ability to market to customers, the ability to provide the right tools to give people the most capital-efficient way of doing business. I think that ICE led the way, for example, in investing in our risk waterfall. That was not a common process earlier in the history of clearing. So we've got skin in the game that influences the capital needs of our customers, lowers them, for example, but also similarly increases the demand, if you will, internally for our own people to manage that business as if it was their own money, because it is, and do a better job. And I think little innovative techniques along the way will differentiate the clearing houses. But I do think we've pretty much seen who the main players are going to be and where they're likely going to be located. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Got it. And Scott, a quick follow-up for you. And sorry, another one around expenses. But I guess, when you take a step back, and I appreciate all the color you guys have given out, and there's a number of moving pieces, but you've demonstrated a number of times at this point that you're able to flex your expense muscle, not just when it comes to the integration of the business but also when it comes to kind of legacy core ICE franchise. So as we think about beyond the synergies that are sort of still left, can you talk a little bit about where you think the normal like kind of core growth rate in the expense base is, assuming not a whole lot of change in the revenue environment? Scott A. Hill: Yes. It's a good question. And I think it's somewhat reflected in kind of what we've referred to, the investments as we entered into 2014, and I gave you kind of a brief preview of 2015. It's kind of in that 2% to 3% range. We had mentioned, coming into this year, $350 million [ph]. And that's on an expense base that, give or take a little bit, $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion, similarly, based on our guidance now, will be around $1.5 billion. I mentioned $30 million-ish of investments next year, which is about 2%. So -- and I think if you go back and look historically, that tends to be what you've seen from us. It's not a big expense growth. It largely is around us either hiring technology resources or continuing to pay competitively for our resources, but you don't see a lot of growth in professional services or SG&A or rent or any of those other lines. In fact, as we've consolidated real estate, rent has come down. As we've eliminated consultants, professional services have gone down. And so I'd say, overall, kind of 2% to 3% is a decent expectation bottom line. That's probably a little more on the compensation line, with some efficiencies generated out of the other line. Operator : And the next question is from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : I guess, just in terms of your customer mix if you're thinking about the energy segment, can you talk about, October, there was a spike in volatility? Can you talk about certain customers that are acting more -- being more active in that environment or who you're -- where you're seeing, even x that going back into the summer, where the most fall-off in terms of trading was in terms of your customers, and how kind of your commercial segment has held up during that time as well? Scott A. Hill: Yes, I think, historically, we've tended to underperform when you see spikes of volatility because we don't have the hedge funds. We don't tend to have more of the guys who are taking a speculative view on which way energy prices will go -- are going. But when you see a more sustained volatility, which we did see through October, it's a spike relative to what we'd seen in the year, but we were fairly confident in the month. What you see is OI positions that have grown, which is indicative of the commercial customers who are trading in our markets. They start to manage their positions around that volatility, trying to figure out what is this signal for where prices are going to be 3 months from now, 6 months from now, 9 months from now. And so I think it really gets down to the commercial customers that are in our base and the growth in open interest. And then once the volatility returns, it's those commercial customers that are managing their positions that tend to lead to the volume growth that we see. And that's why, with those spikes, you don't see big changes in our RPC. It tends to be pretty stable because it's not the price-sensitive guys that are piling in with volume. It's commercial customers that are managing their risk positions. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : That's helpful. And I guess just one more on the synergies. Can you talk about what milestones are left in terms of kind of the big buckets as you kind of head -- exit this year and into next year? Scott A. Hill: Yes. So obviously, the big one, as we exit this year, and Jeff mentioned, we're 4 out of the 5 transition cycles through the Liffe integration. We've got to get the fifth one done. That's the big one as we enter the year. As you look over the course of 2015, it's really some clean-up around some of the corporate functions and systems that we're integrating, Project Abby being an important one that will help us rationalize the technology footprint at the New York Stock Exchange. Clearly, real estate consolidation as we move later into '15 and into 2016. Prior to the NYSE deal, I think we peaked at 11 different leases in New York. We had finally gotten down to one prior to the deal. We've now got a handful of leases in New York again. We'll look to consolidate those. And again, that's why they're '15, '16. And then the other thing we announced, I think it was earlier in October, was that we're going to be bringing the regulation of the markets at NYSE back in-house. And so that's a synergy we'll be working on over the course of 2015. Frankly, embedded in the investments is the investment to build that functionality at NYSE. And then as you get out to 2016, we'll take that function on. So those are some of the bigger things. As you might expect, as we get deeper into '15, the items start to shrink in size, and it's a handful of smaller items as opposed to 1 or 2 large items. Operator : And the next question is from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : A really good year for you guys for CDS clearing. Scott, I think this is kind of tracking right in line with where you said it would be. How should we be thinking about the long-term growth rate for this part of your business? And then related to that, are there any catalysts to look forward to that could potentially get trading revenues growing again? Scott A. Hill: Yes, it's a great question. So as I step back and look at what's really driving the growth this year, the notional that's been cleared this year has been about 70% from the buyside. And if you think about it, 2 years ago, buyside wasn't even in clearing. Well, last year, I think it was 26% of our notional. This year, it's 70% of the notional. And that's what's really driving the revenue performance. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that European clients now make up 40% of the volume that we're clearing. Those European clients don't have a mandate to clear. And they're showing up in our clearing house because, number one, there is uncertainty in Europe with regards to what is the impact of Mifid II, what is the impact of EMIR. And I think customers are starting -- European customers are starting to look for what's become a relatively more certain environment in the U.S. I also think that they're attracted to the fact that we offer clearing not just of the indexed products, which is interesting but not particularly relevant if you don't also offer the single names. If you're long the names and short the index or vice versa, you don't want to be margined on both parts of that. You want to come to a clearing house that can offer you portfolio margining. We can do that. A lot of the trading activity that is happening today where we are seeing growth in CDS is single names, and it is sovereign. We offer all the major single names. We offer all the major sovereign CDS products. Remember that we still have to launch, but the ones where the trading is the largest, we offer those products for clearing. So I think all of those have been catalysts for the CDS growth, frankly. We earned -- or I said $23 million in the third quarter. We earned $12 million of revenue in the month of October. So as the CDS [indiscernible] were changed and we saw the lull moving to October, we had a fantastic October to continue that trend. As far as where the market goes, I think the big unknown is the last thing you asked in your question, and that's what happens with the trading environment. And I really -- my view is I think there are going to be 2 differences. I think, from an Endex standpoint, the question is does the indexed product stay in the over-the-counter market, as it is today, or does it move into something that's more like a futures. And we're working with the market to figure out what that product design might look like. Frankly, I think the single name is unlikely to change. I think that, as people are finding it harder and harder to get exposure to company's credit through the bonds, that we're seeing a pickup in that CDS activity. I think that's a good trend as we look forward. So I think there are a number of drivers. Even though the buyside has started to move in this year in size, I still think there's a lot of buyside clearing to go. So I think there are a number of growth drivers. Being able to tell you that I think a business is going to do just under 100, can grow 10%, 15%, 20%, 25% a year, I think it's hard to say without knowing the trading environment. But I certainly think the trend is up. I certainly think it's still a growth business for us. And again, an important thing not to get lost is it's not just revenue. It drops meaningful profit to our bottom line. So it's a good business for us. We expect it to continue to grow. And I think the big trends behind it are the buyside and the global nature of the clearing house here in the U.S. Operator : The next question is from Jillian Miller, BMO Capital Markets. Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: So just following up on that last question. You mentioned that a lot of the European buyside are already kind of accessing your CDS clearing offering despite the fact we don't have mandates yet. And I'm just trying to get a sense for whether we should be expecting some kind of step function when the mandates do come in, in early 2016 for the buyside or whether you think those folks are already clearing in advance or will, I guess, more gradually be moving into it throughout the course of 2015? Scott A. Hill: Yes, I think it's somewhere in the middle. I certainly don't expect some math that's step function because, again, we are seeing -- and it's not unusual, right? I mean, typically, it doesn't take a law to move people to clearing. It takes a realization that clearing really does reduce risk. So I think we are seeing the buyside move in. I certainly think the mandates will help. We saw that here in the U.S. We got some early participation from the buyside. But once the U.S. mandates kicked in, we certainly did see an uptick in the revenue. So I think that the subsequent mandates in Europe, which I'm now hearing could be pushed out all the way into early 2016, will halt, but I don't think it's a step function. I think the growth in that business, again, is going to come from an improvement of the trading environment, us continuing to launch more products and more people, more buyside customers in particular, seeking out efficient portfolio margining that we can deliver in our clearing house. Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. And then just wanted to check in and get a progress update on the Brazil initiatives, BRIX and Cetip. I think back, I mean, several years ago now, when you first moved into the area, but I think you said that those projects would potentially become more meaningful to the bottom line some time around 2015 or '16. And just wanted to see if that's still kind of generally the expectation and, I guess, just where we are with those projects. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Yes, look, I think I would characterize the Brazil relationship as continuing on a positive note, probably a little slower than what we would have anticipated. But I think, importantly, we've got a bond platform that we've launched with Cetip that has started to pick up some meaningful share. It's certainly being noticed by market participants, and that's one initiative that we've been very successful with. As you know, there's not a lot of clearing choice in Brazil. We have a strong clearing franchise of -- you might imagine there are other projects that we're working on with them. So I did say 2 or 3 years ago that I thought, as we got into '15, that we would start to see a little bit of yield. I think that's probably still a couple of years away in terms of seeing a meaningful yield within our P&L. That notwithstanding, we do think it is a very strategic environment for us. And I think Brazil is an important country. It's very commodity-rich. And so I think it's an important relationship where we'll continue to invest. I think the other thing not to get lost is we do participate as shareholders in the dividend, and you we saw, I think it was in the second quarter, where we got a meaningful dividend from that relationship as well. But on the more strategic front, I would characterize it as a little slower than we had anticipated but still a very positive relationship, a strong relationship and one that we do think will bear fruit as we look out into the future. Operator : The next question is from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Jeff, maybe you can expand a little bit on 2 of the acquisitions that you have on -- that you highlighted in terms of SuperDerivatives and maybe the Singapore effort as well. I appreciate, on the SuperDerivatives, it's still difficult to size that opportunity, but maybe if we can think of how you think you can scale that business from a revenue expense perspective. And maybe that's a question for Scott. But then also, on the Singapore side, what you see as the long-term growth outlook for that effort. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Well, sure. It's very hard to put numbers on it, and I know that's what, ultimately, you need. And as an entrepreneur, what I see in the company is that we have a lot of content, and we have an amazing sales force and customer relationship footprint. And they had great technology and really good quantitative people. And so it looks to us like 1 and 1 makes 3 in this regard. I really do think that ICE will have a lot of content and the distribution capabilities that we can bring to their systems, and we're embedding their quants right away into our risk management infrastructure, and they're helping us with a lot of complicated multi-asset class derivatizes that I think will pay dividends down the road in clearing and settlement capabilities. So it's all -- much of it is forward-looking, but it's a very, very nice fit for us. And it was an entrepreneurial company. It is an entrepreneurial company. It fits well within our culture. I think it's a company that we'll be able to quickly deliver some results on. With respect to Singapore, we -- we've spent the last few quarters basically embedding the ICE clearing and trading technology into that Singapore Exchange. We've put a whole new team around it, hired risk managers and are working with the customers there and the regulator there to now move forward with this launch that we anticipate will happen in March of '15. We just see a lot of demand in Asia. And ICE has grew -- if you look at us, we grew all through the financial crisis, and largely it was because the emerging economies were adopting risk management, and many of them were prepared to come and meet us in Europe to do business. With the uncertainties about European regulation, it's just it's not clear whether or not, to us, Asian customers want to come there, whether they would prefer to meet us in the U.S. or whether they want to meet in Singapore. And so I know that all of this new infrastructure for regulation and reporting and oversight is very, very complicated. And the further away you get from your own domicile, the harder it is to fully comprehend this stuff. And so it's why we really think there's a regional opportunity out there. What business moves that way? It's hard to say, but we want to -- if we're all going to be on the same platform and in the same systems and the same people involved, then I think we can provide that opportunity somewhat seamlessly to the market, and we'll just see where the market takes us. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then my follow-up would be back to Brent, obviously seeing very good momentum. I don't know if you can size what you think is the revenue contribution right now from the arbitrage that's going on with your exchanging it from the competitive payments over to flow. And then, Jeff, if you want to talk about the longer-term adoption of Brent as a benchmark. Do you still think there is pretty good legs on that trend? We've already seen pretty good progress on that. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Yes. It's hard to know what that arbitrage is. We know -- we just look at the markets and people that are in the markets, and we can see behavior that looks like somebody that's trying to get paid by moving trades back and forth on a competitive exchange and then ultimately looking at us as the primary market to figure out where the real price is and laying off, from time to time, that risk back into the primary market, for which we charge full price and benefit. And it really is a transfer of wealth from one company to another. So we try to set it up that way. We try to charge people that way so that we get some net benefit out of what our competitors do. It's not something we can predict. We never know what our competitors are going to do, what schemes they may have. But importantly, we have a pretty close eye on it, and we do monitor trading activity in our markets and adjust our pricing and response accordingly to try to grow revenues, which is really what we're all about here, not necessarily market share. Scott A. Hill: Well, just -- but to kind of put an edge on that point, market share has been pretty stable at about 55% of the total oil anyway. So you talk about the trading schemes and the buy-1-get-3-free-type programs, the reality is the Brent market keeps getting bigger. I think Brent OI now -- our Brent OI is now larger than the OI of the CME's WTI. And so as I look at total share, as I look at the nature of the volumes that we're getting the revenue that it generates, we feel pretty good about where we are in our oil franchise. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. And then just on the longer-term benchmark adoption of Brent that, I think, Jeff, you alluded to earlier? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Yes. Well, one of the things that's going on right now is a consultation in Europe about oil pricing in general and the regulation of benchmarks more broadly. There's going to be some -- there's the consultation going. There's an opportunity for the market to talk to the regulators about the commodities markets, and specifically the oil markets, on the need or lack of need for additional regulation. We're in the business of producing benchmarks now, and we've got the infrastructure to do it and the governance around it and a good relationship with the regulators. We're going to let that process play out. Our customers are going to have a strong say in it. As you regulate benchmarks, you're really pulling in the physical markets, the underlying markets and the transaction in those markets which make up the benchmark. So you're moving regulation further down the chain, and that impacts our customers, so we'll see what their response is. But broadly speaking, we're set up really for however the regulators come out and want us to operate that benchmark. The Brent index is a benchmark that we do set and have set for many, many years internally. And those processes may become more transparent, I suspect, as the nature of benchmark price setting is trending that way generally. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeffrey Sprecher, Chairman and CEO, for any closing remarks. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Well, thank you, Kate, and thank you all for joining us this morning. And we'll look forward to continuing to speak with you throughout the quarter. Have a good day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kelly Loeffler. Ms. Loeffler, please go ahead. Kelly L. Loeffler: Good morning. ICE's fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investor section of the theice.com. These items will be archived, and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2014 Form 10-K, which we filed this morning. In addition to GAAP results, we also refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including adjusted income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted expenses and adjusted EPS. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the GAAP term in the earnings materials, an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful and how management uses these measures. When used on the call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction base expenses. Adjusted net income refers to adjusted income from continuing operations, and adjusted EPS refers to adjusted diluted continuing operations earnings per share. With us on the call are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Chuck Vice, President and Chief Operating Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Scott. Scott A. Hill: Thank you, Kelly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. I'll begin on Slide 4, which highlights our 2014 performance. During 2014, we achieved our ninth consecutive year of record revenues and adjusted earnings. While volume declined 16% over the prior year, net revenues grew 3% on a pro forma basis to $3.1 billion, thanks to growth and trading and listings revenues at the New York Stock Exchange, as well as growth in data services and CDS clearing. In addition, we achieved over 50% of our synergy target by the end of 2014, and adjusted operating margin expanded to 55%. This combination of revenue growth and margin expansion enabled ICE to deliver 15% adjusted earnings growth in 2014 and helped us generate operating cash flows of $1.5 billion, more than double 2013. These record earnings and cash flows combined with the IPO of Euronext enabled us to significantly reduce our leverage, return nearly $1 billion of capital to the shareholders and invest over $0.5 billion in strategic acquisitions. Now let's turn to Slide 5, where I'll briefly highlight our fourth quarter results. Adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter rose 30% to $2.59 per share. Net revenues grew 10% on a pro forma basis to $800 million, including record data services revenues, strong CDS clearing revenues and double-digit growth from our NYSE trading and listings business. Adjusted expenses of $340 million came in below guidance as we continued to realize synergies on an accelerated basis, and adjusted operating margin was 58%. Currency impacts, which are part of running the global business, were negligible, as most of our revenues, and particularly those where we are growing, are dollar denominated. Our tax rate for the quarter on an adjusted basis was 32%, which reflects a larger U.S. profit mix and a few year-end cleanup items that impacted the quarter. As you'll see in our guidance provided in the appendix, we expect the shift to more U.S. profit to result in a 2015 tax rate of 28% to 31%. Let's move to Slide 6, where I'll detail fourth quarter revenues and expenses. On the left side, you can see that net transaction and clearing revenues totaled $479 million. Data services revenues reached a record $174 million, including contribution from SuperDerivatives and ICE Benchmark Administration. Our listings revenue generated a record $95 million, which was up 9% compared to the prior fourth quarter on a pro forma basis. Our U.S. cash and equities options business grew 14% on a pro forma basis to $95 million. Other revenue contributed $52 million in the quarter. You will notice of that we have made changes to the way we report our data listings and other revenues. We have moved data delivery services into the Data Services revenue line, and corporate governance services into the Listings revenue line. We believe these changes provide much greater transparency regarding services closely associated with our data and listings offerings. The current and prior year have been updated to reflect these changes, and additional information is provided in our 10-K. The right side of Slide 6 shows our expense details. Fourth quarter adjusted expenses were $340 million. Compensation and professional services expense each came in lower as we continue to realize the benefits of our integration plans and from our focus on reducing the outside legacy use of contractors and consultants at the NYSE. We also saw some benefit in the fourth quarter from completing the Liffe transition in November and a year-to-date true-up of in FINRA regulation fees. Next, on Slide 7. I'll detail our fourth quarter derivatives performance. Total futures and options revenue was $335 million. While volume declined 11% during the quarter, total revenues grew 7% on a pro forma basis, with Brent revenues up 31%, and natural gas revenues up 5%. The overall revenue growth was enabled by the diversity of our product offering and improved revenue capture across all categories : energy, ags and financials. And importantly, strong trends in open interest continue to cross Brent, other oil, equity derivatives and our non-Euribor rates products through year-end. Brent open interest rose 50% year-to-year to a record 3.8 million contracts. Other oil open interest grew 23% year-to-year. Our non-Euribor interest rate open interest grew 27%, and equity derivatives open interest was up 8% over the prior fourth quarter. Finally, as noted in our January volume release yesterday, volumes across many of our asset classes are solid. We reported monthly ADV records for total energy, Brent and U.K. nat gas futures, as well as WTI options. Our Brent ADV grew 42% due to continued oil price volatility, and we established another OI record at 4.3 million contracts. Other oil volume, which includes WTI, heating oil and RBOB, grew 51% over the prior January. While natural gas ADV was down against the difficult compare, January was the second highest volume performance in the past 10 months. Most importantly, we estimate that January revenues increased versus last year. A strength from data and listings revenue, along with growth in commodity and U.K. rates volume, helped mitigate the impact of Continental European interest rate volume declines. Moving now to Slide 8, I'll walk through our record quarter and OTC clearing. CDS revenues for the year were a record $97 million, an increase of 23% year-over-year. We added several new products, including the Markit iTraxx Senior Financial index and new sovereign instruments. 2014 buyside activity increased 90%, and clearing of European instruments at our U.S. clearinghouse, ICE Clear Credit, rose 124%. In fact, 40% of the $7 trillion of buyside growth notional cleared in 2014 came from European buyside customers clearing through our U.S. CDS clearinghouse. To continue to serve the growing demand we are seeing from European clients given the uncertain European regulatory landscape, we have now expanded the hours of operation in our U.S. clearinghouse to open at 3 a.m. Eastern Time. We believe the breadth of products that we uniquely offer and the capital efficiency that we provide via our portfolio margin and capabilities will continue to attract global CDS customers to our U.S. clearinghouse. Slide 9 reflects the strong performance of the New York Stock Exchange. We generated cash trading revenue of $188 million in 2014, an increase of 6% compared to the previous year on a pro forma basis. And importantly, our market share has notably strengthened and our revenue capture has increased. In addition, we continue to work to enhance the efficiency of our equities trading business by rationalizing the 5 technology platforms on which our exchanges operate. I'll also note that NYSE's trading volume was up 19% year-to-year in January. The lower left chart at the bottom of Slide 9 reflects the New York Stock Exchange's fourth year of leadership in global listings. For 2014, we had a record 129 IPOs, and we led in technology IPOs through the third consecutive year. In aggregate, our customers raised $183 billion in total global proceeds on the New York Stock Exchange, which is more than the next 2 exchanges combined. The NYSE's hybrid market model and transparent IPO platform continue to attract global companies of all sizes and industries. Across data, listings and trading, the New York Stock Exchange is growing and proving its operational efficiency in generating significant cash. I'll walk through expense synergies on Slide 10. On this slide, you can see an updated time line on expense synergy realization. We realized nearly $290 million or well over 50% of our targeted synergies as of the end of 2014. This was largely due to the seamless integration of our 2 companies, the divestiture of noncore businesses and an accelerated reduction of contractors and outsourced services during the fourth quarter. In 2015, we expect to realize another $110 million to $115 million in synergies as a result of the completion of the Liffe transition and continued efforts to complete the integration of NYSE corporate operations. We expect to enter 2016 on a run rate at or in excess of $450 million in synergies, and we have a clear path to achieve the total $550 million of synergies entering 2017 as we deploy the NYSE technology platform and finalize the consolidation of our real estate footprint. Our expense guidance at the top of Slide 10 reflects the 2015 incremental $110 million to $115 million in synergies offset by roughly $20 million to $25 million in investments in the core business. In addition to reducing our existing expense base by roughly $90 million, we will add $40 million to $45 million in expenses related to our recent acquisitions. These expenses will be more than offset by incremental revenues of $50 million to $55 million. We have provided additional guidance in the appendix of this presentation. I'll wrap up my remarks on Slide 11 with an update on our strong cash flows and capital structure. Operating cash flows grew to a record $1.5 billion in 2014. At December 31, we had over $650 million in net unrestricted cash and short-term investments. Total net debt was $3.2 billion, and our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA was 1.7x. We used our strong cash generation during 2014 to reduce our debt by nearly $2 billion for strategic growth investments and to return nearly $1 billion to shareholders, including roughly $300 million in dividends and over $640 million in share repurchases. Our share repurchases continued in January. And this morning, we announced the first quarter dividend of $0.65 per share. Uniquely in our sector, we have consistently presented our return on invested capital alongside our earnings and cash measures, because we believe it is an important indicator of value creation. As we averaged in the full impact of the NYSE acquisition during 2014, our ROIC reached its nadir at 6.5%. We are committed to generating revenue growth in a lower expense base to increase our ROIC above our cost of capital by 2016 and then to more traditional levels over time. 2014 was a year of integration during which we accelerated the pace of synergy realization, grew earnings double digits, generated record operating cash flows and advanced our growth initiatives. That momentum will carry over into 2015 as we generate $100 million in incremental organic revenue solely from our data and listings offerings, even while we reduced our expense base by approximately $90 million, excluding acquisitions. That, together with the incremental profits we will generate on investments in our strategic acquisitions, auspicious January revenues and our vigilant focus on the needs of our customers in an evolving regulatory environment, gives us confidence that we will once again generate double-digit earnings growth and strong returns for our shareholders during 2015. I'll be happy to answer any questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll hand the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Thank you, Scott, and good morning to everybody on the call. We're pleased to report these strong results today, which are what we've committed to do as a growth company. Our earnings growth in the fourth quarter and for all of 2014 outperformed that of the S&P 500. This demonstrates how we've evolved our business to ensure that we remain levered to long-term growth trends. We are well diversified, and we continue to invest for futures earnings growth by serving our global customers through clearing, capital raising, liquid markets and data services. We've done this alongside the aggressive operating objectives to grow and integrate, to drive value for our customers and our shareholders. On Slide 12, you can see that we achieved our strategic objectives for 2014. This was an ambitious set of initiatives that required significant resources and organizational change. For example, our teams across technology, regulation, sales and operations worked with the industry over the last year to transition the Liffe exchange to ICE Futures Europe. This milestone allowed us to streamline our markets and get closer to new customers. And we immediately began building out our capabilities in our new complex of Liffe futures markets across rates, soft commodities and equity derivatives. Moving now to Slide 13. We've laid out 5 of the areas that we believe will enable us to again deliver double-digit earnings growth in 2015. We have a strong track record of improving the performance of acquired businesses, as you can see in our results today. We curated businesses acquired from NYSE by shedding low margin parts of their technology division while strengthening their core listings, trading and data operations. This means that we expect to realize both efficiencies and revenue opportunities, enabling us to grow through a range of trading volume environments. Our opportunities set spans a number of high-quality areas, ranging from a significant lowering of our expense base, to upside in our markets for energy, agriculture and financials. That, alongside our growing and predictable listings and data services businesses, creates meaningful earnings growth opportunities over the near and long term. I also want to note some areas that are impacting our customers which primarily relate to ongoing regulatory reform. Where our customers face challenges, we see opportunities to help them meet their regulatory requirements in an innovative and capital-efficient manner. An example of this was our response to the need for swaps clearing in the credit markets during the financial crisis. This is now nearly a $100 million a year business for us. The paths of global regulatory reform are diverging, and this continues to reinforce our model. In 2009, under the IOSCO framework, countries agreed to implement consistent regulations that would prevent regulatory arbitrage and address those imbalances in regulation that contributed to the financial crisis. 5 years later, for example, there still remains a divergence between the U.S. and Europe. This is why our customers are telling us that the ability and capability of jurisdictional options for trading and clearing is increasingly important, and why you've seen ICE, as well as other major exchange and clearing groups, investing in multiple regions. And as Scott highlighted in his remarks, right now, cleared swaps positions are migrating from Europe to the U.S. I believe that Asia will be the next clearing magnet. And alongside with ICE Clear Singapore, you're seeing the other major exchange groups following us in that direction. The impacts of increasing regulatory constraints with Dodd-Frank, EMIR, Basel and bank capital rules, paired with the economic challenges of the Eurozone, create uncertainty that drive the need to hedge. And you could see that in our foreign exchange markets during the month of January, where volume was up 93%. I'd now like to provide more detail on a few of ICE's 2015 growth initiatives beginning on Slide 14. First, our leading crude oil markets. The ICE Brent contract recorded its 18th consecutive year of record futures and options volume. When we acquired the International Petroleum Exchange in year 2001, we had an approximate 30% market share in global crude oil futures trading. Today, we've grown market share to 54%, and we've accomplished this despite aggressive payments for trading volume being made by competitors. In the fourth quarter, ICE Brent's open interest surpassed that of NYMEX's WTI for the first time in the contract's 27-year history. Our oil markets continue to benefit from strong, long-term secular trends towards hedging and risk management, which have overwhelmed the cyclical headwinds year-after-year. And the moves in the price of crude in recent months again demonstrate the central role that our markets help manage price risk, whether prices are rising or are falling. Based on the forward price curve for December 2015 delivery, Brent futures prices are over 15% above today's prompt month prices. However, there are still many in the market today that believe oil prices could decline by this same percentage. These divergent views suggest that the only consensus is an expectation that crude prices will remain volatile. And there are number of factors that point to Brent's ability to continue its long-term growth trend. First, open interest is at record levels and rising. Continued economic and geopolitical uncertainty is causing global participants to continuously reside -- revise their oil price expectations. And secular trends towards hedging, including ICE's broad range of 400-related oil contracts, position us for continued leadership in the global energy markets. In January, Brent volume was up 42% year-over-year and our Brent options business continued its growth, in fact, just yesterday, setting another volume record. Our Brent open interest reached a new record, up 10% from the end of December. And finally, we completed the transition of the distillate market to our new gas oil specification in January, providing a greater range of hedging opportunity for more market participants. In January, our gas oil daily volume increased 9% year-over-year. Moving on to Slide 15. I'll provide more detail on our global natural gas trading and clearing activities which, in 2014, comprised about 6% of our total revenues. When we acquired the Endex exchange in 2013, we anticipated the move toward more exchange trading and clearing of European natural gas products. This has, in fact, materialized, as shown in the revenue chart on the right side of the slide. Our natural gas revenue increased 5% during the fourth quarter of 2014 as a result of the rising demand for exchange trading and clearing in European markets. We continue to launch new products and now cover natural gas markets in 4 countries in Europe, with more to come in 2015. Our North American natural gas markets have a strong base of participants, and we recently announced 6 new products there. There's increasing work in Congress this year on the potential for more exports of U.S. natural gas in the form of LNG and could be as soon as late 2015. So we continue to position ourselves for the globalization of the natural gas markets. Moving now to Slide 16. I'll update you on our European rates complex. The near 0 interest rate levels in the Eurozone impacted the volatility and volume of our Euribor contract, particularly in the second half of the year. The acquisition of its flagship contract, which accounted for only about 4% of our 2014 revenue, however, has facilitated our rapid expansion into broader areas of interest rate trading and clearing. We continue to grow our U.K. interest rate complex, including short Sterling, where daily volume grew 10% and open interest rose 34% during 2014. Similarly, volume for our U.K. Gilt contract increased 30%, and open interest increased 10% over the prior year. So on Slide 17, you can see how we're leveraging our leading European interest rate position to build out a broad complex for risk management. Last spring, we introduced 20 new futures contracts, which enable us to cover more durations and more geographies. Our products and services in the interest rate space continue to evolve as we introduced customer-driven solutions during this dynamic monetary policy landscape, and we hold a strong position to serve these markets as expectation for rates moves merry -- vary, excuse me. Moving to Slide 18. I'll provide more details on our comprehensive data services business. By combining ICE's data business with the data business that we acquired and reorganized from NYSE, Liffe and SuperDerivatives, we've increased the markets that we cover. Together with our organic expansion in the provision of regulated benchmarks with ICE Benchmark Administration, we're building a powerful financial information footprint that leverages the strength of our markets, customer distribution and technology. In the fourth quarter, 40% of ICE's revenues were generally recurring, as you saw on Slide 6. This is up from just 11% in 2011. As the demand for high quality, low-cost data services rises, we're well-positioned to grow alongside of this macro trend. ICE Benchmark Administration, which launched 1 year ago today with the supervision of LIBOR. More recently, ICE Benchmark Administration took over the management of the ISDAFIX benchmark. And in March, we'll begin establishing the gold price. We're investing the redesign and retool of these global benchmarks, which have trillions of dollars of assets tied to them. And we're working with the industry to develop technology-driven processes to strengthen the confidence and transparency of a growing range of flagship benchmarks, upon which businesses and consumers can rely. Our recent SuperDerivatives acquisition was particularly strategic. It not only provided us with a rich set of OTC data and analytics, but brought to us a specialized data team that strengthens our competencies for clearing complex financial products. The SuperDerivatives desktop affords us a unique platform for growth, given the already widely accepted WebICE platform, on which our markets are delivered each day. Couple this with the thousands of companies that we touch for trading, clearing and listings, and you have a powerful and deep customer base for those that we are trying to tailor our new data services. I'll finish my prepared remarks on Slide 19, with the chart that reflects the results of our team. By bringing innovative solutions to the challenges faced by our industry, ICE has consistently delivered growth in earnings, regardless of the business cycle, for every year that we've been a public company. Long-term ICE shareholders and employees have benefited from the 19% compound annual growth in earnings that our vision and execution have delivered. Today, we operate 11 exchanges, our global data services business, the preeminent equity listings franchise and 6 clearinghouses with our 7th clearinghouse launching later this year. This footprint provides us with flexibility when considering our customer's global needs, as is illustrated by the way that we've been able to respond to clearing business moving from Europe due to regulatory differences and potential clearing capital increases there. We reacted by simply altering our strategic investments in our established global outpost. This validates our flexible global model and informs us on how we approach 2015 and beyond. I also want to note the strong progress at the NYSE, the flagship exchange for raising global capital and equity trading. For example, last week, we hosted Shake Shack for their very successful IPO. As an entrepreneur, I know firsthand that these are seminal moments for individuals and companies. This is why we continue to work on market structure reform to improve the environment for capital markets growth on behalf of companies and their investors. And importantly, for ICE's investors, we're proud to highlight the strong contribution that this business is now delivering as a result of our efforts to create efficiencies and optimize areas that continue to have strong potential while generating meaningful U.S.-based cash flow. We have significant strategic and operational accomplishments in 2014, completing 4 acquisitions, returning nearly $1 billion to our shareholders, reducing nearly $2 billion in net debt and realizing expense synergies on an aggressive time line. But we're not finished, and we have many work streams underway to continue the evolution of our business. We're in an unparalleled position to meet the rising demand for capital-efficient risk management, capital raising, data distribution and new product development around the world. On behalf of everyone at ICE, I'd like to thank our customers for trusting us with their business and for collaborating with us on their evolving requirements during a very dynamic time. I'll now ask our operator, Keith, to conduct the question-and-answer session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : I guess, Jeff, I got to congratulate you. Last time, when -- last quarter's call, oil was going through -- crude oil was going through $80 and we talked about whether that was good or bad and you emphasized the volatility side and it's certainly playing out in volumes now. But I guess I'll update the question. As oil, it's highly volatile, but it's now at $50, and I know you spent a fair amount in the prepared remarks, but does that -- the question continues to come up, does a low oil price, is it going to dampen hedging demand? Or is it offset by the volatility you've spoken about last quarter? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Thanks for the question, Rich. I believe that we're going to go through a really volatile time here based on talking to our customers, particularly many of the drilling and integrated oil firms trying to figure out the dynamic for the next few years. So we see a strong volatility ahead which should drive volume growth. I think underpinning your question is a concern that price in U.S. natural gas has been at historically low levels and volumes on ICE are reduced in the U.S., and I think people sort of somehow try to correlate that. But what many don't recognize is that the U.S. natural gas business is really a regulated business where the end product, natural gas, goes through local distribution companies that are regulated or electric utilities to make electric power, which are regulated, and have the ability to pass through costs, in many cases, to their customers. And therefore, only hedged when there is extreme volatility and work with their Public Utility Commissions to come up with a program that they know that can be passed through. That is very different than the oil industry, where oil products become petroleum fuels, chemicals, other things that go into the free market. And therefore, the supply chain all along there has gotten used to hedging. And in fact, we continue to see increased hedging activity to the point that Scott Hill and I have been meeting with senior managements of consumer-driven firms that here before hadn't hedged and actually, even at the senior level, want to talk about how to do that. So we see great differences between the oil business and the natural gas business, which I think caused us some of that concern. Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : Got it. Understood. The volumes have been certainly super strong here to date this year. I guess, and my one follow-up, and this would be more for Scott, I guess. You're guiding to significant growth in data services and listing revenue. And could you be, I guess, or could you quantify the contribution from benchmark, ICE Benchmark Administration, Scott? Because that -- is that the significant driver here? Scott A. Hill: No, Rich. It is a significant driver, but it's not the significant driver. If you look across the data business, it's really a multitude of factors that's driving it. It's more customers, it's us continuing to add different products and different information that our customers want to buy, to package that information up in a way that creates more value for those customers, value that they're willing to pay us for. The ICE Benchmark is clearly a part of it and is embedded in that $100 million increase. And then on top of that, the $50 million or $55 million I talked about from acquisitions, the large part of that, in fact, the vast majority of that is SuperDerivatives. So if you look at our data line, there are any number of growth avenues that are embedded in that. And it's one of the reasons why we went ahead and put the guidance out there because we're very confident that with the additional customers, the growth in ICE Benchmark, the contribution from SuperDerivatives, that particular revenue line is going to generate significant growth for us this year. Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : And the $100 million I thought excluded SuperDerivatives. And maybe the question is what percentage of the $100 million growth in that line comes from -- will come from, ballpark, from ICE Benchmark? Scott A. Hill: Yes. Again, I'm not going to get into the specifics on ICE Benchmark, Rich. But to be clear, the $100 million is organic, and then on top of that is the $50 million to $55 million from the acquisitions. Operator : And the next question comes from Chris Onwugbolu with Credit Suisse. Chinedu Christian Onwugbolu - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : So my question is on regulation. On capital requirement, I do appreciate it's difficult to quantify since all the rules are not clear. But it will be useful to get maybe a ballpark estimate in terms of how you think about requirements with things like EMIR compliance, possible skin in the game as we look into 2015 cash uses. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: This is Jeff. Let me first take the high-level answer and then -- and layout sort of our thinking on it, then Scott can give you the details and clean up my answer, frankly. But there are 2 -- you mentioned EMIR. And what's happening in the market is there are 2 clearing models that seem to be evolving. There's a clearing model that EMIR legislation is driving towards in Europe, which is a different model than the model that will exist everywhere else in the world. And those models had -- are ultimately are going to result in 2 different choices for customers and 2 different capital strategies. Starting with Europe, Europe is moving towards more open access to clearinghouses and towards a model that used to exist where capital was provided by a group of banks that largely were intermediaries in transactions that we're happy to provide their balance sheet to their customers because they were monetizing the bid offer spread in other ways of serving their customers. So balance sheet went into these utility-oriented clearinghouses. The EMIR legislation is on a collision course with the implementation of Basel rules and other bank capital rules around the world, and we don't believe that those bank balance sheets are going to be available in the way they were in the past. That then suggests -- and frankly, the banks are becoming increasingly more an agency model, not capturing the bid offer spread as their proprietary business is, due to regulatory reasons, shed. So that means that capital in those clearinghouses are going to have to come from 1 of 2 places, either the owner of the clearinghouse or the end-user. As an owner of those kinds of utility clearinghouses, ICE shareholders are not going to put capital at risk for business that is brought by competitors. And our competitors are not going to put capital at risk for business that is brought by ICE. Shareholders are not going to co-mingle their capital bases to help competitors, which means that, ultimately, the capital in Europe is going to largely come from the end-users. Now Europe recognizes this and has provided under EMIR for more segregated accounts. That means that an end-user will be asked to basically put money in a segregated account which will back their positions. And as they do that, what we're going to find is that the large institutional fund managers are not going to be able to mutualize their individual funds with other manager's funds. So we will be putting into place positions where fund managers will have to capitalize, significantly capitalize individual accounts in order to be able to trade. Europe believes that, that's a good idea and that there will be more choice in how to trade. And I guess that they believe that end-users are willing to pay a lot more for that privilege. Outside of Europe, you have the same dynamic with the banks. We all relied on bank balance sheets for many, many years, but those balance sheets are also becoming constrained. And so what you've seen is ICE and our competitors have put more skin in the game. We have -- ICE really started this when we built our first clearinghouse in 2007, when we put money in the default fund that sits in front of the default fund. And when you go through the mechanics of bank capital charges, what you'll find is that if we sit in front of them, we dramatically reduce the charges that they have to take to contribute. And so what you've seen is, over time, ICE has increased capital going into our clearinghouses and many of our competitors have, too, and it's put relief in the system for bank balance sheets. I suspect that, that is not over. We haven't fully seen the impact of all of the bank capital rules. Banks right now are going through another round of internal analysis as they have more clarity in the rules and then, clearly, you're going to have 2017 come into effect. So outside of Europe, what we've seen is, frankly, we offer segregation in Europe right now. And what we have seen and what we have highlighted on the charts here is that our European customers don't really want to put that capital up and have preferred to move their positions out of Europe to the U.S. or elsewhere. And as I've said in my prepared remarks, we are rapidly building also in Asia, and I believe that Asia will be a magnet. We've seen one of our competitors building a Hong Kong clearinghouse, another one of our competitors also building a Singapore clearinghouse. So you're going to see this magnet that's going to pull positions also to Asia. I don't think our shareholders should be particularly concerned about this. The return on invested capital that should we put more money into a default fund will be significant. It will attract business, and these are growth areas for us and they're areas that we're happy to invest in. One of the things that Scott put in his prepared remarks is that we now open our U.S. clearinghouse for OTC swaps at 3 :00 in the morning. That's an additional investment that we made in infrastructure, in personnel, in technology, because we're seeing non-U.S. business want to have access to that clearinghouse because of the kinds of investment that we're making. And it really is attracting flow. So we look forward to high ROIC returns from these businesses. Scott A. Hill: The only thing, Christian, I'd very quickly add is the regulatory capital required is not uncertain at all. We know exactly what that is. It's disclosed in our K. It's probably another $130 million or $140 million that we're going to put into ICE Clear Europe from a regulatory capital standpoint. And that's it, and that's accounted for. And then the point to Jeff to the extent we determine that it's appropriate to invest more in our guaranteed fund, which we're certainly are looking at, that again is not anything that gives me any concerns with regards to our overall capital. And I don't think it will restrict us from doing some of the other things that we've been doing in terms of capital returns. Chinedu Christian Onwugbolu - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Yes. No, I'm clear on the EMIR one. I was -- I'm actually more looking for some sort of thoughts in terms of numbers for the Guaranty Fund. But I hear you guys loud and clear, and thanks for the very, very detailed response. My follow-up question is really on the NYSE business. Just given all the changes you are proposing, Jeff, to market structure, the real strength in the listings business, technology rationalization. Curious as to where you think operating margins for that business can now ultimately get to? And then secondly, a follow-up on that would be just strategically, how important is this business to the very long-term future of ICE? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: It's a good question. I'm not going to give you a specific target. But I think people will be surprised that we really believe the NYSE cash equities business can operate at very high operating margins. And I think we, in fairness, the market watched NYSE and its other U.S. competitor lose market share over a period of time and have to change their business models. But we now see market share growing, we see the trends increasing. And we're putting up a business underneath that, an operational business underneath that, that will deliver very, very high returns. We can see it already. It's already -- it already really improved our performance in the last part of 2014. We're projecting even more for '15 and '16. One of the things if you look at the circular chart that Scott laid out on Slide 6, where we show our breakup of revenue, you'll see that what we have really built over the last year or 2 inside ICE is a very, very big data distribution business, to the point that about 40% of our revenues are no longer variable revenues. These are high-value recurring revenues, predictable, where, I believe, we are really providing interesting things and have some pricing power and the ability to massively expand our distribution into that space. And certainly, data and offshoots of the NYSE, you can see is contributed in there. So we'll -- we want you to monitor that business. We're certainly investing in it. It's why we bought SuperDerivatives, for example. And we'll be rolling out more products and services over the next few years in that area. And I think that will help determine how strategic these businesses are for us. Operator : And the next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Since we're on the topic of EMIR, I believe 2015 represents mandatory clearing obligations for certain interest rate swaps. And I think interest rates swap clearing made it into Slide 13. So a couple of questions on it. I guess, first, is it possible to give us your view on sizing the opportunity? I guess, what I'm looking for is for ICE and given the competitive nature of interest rate swap clearing, can this be a bigger business than the credit swap business for you, again it's over time? And then second, just where do we stand on developing and executing your strategy to clear interest rate swaps? And are there any milestones that you can share for us in terms of interest rate clearing? Anything that you have for goals for '15 or '16 or '17 that's worth sharing. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: That's a tough question. First of all, we haven't announced anything along those lines. So -- is the short answer. But what we are doing is we have rolled out a number of futures products that we think will attract standardized business that we think can be listed and that can replace much of what was done in the swaps world, including our acquisition of the Irish patent abilities -- capabilities to launch interest rate swaps in Europe based on that as well as credit swaps. So you've seen -- we have a number of swap futures products, and what you've seen us do so far is to use our current infrastructure, our current delivery mechanisms and our current customer base to bring more products along that capability. I've mentioned that, in my prepared remarks that we bought SuperDerivatives, which really has an amazing employee pool that understands very, very complex derivatives, and we've been working with them to try to figure out how best to utilize their expertise in our clearing houses. I think, over time, to answer your question about competition, clearing houses that really have invested in the ability to model and see risk and manage risk to the benefit of the end users that pass muster with the regulators and our board and shareholder base are going to be big winners, and that's what you've seen us investing in over the last few years. And so I think that the growth trend around that will continue. Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Is it a big opportunity? Like, should we be focusing there? Like it seems like, again, it was -- it kind of slipped into Slide 13. Like, you were early in credit, you dominate credit, it's a big revenue generator. Can we be -- can things be as good for you in interest rate swaps eventually as they are for you in credit swaps over time? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Well, the interest rate market is huge and complex and touches all kinds of -- actually, there's all kinds of submarkets within the interest rate market. But right now, we're living in the Western world, in a 0 interest rate environment, for all intents and purposes, in some cases, negative interest rate environment. Nobody needs to hedge negative interest rates. And so what -- the size of that market is going to be very, very much driven by monetary policy. But I think I've mentioned on this call before that one of the things that happens in the low interest rate environment is that people borrow money and they put it to work in all kinds of different places, and it's very hard to know where it's going. And when interest rates do rise, and I suspect they will eventually rise here, people that have invested in low interest rate activities are going to want to hedge those out quickly. And I think you'll see a dramatic rise. In fact, here in the U.S. interest rate environment there -- it's been incredibly active, even though it's very, very unclear what our monetary policy in the U.S. is really going to be. But just the prospect that it might change has really gotten tremendous volumes, volumes that in many cases are bigger than 2007 top of the market kind of volumes. So I think these are big opportunities, at the right moment in time, with the right products set, and that's what we have been spending a lot of time with the pretty sophisticated group now that we have, analyzing and trying to position ourselves for. Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : And for the follow up, Scott, for listings revenue, it was up a bunch. Did 4Q include pricing changes, or did the pricing changes not kick in until 2015? Scott A. Hill: The pricing changes will start on January 1. But, Ken, I would point out that a lot of the revenue growth in listings is really about the great listings year we had last year and the number of wins that we had. You saw it in the fourth quarter, as you said, tremendous fourth quarter really based on that performance. And as we roll into next year, that's the bigger factor, the far more relevant factor that's going drive revenue growth as you move through next year -- or this year, sorry. Operator : And the next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Back to the oil topic for a second. So, Jeff, thanks for the commentary around volatility. All of that makes sense. I think the one interesting point here is, of course, growth in the open interest that we've seen in the oil franchise, even year-to-date up massively. Can you speak a little bit about the source of the growth in the open interest if you guys have seen a noticeable shift between the top of users that have come in to the market now versus, let's say, a year ago? And how sticky do you think this is going to be amid this kind of volatility back drop? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: It's a good question. We have really targeted our energy business at commercial users, and so the growth in open interest has really been commercially-oriented. And we found that, that businesses is very, very sticky. I mean, those -- the commercial uses are the ultimate hedgers and so they hold open interest and then they manage those positions over the long term as things change. And so we're really in a very luxurious position with respect to that particular franchise and how we've taken it to market and the results that we've seen in these volatile periods. It's partly why our market share in the global oil market is up, frankly. And [indiscernible]. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : It doesn't sound like a major mix shift change there. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: No. Correct. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. Now a follow-up for Scott. There's a lot of concerns in the market place regarding your guys' foreign exchange and currency translation exposure. It doesn't seem like it really made a difference in the fourth quarter despite the stronger dollar. But maybe talk a little bit about how we should think about it for 2015 on a pretax income basis. If the dollar continues to strengthen against the euro and other currencies, how much is hedged, how much is not? What would be the impact? Scott A. Hill: Yes, look, I think that concern was way overblown. And I think it remains way overblown. As you saw in the quarter, it was almost a nonissue, effectively was a nonissue, and the pound only was down 2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and the year a little bit more than that. As I said in my prepared remarks, we are predominantly a dollar-based revenue company. We do have, clearly, some euro and pound exposures, but at the end of the day, it's very small in the scheme of things. And to the extent we've got balance sheet risk, of course, we hedge those, to the extent we've got the euro notes, of course, that's naturally hedged with the euros we set aside to prepay it. So it was a nonissue in the quarter. I suspect it will be a nonissue through the year. And the reality is it's a part of earning the global business. But to the extent that there is a significant move one way or the other, we've just got to manage through it and work our expense base to deliver the profit, and that's what we intend to do. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Maybe another way to think about it at a high level, the way that I think about it, is that the commodity business around the world is largely dollar denominated, and we just decided years ago to put our commissions in dollars. When we bought the Liffe exchange, which is a British exchange, it's located in the U.K., and it had both euro and pound-denominated contracts, but because it was located in U.K., for many of its European currencies, it charged commission in pounds even if the currency was in a different. And we have expenses in pounds because we're still operating a large European business. So we're a very, very dollar-denominated company. Operator : And the next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Scott, just on the guidance that you gave. I think it's on both, I would say, capital and expenses. Just wanted to get a sense. When you think about capital deployment in 2015 and even '16, like the balance that we've been seeing in terms of the buybacks, the dividend, acquisitions, it's still like a good mix. And then in terms of the acquisitions that you gave as the revenue and expenses that are coming on in the fourth quarter, just wanted to get a sense, it seems like the margins are a little low in that business. When we think about it over the next couple of years, is it a revenue growth opportunity? Are there any synergies related to these acquisitions. I just wanted to see where those margins will shake out. Scott A. Hill: Yes, both good questions. So the first answer with regards to the capital deployment mix, I do think that thinking about it, consistent with what you've seen in the past, is the right way to think about it. And so I think you're exactly right on that. With regards to the profitability of the acquisitions, the one thing I would note is, as Jeff alluded to, we've got a terrific base of employees that came to us due to the SuperDerivatives acquisition. A number of them are working on initiatives that are going to show up outside of the acquisitions themselves, whether it's work on additional clearing that will generate revenues, et cetera. So I don't think you can look at the value of those businesses strictly in the expenses and revenues that are directly related to those businesses, you have to look at our overall revenues and the value it'll bring as we deploy the resources across the broader revenue opportunity we see. Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. That's helpful. An then, Jeff, you kind of hit on this, but just getting back to oil. I think there's -- some of the pushback that we end up getting is that when oil is at $100 there was a big reason for users to hedge, and at $50, maybe there's less of a reason. It seems like the data isn't backing that. And if you're someone that's running any type of a corporation that needs to hedge oil, it probably doesn't matter, meaning if it's at $50, more power, too. I mean, it can lock in at this price. I just want to get your sense when you're talking to the users, is that risk management, change with where the price is? Or is it still a constant battle, meaning they're constantly trying to manage their business, hedge what they can protect versus what they have less control on. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: That's a good question, but you always have to remember, there's 2 sides in every trade. And so as oil prices are falling, you have producers that want to lock in higher prices for sales before they fall, and are in the market with their marketing people aggressively trying to do that. The producers are making investments and, often times, have to hedge them in order to get financing and make a longer-term commitment. So you have both -- you have pressure on both sides to lock in prices, and that creates the natural tension that then creates the price discovery process. But long story short, there just -- every time there's volatility, it's -- to me, it's like a hurricane that goes through Florida. After the hurricane goes through, people think about buying home owner insurance and -- when they rebuild their house. And every time there's volatility to the upside and to the down side, both sides of that equation, both buyer and seller think about, after high-volatility periods, that maybe they should lock some in and that's, to a certain degree, what you see going on here. And it looks to us like we're going to be in a pretty volatile environment, you can turn on the TV and -- or read the press and you can see pundits talking about their predictions of where oil prices are going to go in '15, '16 and '17 already, and based on the politics of the oil business. Operator : And the next question comes from Alex Kramm of UBS. Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : I can't believe, but I'm going to fit in one more oil question, if it's okay. I think you answered a lot of different topics. But one more, perhaps, when you think about the price of oil and maybe like the investments that we've seen over the last decade or so, I think some folks have argued that what we're seeing right now is certainly a flushing out of some firms that have built up a lot, invested a lot and maybe they won't survive. So I'm just wondering if you're worried yourself about the investment cycle being maybe over for a little bit and maybe some firms that had been contributing to your core commercial growth going away or not contributing the same kind of growth over time, outside of volatility, obviously being very good right now. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Yes, the way I'm thinking about it, which is a lay person, is that the more I talk to our customers, the more I've learned that the fracking wells that have really been responsible in the United States for this tremendous resource that we have, have a very short life. They degrade very, very quickly. And it is not uncommon for wells to only last 18 months. And so capacity, as -- and from the first day that the well starts, they're degrading. So it's almost a given under that circumstance that you're going to see capacity coming out of the market pretty quickly in the United States. And as you do that, supply and demand will change its balance and, theoretically, prices may go up. And so these are not oil wells like I grew up with, where Jed Clampett took a gun and shot it at the ground and oil came bubbling out, and had a geyser that went straight up in the air. This is very -- oil is hard to get out of the ground and degrades quickly and needs constant reinvestment. So it will interesting to watch how the market readjusts. In that regard, that's why I think you see the forward pricing curve that I mentioned already on the move up for future oil prices. Scott A. Hill: When the forward pricing curves up, open interest out, and as Jeff said earlier, our customer mix, we don't really see any big differences. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: The other interesting just side note to that is that one of the benefits that we've had in the U.S. is very low natural gas prices, which also come from fracking. A lot of that natural gas is natural gas that's associated with oil fracking. It's not drillers that went looking for natural gas, it's drillers that went looking for oil and they get natural gas associated with it, and they basically were pumping the gas out at low prices in order to get at high-priced oil. So the symbiotic nature of associated natural gas with oil is something that will also be interesting to watch to see whether there's price volatility in the U.S. natural gas markets. Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : All right, great. And then maybe just to shift topics here for a second. The ICE-Liffe integration, can you just talk a little bit more about, I mean, it seems like it's basically done, but maybe talk a little bit about how customers have reacted to it. I think the Liffe platforms, there were multiple platforms, now you have one platform, different customers, I mean, have you seen any benefits in terms of existing users on the ICE platform, perhaps trying some of the -- trading some of the interest rate products? Do you see any revenue benefits in the near term from what you've done here? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: It's a very good question. You're exactly right in that basically, ICE, the Liffe business was subsumed into the ICE exchange and is on all the ICE platform. But before we could do that merger we had to build out a lot of new technology in the ICE platform that users of the Liffe market had gotten too used to, that did not exist in our other markets. And so what we've done as a result of that have built out a lot more capabilities and flexibilities in the ICE matching engine and trading platform, that we now have the opportunity to look at other markets and think about, \"Okay, we've got this kind of interesting thing that we've built. Where else can it be deployed?\" So the real benefit that we're talking about internally is the technology benefit that was something that we probably would have not built on our own. We are seeing cross-pollinization (sic) [ pollination ]. We are going -- there are traders in the world that chase volatility regardless of asset class. There are people that can price options once they understand the data on the underlying, regardless of what the underlying is. And so what you've seen us do is cross-pollinate our customer base, filled out our data set and historical data so that we can provide option traders that we know with information so they can back test and try option strategies in new markets. So there's a lot of that going on right now. And where are markets where there is not a lot of volatility, there are traders that have largely been sitting on their hands, and those are traders that we've been targeting to bring over to our other markets. Operator : And the next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : First question, kind of a big picture one on volumes. Your business, like all the exchanges, has a lot of noise quarter-to-quarter, even year-to-year given volatility and so forth. But if we just step back and think about the true organic growth of your franchise from a volume perspective, what do you think that number really is and what do you think would be kind of a realistic target to think about? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: I guess, I would push you to Slide 19, which is the earnings per share that the company has delivered for a decade. And that's how we run the business. We don't run the business for volume, never have. I don't like it. In fact, there are some articles out today about us where we have shed some volume in our U.S. options -- equity options market that was not producing positive returns for us. We don't want negative volumes. We don't want to buy volumes. And we don't care about volumes. We only care about earnings. And so what we have done is we have followed customer trends on where to position ourselves, and increasingly, what you're seeing is that there's a range of services that we're providing, including 40% of our business that is not even volume-centric anymore to customers. So I would say to you that the objectives that I'm held to by our board, that trickles down to everybody that's sitting with me in this room is that we are targeting double-digit earnings growth for our shareholders. And we do that by finding ways of serving customers, whether it's volume or not, whether it's positive volume or negative volume, we're doing -- making earnings grow. And I don't know what more to say other than we've got a very strong track record of doing that, and that's how we're motivated around here. Scott A. Hill: Well, to just tie a bow around that, volumes were down 16% last year, but revenue was up 3% and EPS were up 15%. If you look at our guidance, we basically guided you to an incremental $200 million of profit right off the top, which is double-digit earnings again. So it's just that that's the measure to which we hold ourselves and that's the measure to which investors ought to hold us. Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Yes, I mean, no question, you guys have a great record of the earnings growth. Quick follow-up on the interest rate complex. QE, in Europe, just announced, we've seen kind of volumes and open interest decline heading into that. As we sit here today, do you guys think where the current volumes are is kind factoring a lot of that in? Or could potentially we see a bit of another leg down as QEs is formally launched now? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: What's interesting is that the -- we look at our European business, it's the euro-denominated business that's been impacted. The sterling-denominated business in the U.K., for example, has really grown. So -- and if you look at our euro-denominated business as a percent of the revenue of this company, it's very small. So we are positioning ourselves for QE changes that add volatility that we think we can grow from what is a very low revenue base for us. So it's important to us. But whether it happens in '15, '16, '17 or '18, we can't predict and it's not necessarily particularly relevant to the downside. Operator : And the next question comes from Niamh Alexander with KBW. Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : I guess I wanted to go back to the options a little bit, Jeff. Because I was -- and I'm not sure even if it's 4%, 5% of your earnings not even, the equity options, but the market share has been declining. And is it something that used to be that the New York Stock Exchange would have wanted to be like one of the top 3 options exchanges? Is the view different now? If it's not, a significant profits contributor that you're not necessarily too concerned about being one of the biggest in the industry in that space? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Yes, thanks for the question, Niamh. When we bought the company, there was a deal in place that had negative capture and -- but good market share. And we're just not interested in negative capture business. It's standing on the corner and handing out $5 bills of your shareholders' money, and that's not what we do here. And there are others that are interested in negative capture businesses. And as I think I said before, we're more than happy to send our money-losing businesses to our competitors. They don't even have to steal them. We will -- if they just call us, we'll arrange an elegant transfer to them. And so this is a very calculated market share change on our part. This is not, while it's being discovered, I think, by people writing about it, I think the reality it is -- the company is becoming more profitable. We are very focused on profitability. We have a very good relationship with the major market participants in the option space. We touch them across a whole range of options, not just equity options because of the nature of the way those markets tend to be managed and hedged. And so we're looking at our business holistically and trying to maximize profit, improve our relationships with our customers and not destroy shareholder value. And I don't know and care where the volumes come out. And whether we're the biggest or the smallest, I want to have run a company that's the best. Scott A. Hill: But I think you've seen most of the impact of those share changes flowed through in the fourth quarter in January, and I think it's likely we stabilize. And then, you also noted the RPC was up well in January. And just to be very explicit, that loss in market share had 0 impact on our bottom line. Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And then with regards to the whole, kind of, New York Stock Exchange part of the business as it were, I mean, you're clearly still kind of quite deep in the integration, there's a lot to do this year, specifically in that part of the business. And you're also making some noises and making some suggestions with respect to market structure change. But how do you think about where this fits as part of the ICE group medium term and longer term, or maybe in what scenario would it make sense for New York Stock Exchange to be independent again? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: It's a good question. I mean, I woke up over the holidays to an article that somebody predicted that we were going to sell the business in 2015. Even though there's a lot of earnings per share growth that we are going to get out of that business over 15, '16 that we've laid out here, it's -- in that sense, it's an important part of our shareholder story. The actual trading of stocks is only 5% of our revenues. I don't know that the trading of equities is ever going to be wildly profitable for anybody. It's highly competitive, it's highly fragmented, it's highly regulated. And so -- but the ancillary parts that come out of that, which is a fabulous listings franchise and data business, are growing and doing really well. And we've been able to change the trajectory of those and change the cost structure underneath those businesses. So I don't know why we would get rid of that. It's -- I think, our shareholders want to participate in the earnings growth of that business. Now once we reach a terminal value, I guess, we, as I've mentioned before, we hold ourselves to growing earnings. If that business is a drag on us and we can't use it to grow earnings, then it's completely insignificant. And unlike a lot of people in the exchange space, you've seen us shed businesses. We don't -- we will curate where we go and modify what we do. And so it's hard to predict right now, but I can tell you, at least for the next couple of years, that, that is going to be -- that business is going to be a big contributor to our bottom line. So that's how I think about it. Operator : And the next question comes Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : First question for either Jeff or Scott. Thanks for the disclosure on the organic revenue growth, $100 million of data in listings. Maybe if you can talk a little bit also about organic growth from new contracts? Just a couple of days ago, I think you launched 63 new contracts in Europe. It's something you have a long time ago used to disclose about organic revenue growth from new contracts. Maybe just give us a sense of how you see that fitting into the organic growth picture over the next 2, 3 years. Scott A. Hill: It's a good question. You're right, it's a metric that we've talked about from time-to-time. We look back in the 2014. We were just under about $15 million of incremental revenue that we got from those new products. As we've talked about in the past, that drops straight to the bottom line. It's, give or take, a little bit $0.10 or $0.11 of earnings per share we get from the new products that we've launched over time. The other interesting statistic that I look back is if I look over the last 5 years, we've generated north of $130 million from those new products overall. So as I've said many times in the past, the next $50 million, the next $75 million, it's unlikely that any one of those is driving $100 million, but it definitely adds up. And there's very little incremental cost of launching of those new products. We launched those new products into almost certain demand because the products we launch are ones that customers tell us they need. So it was a nice little adder in 2014. I suspect that will be the case again in 2015. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : And do you think there is a lot of capacity to continue doing this on a regular basis going forward? Scott A. Hill: Yes, I think we've demonstrated, we've got to be over 1,000 new products now that we've launched since we opened up ICE Clear Europe back in 2008. And again, we're in constant dialogue with our customers about the next product they need to fill out their risk management portfolio. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: And if you think about all these new products, we've largely been in our historical commodity business. But now with the acquisition of NYSE Euronext, we have moved into the financial space through interest rates and through credits, that we started organically. So we've got a new palette to paint on there, with interesting new products. That's a lot of work going on internally here to come up with that road map. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Right, right. So your opportunity set is -- opportunity set is greatly expanded with these different businesses. Then, just a follow up on the ICE Benchmark Administration. Jeff or Scott, how do you think about that longer term? I think, Scott, I think you said in a conference at one point, you saw it may be -- potentially that could be $100 million revenue business, like the CDS business, at some point in the future. Maybe if you can give a little sort of a roadmap over the next 2, 3, 4 years, if you think that can actually happen, and what were the drivers. Scott A. Hill: Yes, I don't recall saying it was going to be $100 million business. I might have commented that it is a business that's similar to the CDS clearing business that we've created. It's really one that effectively didn't exist until we started it with LIBOR a year and change ago. I think the real value of that business, and you're already seeing it, is it started out as the LIBOR administrator. Around that, it's built a governance infrastructure, it's built a discipline around how those rates are determined, it's putting confidence around those rates. That model is replicable in multiple places. And the next step was ISDAFIX, and Jeff talked about that in his remark. The more recent steps was in gold. And so I think there are a couple of opportunities in that business. Number one, I think there's an opportunity to get the market confidence back in those benchmarks and to see growth around those benchmarks, LIBOR, ISDAFIX and gold. But I think we can leverage platform that we've built, the governance structure we've built to deploy it across multiple asset classes. I don't know what the size of that is 2 years from now, 5 years from now, but it's bigger than it is today, and I think it's going to be a meaningful contributor. Operator : Our the question comes from Neil Stratton with Citi. Neil Stratton - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Most of my questions have been asked and answered at this point. But just I wanted to ask about dark pools, there's been some -- dark pools have been increasing in the news lately, and there's a buyside consortium, which looks to be formed. I just wanted to get your thoughts on that dynamic. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: So we've been working quietly -- trying to work quietly to build consensus on what a market structure change could look like for the U.S. equities business. And from time-to-time, there've been leaks as those efforts have been going on. It's a dynamic conversation that's happening. We're talking to people all throughout the industry. We're making real progress, I think, in trying to forge consensus around what might be a better structure for everybody. And then, part of that is the ability for large institutional investors to be able to match trades and not move the market through the leakage of information. And that's a very legitimate concern on their part. It exists in every market that we serve in some form or fashion. And oftentimes, in these other markets that we serve, there are broker intermediaries or telephones involved. But given the liquid nature and high degree of standardization in equities, people want to try to do that electronically, and hence, you have the dark pool. So I think it's good that the market is trying to solve for a highly meritorious dark pool solution that gets large size done without leakage of information and without negative consequences that some of the existing dark pools have on the investors and their confidence. And so, in that sense, it would be great if I could own the entire market. We can't. We won't. We never will. And what we do try to do is come up with solutions for our customers for the parts of the market where we do things well. And in the context of meritorious dark pool trading, we think that it's very important that, that listed markets have a good quote, because the dark pool depend on a good quote. And many of the people listening on this call get mark-to-market on these good quotes. And investment decisions are made on good quotes. And companies decide go public and raise capital based on the confidence they have that their stock will be accurately dealt with and treated in the market. And so we're making, I think, real strides in shaping the conversation around how this market should evolve in the United States. Operator : And the next question comes from Rob Rutschow with CLSA. Robert Rutschow - CLSA Limited, Research Division : The first question is another one on oil. My understanding had been that the producers were a much bigger part of the market for oil than the consumers, maybe 3x or 4x figure. So, one, is that the case? And then based on your commentary, it sounded like that natural gas market is different where the consumers are maybe more of the market. So is that the case? And do those percentages move around a lot over time? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Well, let me, I may have, I misspoken. In the natural gas market, the natural producer is a natural gas company, the natural consumer is a natural gas distribution company or regulated utility. So in a sense, there are very few actual consumers in the natural gas market. These are institutional players, institutional -- commercial institutions that are hedging in either their exposure in the cost of producing wells or their exposure in delivering natural gas to customers for which there are regulators that have a voice in. That's a very different market than almost every other market we serve, where buyers and sellers are unregulated and are really hedging for totally commercial reasons, including the oil market. Scott A. Hill: Yes, I mean you can think about, I mean, airlines are massive consumers of oil. And so in terms of production and consumption, I don't see anywhere near the imbalance you suggest that exists. And in fact, many commercial organizations are consumers of oil and are hedgers in that space as well. So I don't see the balance that you suggested. Robert Rutschow - CLSA Limited, Research Division : Okay. That's very helpful. A follow up would be, it looked like you -- based on my math, you've got a pretty big pickup in your non-rate financial RPC this quarter. Just wondering if there was -- if it's a mix shift or if there were some pricing changes in FX or equity. Scott A. Hill: No, most of the rate changes that you're seeing right now are largely mix-related. Operator : And the last question comes from Kenneth Hill with Barclays. Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Research Division : I wanted to come back to some of those changes you've quietly been adjusting for the cash equities market here. I'm wondering, based on some of your discussions, if you believe it's harder to get meaningful data from pilots or limited testing in your own market? And, I guess, I ask because every time we suggest something, it's the thought that it's okay, let's pilot this with the select group of stocks in a specific market, but it would seem like something like reducing caps on access fees or implementing a trade-out rule or doing a mid-day auction would require more complete system enhancement on the market participant side to get some good data out of it. So I guess from your seat, do you think that you can actually get really good data from some of these pilots? Or is it necessary to kind of go out and build a consensus around some of these changes in advance? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: It's a very good question. First of all, I mean, interestingly, the current market structure that I've been advocating change to is technically a pilot. So that word is used pretty broadly in the regulated U.S. equity space. There's diverging views about -- in the market about what would make it better. And there's new data coming in from Canada, Australia and soon, Europe, for changes that they've been making to market structure. So as a result of that, I do think there's more of a consensus forming. But there are diverging views, and it may be that what's good for a large cap stock, very liquid large cap stock, may not be the same that's good for a small-cap stock. And so in that sense, there's conversation about whether or not one size should fit all and should we try some of these things to see whether -- maybe be one size should fit all. And so pilots give you an opportunity to do that. But bear in mind that often times, in the equity world, pilot is not a little tiny thing that's done in a laboratory. It involves everybody in the industry and can actually be quite large, as the current market structure is. Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Research Division : I appreciate the comments there. The last one for me is on CDS. You've got a great year 2014. I see growing OTC clearing is pretty high in your list of opportunities for next year. As you look forward and think about the future growth, is it predicated on more launching new products and bringing in new clearing customers? Or is it through more holistic measures like the swap futures partnerships you announced with Eris and leveraging some open interest you have and something like the Eris, do you expect that to be more of a complimentary product to your traditional CDS? Or is it more of a substitution thing? Just wondering how to think about that when that launches here soon. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: That's a really good question. I think the opportunity -- there are a number of opportunities that will allow us to continue to grow our CDS business. Clearly, continuing to launch new products is a big part of it, big part of the growth that we saw last year was us continuing to introduce sovereign CDS instruments as an example. And we're in constant dialogue with the industry regarding where their CDS risks are in products we don't clear, and that's a clear focus for us. I think continuing to expand the customer base, that clearing CDS is another growth driver, we still don't have a mandate in Europe. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are seeing a lot of the European clients doing clearing for CDS in our U.S. clearinghouse to get rid -- to get away from the uncertainty that exists in Europe. So I think that will continue to expand. Clearly, a mandate would accelerate that, but I think the market itself without a mandate has started to see the value and realize the value of clearing and the risk mitigation in the CDS space that it brings. And then clearly, I think the Eris product and moving to an alternative product will be incremental. I do think there's likely to be some replacement aspect with regard to CDS index. But with regards to single names, with regards to sovereigns, with regards to a number of other products, I really think effectively, it will be incremental. Operator : And as we have no more questions, I would like to turn the call back over to management for any closing comments. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Thank you, Keith, and thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you throughout the quarter. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kelly Loeffler. Please go ahead. Kelly L. Loeffler: [indiscernible] first quarter 2015 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of theice.com. These items will be archived, and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our Form 10-K. In addition to GAAP results, we also refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including adjusted net income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted expenses, adjusted EPS and adjusted tax rate. We believe these non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP term in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful as well as how management uses these measures. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction based expenses, adjusted net income refers to adjusted net income from continuing operations, and adjusted earnings refer to adjusted diluted continuing operations earnings per share. With us on the call are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Chuck Vice, President and Chief Operating Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Scott. Scott A. Hill: Thank you, Kelly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. I'll begin on Slide 4, which highlights our first quarter performance, the best quarter in our company's history. We grew adjusted earnings 26% year-to-year by growing revenues 7% and expanding adjusted operating margins to 60%. Our commodities, data services and listings offerings all contributed to solid top line growth. We extended NYSE's leadership in capital raising and increased share in revenue capture and cash equity. We demonstrated continued expense discipline as the benefits of our rapid integration of Liffe and the New York Stock Exchange flowed through to the bottom line. And importantly, even as we invested in future growth, we also returned $269 million of capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. Moving to Slide 5. I'll detail our first quarter financial results. Adjusted earnings rose 26% from the prior first quarter to a record $3.06. Net revenues grew 7% year-over-year to $850 million, including record revenues for data services and for NYSE listing. Adjusted operating expenses declined 4% year-over-year to $336 million, and adjusted operating margin reached 60%. And we've generated operating cash flow of $465 million. Now let's turn to Slide 6, where I'll provide more detail on our revenues and expenses. On the left side of the slide, you can see that net transaction and clearing revenues grew 2% year-to-year to $506 million. This was enabled by an 11% increase in commodity revenues on the strength of our global oil markets. Our non-transaction revenues, which comprise 40% of net revenues, grew 15%. Within non-transaction revenues, our data services revenues grew 19% to a record $187 million. This was driven by the addition of hundreds of new users of ICE's real-time market data as well as the addition of SuperDerivatives and ICE Benchmark Administration. NYSE listings revenues grew 12% year-to-year to a record $101 million, reflecting the NYSE's global leadership in IPOs over the past 4 years. Finally, U.S. cash and equities options revenues declined 1% year-over-year to $82 million. Cash equities market share, revenue capture and revenues increased, but this strong performance was offset by an increasingly competitive equity options market and structural changes we are making. Importantly, despite the lower options revenues, the profit contribution from the options business was not impacted. On the right side of Slide 6, I'll detail our expenses. First quarter adjusted expenses declined 4% to $336 million as we continue to generate synergies. Technology and D&A expense increased slightly from the prior first quarter due to investments to further integrate our acquisitions and to consolidate our real estate footprint in our major locations. This was more than offset by a 40% reduction in professional services as we continue to reduce the significant reliance on consultants and contractors at NYSE. While some contractors were converted to full-time employees, comp and benefit expense still decreased by 2%. The combination of solid revenue growth and continued expense disciplines produced an adjusted operating margin of 60%. Next, on Slide 7, I'll detail the performance across our futures exchanges for the first quarter. Despite low volatility in volumes, which decreased 7%, open interest rose 4% from the start of the year. Total futures and options revenues grew 3% from the prior first quarter to $369 million, driven by record volume in our Brent and other oil products. Brent revenues grew 51% year-to-year to a record $74 million. Brent continues to expand its lead as the global benchmark for pricing crude and refined oil products, with open interest up 15% from year-end to a record 4.4 million contracts. Notably, Brent open interest is up 49% from last March, with strong growth due to the ongoing shift of Brent in commodity indexes and longer-term secular trends. This growth continued in April, with daily volume in our global oil markets up 21% over last April and Brent open interest again reaching a new record. Natural gas revenue increased 4% over last year's first quarter to $58 million, driven by strong growth in our European gas market, which offset muted North American natural gas volatility. Interest rate revenues were $56 million, down 30% over the prior first quarter due to continued low interest rate policies in Europe. However, our revenue capture across all of our categories, energy, ag and financials, improved year-to-year and provided a solid foundation for revenue growth across our diverse set of product offerings. Finally, despite overall volume declines in April, strong commodities volumes, combined with continued strength in data and listings, enabled solid revenue growth again in April. Moving to Slide 8, I'll provide an update on our swaps markets and clearing. Total credit derivatives revenues for the quarter were $43 million, flat compared to last year's first quarter. CDS clearing revenues were $29 million, including an additional $3 million accrual related to a change in our deferred revenue calculation. Growth in buyside participation continued, which accounted for 37% of the gross notional cleared in the quarter in our U.S. CDS clearinghouse, ICE Clear Credit. We also continue to see strong European buyside activity in our U.S. clearinghouse, with European activity accounting for roughly 40% of total buyside gross notional cleared. Buyside participation in our U.S. CDS clearinghouse has grown rapidly over the past 2 years. This is due, in part, to our comprehensive product offering and portfolio margining as well as the relative regulatory certainty in the U.S. We are continuing to expand our cleared instruments to serve our customers as they adapt to regulatory change. I'll wrap up my remarks on Slide 9 with an update of our cash flows, capital structure and capital return. Operating cash flows were $465 million in the first quarter. This included $272 million collected related to annual listing fee payment and the payment of $104 million for the cash portion of our 2014 performance bonus. At March 31, we had $776 million in net unrestricted cash and short-term investments. Included in that cash balance is $187 million of additional regulatory capital that will be required when ICE Clear Europe becomes EMIR-authorized. Net debt was $3.2 billion, and our adjusted debt to EBITDA was 1.6x. In addition to reducing our leverage, we used our strong cash generation during the quarter to return $269 million to shareholders, comprised of $73 million in dividend and $196 million in share repurchases. Importantly, our Board of Directors approved a 15% increase in our cash dividend to $0.75 per share, which will be effective with the second quarter dividend payment in June. Our board also approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization in April, and we have over $500 million remaining on that authorization. Going forward, we expect to maintain approximately $500 million in operational cash and a leverage ratio of around 1.5x. We otherwise intend to use 100% of our future cash flows to invest in our business and return capital to shareholders. Starting in 2016, we anticipate a more normalized level of capital expenditures between $150 million and $200 million. In addition, we will continue to execute strategic M&A that generates above -- returns above our cost to capital. Importantly, we expect to continue to return a meaningful level of capital to shareholders through our ongoing and disciplined share repurchases and the dividend that grows when we do. We are off to a solid start in 2015 and are continuing to execute on our financial and strategic objectives. We grew revenue 7% and adjusted earnings 26% and returned $269 million in capital to shareholders even as we continue to integrate multiple acquisitions and invest in future growth. The purposeful diversification of our revenue streams and access to secular growth trends position us to again generate double-digit earnings growth and strong returns for our shareholders in 2015. I'll be happy to answer any questions during Q&A, and I'll now hand the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Thank you, Scott, and good morning to everyone on the call. Our record revenue and earnings were the result of revenue growth across the board, expense discipline and rising operating margins. Each of our major product lines, execution in clearing, data and listings, whether transaction or recurring revenue, made a contribution to our 26% adjusted earnings growth during the quarter. To continue to grow and innovate, we have a number of long-term strategic initiatives and near-term profit drivers, several of which are listed on Slide 10. These are designed to foster ongoing revenue growth, operational enhancements, margin expansion and effective capital deployment. We started with just one asset class, energy, and then strategically diversified into 9 asset classes. As a result, we have additional opportunities to grow and to innovate in related areas like new products, clearing, data and listings. This includes our cash equities markets, where we have solidly increased results from both a market share and revenue capture perspective while enhancing our operations and our technology. We're developing our new trading platform known as Pillar for the New York Stock Exchange to consolidate 5 platforms into 1 state-of-the-art platform. This will support a streamlined market model, which will reduce complexity for our customers while also reducing our operating costs. You could see that we're investing in our listings business and our cash equities markets, both of which have grown revenues double digits in the last 2 quarters and are generating very solid returns. Our reach across the global financial and commodities markets has also created opportunities to innovate and expand our data services. We've established a growing benchmark administration group to answer the call for regulated, transparent benchmarks, building on the LIBOR and ISDAFIX mandates that we began last year. Our acquisition of SuperDerivatives added to our expertise in complex derivatives valuation and supports our expansion of clearing services with proprietary data as Europe's clearing requirements come into effect in the coming year. In the meantime, we're developing more product choices, such as our Eris futures contract for CDS and European interest rates. Similarly, the regulatory environment continues to drive both challenges and opportunities. In Europe, ongoing financial reform is creating uncertainty for our customers, from end users to financial institutions. We and other market operators have seen shifts in our customers' preference on where they choose to manage risk in the swaps and futures markets away from Europe and toward the U.S., validating our investment decision to operate multiple regional venues on common technology. And while regulation is creating uncertainty, complexity and potentially, market fragmentation, it also presents an opportunity to help our customers efficiently adapt to this change. Similarly, Asia's markets are expanding due to greater demand for the type of products we currently offer through our Western exchanges and clearinghouses. Our work there is foundational, and we will launch ICE Futures Singapore and ICE Clear Singapore this year. We're seeing a good deal of interest in our newly announced Asian market products and for the increased access to central clearing. We had a presence in Singapore for many years, and we're continuing to work closely with our customers there. So as you can see, we have many long-term opportunities before us. And here, we've also noted several of our near-term earning drivers. We remain levered to strong secular trends, ranging from global energy market hedging to the demand for clearing and data services, which continue to drive growth across our customer base. As a part of our ongoing integration work, we're making great progress on our expense synergy objectives. And we're continuing to look across the company to ensure that we are operating efficiently. This is something we do well, continuously looking at the best use of our resources and creating cost efficiencies even as we grow. These are all key elements of our strategic plan to ensure that we remain a growth company. I'll provide more detail on a few of ICE's markets now beginning on Slide 11. First, our leading global energy markets. The ICE Brent contract continues to advance as the global oil benchmark and set volume and open interest records. Brent is benefiting from long-term secular trends that has driven consistent open interest records and is betting from near-term trends the ongoing price volatility, which has resulted in record volume. ICE Brent, together with the introduction of over 400 related oil products, has enabled us to continue to grow our broad complex of oil products through economic cycles. This includes ICE's WTI contract, where daily volume grew 57% year-to-year in the quarter. And in January, we completed the transition of our distillate market to our new gas oil futures contract specification, providing a greater range of hedging opportunities in the global diesel markets. As a result, the ICE gas oil daily volume increased 17% year-to-year in the first quarter. Also, on the slide, you can see our U.S. natural gas market strengthen relative to the prior 3 quarters. During the first quarter of last year, the U.S. was feeling the effects of the polar vortex, and the volatility of natural gas prices was very strong. As a result, our first quarter 2015 natural gas volumes declined 10% versus the tough comparisons of last year. However, this trading volume doesn't tell our revenue story. Due to an increasingly favorable product mix, ICE's global natural gas revenues actually increased 4%, driven by strong growth in our non-U.S. natural gas markets. Now moving on to Slide 12, I'll update you on our European interest rates complex. Ongoing near 0 interest rate levels in the eurozone impacted volatility and, therefore, impacted the trading volume across our interest rate complex. However, we've seen a healthy increase in open interest, which is generally a good indicator of future trading volumes. Total open interest in interest rates increased 11% in the first quarter, with Euribor up 17% and Sterling and Gilt both up 7%. We expect to introduce ERIS-style futures for European interest rates in June as a solution to offer capital efficiencies amid the implementation of bank capital rules and other market reforms. So you can see that we are building out our interest rate portfolio to provide all of the necessary tools to mitigate risk and maximize capital efficiencies as we prepare for European interest rate volatility. Turning to Slide 13, I'll note the solid growth trend in our data services businesses. By combining ICE's historical data with the data that we acquired and reorganized from the New York Stock Exchange, Liffe and SuperDerivatives, we've expanded the markets that we cover. Together with our newly formed benchmark administration company, this has allowed us to develop a broader portfolio of information services for our global customer base. In the first quarter, we earned record data revenues. And over the course of the last 2 years, we have quadrupled our data services revenues. This is a result of providing an expanding range of data to a growing range of customers across all geographies and asset classes. At ICE Benchmark Administration, in March, the ICE Swap Rate replaced the ISDAFIX, and we successfully launched the gold price with record-level participation. We've also undertaken market consultations for both LIBOR and the LBMA Gold Prices to evolve the best practices for determining these prices. Now on Slide 14, I'll highlight the solid momentum that we are driving in the New York Stock Exchange listings and our improving cash equity markets. The New York Stock Exchange continued to lead in global capital raising, with $50 billion in total proceeds raised in the first quarter. This is more than the next 2 largest exchanges combined. And we continue to attract companies of all sectors and market capitalizations because of our unique market model, combined with our unparalleled visibility and service. All of this drove record listings revenues surpassing $100 million, up 12% over last year's first quarter. We're excited about the strong pipeline of transactions that we see for 2015. And we continue to raise the bar as the global listings venue across technology markets and other growth sectors. I'll conclude my remarks on Slide 15 with a recap of the absolute best quarter in our company's history. We delivered record revenues, record operating income and record earnings. We expanded adjusted operating margins to 60%, delivered on our expense synergy forecast and made disciplined investments, all of which drove our adjusted earnings per share growth an impressive 26% over last year's first quarter. We've returned nearly $1.3 billion to shareholders since we began our first dividend payment just 16 months ago. And today, we also announced a 15% increase to our quarterly dividend. I'm pleased to conclude my prepared comments on this Slide 15, where we continued to demonstrate that ICE is a growth company, delivering earnings per share growth in every full year since we became a public company across a wide range of market and regulatory challenges that our customers have faced over the last decade. Our company remains focused on innovating to solve the challenges that are faced by our customers, whether hedging, raising capital or complying with regulatory reform. On behalf of everyone at ICE, I want to thank our customers for trusting us with their business and for collaborating on their evolving requirements during this very dynamic time. I'll now ask our operator, Andrew, to conduct the question-and-answer session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : First, on the competitive landscape, ICE built a business by challenging the establishment. And I guess with New York Stock Exchange, you are, in part, part of the establishment. So as I think about New York Stock Exchange, how do you -- what is the -- how are you defending against encroachment by new entrants? And can you defend your strategy to defend the business? So in particular, I'm looking at 2 things. One is the options business, which you mentioned in the prepared remarks, but Miami and BATS are taking share and seem to be leveraging the changes that have been made at Amex. And then on the ETF business, BATS is making a big push, has hired away some NYSE alums to grow that business. So the question again, how are you defending your position as the incumbent? And why is that the right approach? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Very good question. So let me start maybe with the options business first. We have, in a very disciplined way, decided to not participate in options volume that does not earn a return for the company. And so people love to talk about market share, but I ended on Slide 15 where we talk about earnings per share growth for our shareholders. And so we are very -- in a very calculated manner, trying to raise the operational performance of the NYSE and its related businesses by curating what we do there. So the fact that we send uncompetitive business to our competitors is to not concern our shareholders, they should be happy. And let's let those competitors have the bragging rights if they have a lot of market share, but there isn't a lot of income to go along with some of that business. With respect to ETFs and the trading of stocks, we're investing heavily in the New York Stock Exchange. We think that there's an incredible opportunity for return on invested capital above our costs by putting money in there. We have actually opened a new trading floor on the New York Stock Exchange, which I don't think people are aware of. People like to talk about us selling the business or closing the floor. We've actually put more money down there. We've invested in the infrastructure of our building. We're investing in advocacy for -- on behalf of listed companies, organized events for listed companies, marketing for us and listed companies. And what you've seen is, as a result of that, we've really been able to grow our listings business, both in companies going public and ETFs. We find that there are -- that companies want to affiliate with us. They want to be part of that organization. They want to identify with our brand. They want to take that globally. And so I just continue to see opportunities to invest. We are the premium brand around the world for capital raising, and we prove it quarter-after-quarter since we've owned this company. The fact that somebody wants to go start a discount franchise and what I view as tarnish brands and not earn income for their shareholders the way we want to do above our cost of capital, it's fine, and it's business. But that -- we're happy to have that kind of competition. I don't fear it. I welcome it. And by the way, Ken, I rarely welcome any kind of competition. And so I truly mean that. Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Great. And then secondly, on the regulatory landscape, what is most top-of-mind for ICE today? And where does ICE need to either invest the most time or what is most important in terms of rules and regions to make sure the ICE point of view is expressed to regulators to get the right result for the market? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Well, I think we're simultaneously spending a fair amount of time both in Europe and the U.S. The EMIR and MIFID laws have been passed, but the details have not been promulgated. And in the U.S., Dodd-Frank has been passed, but all the details have not been promulgated. And the biggest issue for us is making sure that the Western regulators move somewhat in concert with each other and not create regulatory arbitrage or barriers to business. Now as you know, we've invested regionally in order to have infrastructure in case that were to happen. And we think that was a prudent way to place the company so that we can grow regardless. But that being said, it's really, really important to us that we see regulation move together. So we moved back and forth between the 2 continents, providing data and details that we hope regulators will take under their wing. I will tell you that we see tremendous dialogue and conversation at the top levels of government in the U.K., Continental Europe and the U.S. to try to move together. So this is something that is top-of-mind for senior people in government. And we're trying to create a supportive role to point out various details with the policies that they're thinking about. I think we've been very successful. There are others doing this. There's -- it's kind of an industry collaboration in many regards. But I would tell you that we feel much better about the state of play on this earnings call than we felt on past earnings calls because we really see attempts by regulators to make this happen in a cohesive and organized manner. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Carrier from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sameer Murukutla - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : This is Sameer Murukutla for Mike Carrier. Just on the regulatory topic, can you provide an update on the disagreements between the U.S. and Europe still? And as a follow-up, can you speak about the Basel rules and the pressures that the current set of rules create on FDMs and the Basel impact this might have on your business and maybe any resolution that you see in the works? Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Sure. Look, I'll take the first half of that question. Actually, we really do see a lot of meetings going on, and we've been providing a lot of collateral material, background information, hard data to the U.S. and European regulators and politicians. And it does feel like -- and you've probably seen press reports if you follow this area that suggest that these guys are very close to trying to find a way to harmonize and, in fact, do it in a way that is relatively similar, not just somewhat equivalent but really trying to get rid of loopholes so that the Western countries can set an example for the rest of the world on how to bring regulation together. So we are cautiously optimistic that the landscape is unfolding in a way that is beneficial to our customers and their ability to do business around the world. Let me ask Scott, who oversees our clearing operations, to take the second half of that. Scott A. Hill: Yes. With regards to Basel and the capital rules more generally, there's no question that the financial institutions, the clearing members that are part of our clearinghouses are under an immense amount of pressure from all of the various capital rules. And that's one of the reasons why you see us continuing to work on things like portfolio margining at our CDS clearinghouse, offering new products at all of our clearinghouses, whether it's interest rates or energy, trying to generate capital efficiencies. It's one of the reasons why we've been out publicly, saying that we would contemplate adding more skin in the game because that is a way of reducing some of the capital pressures on the banks. Historically, one of the reasons why ICE has been successful is we worked with our customers to understand their pain points and to try and come up with solutions to alleviate that pain. And the capital restrictions are one of them. You mentioned Basel specifically. It's somewhat counterintuitively, the Basel rule around capital in Europe is interpreted that the margin that the clearing members collect from their end customers is not risk-reducing. And in fact, in the U.S., that rule has been interpreted that it's actually risk-increasing and ignores the fact that those margins are passed straight through to the clearinghouse, and the banks really can't leverage them in any way. So we're participating, along with the clearing members, in the dialogue with the regulators, as Jeff said earlier, to make sure that we do get to a more rational place in terms of the rules. We all understand that the capital requirements are going up, not just for the financial institutions but for our clearinghouses as well. We now have around $600 million of regulatory capital and skin in the game, largely associated with the clearinghouses. But capital constraints are definitely an issue with the clearing members, and we're spending a lot of time with them and regulators, trying to get that to a better place. Operator : The next question comes from Kenneth Hill from Barclays. Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Research Division : So I wanted to start with the 15% increase to the dividend. I'm wondering if you could walk through some of the thought process there and maybe any conversations with investors that led to the increase because it seems like it kind of puts you at a place where you're not quite screening as a strong dividend company. So I'm wondering where that could probably go over time and maybe how you compare that versus repurchases longer term. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: It's a good question. So I think Scott mentioned in his prepared remarks that our view is that as we grow the earnings of the company, we should be growing the dividend. And if we're doing a good job as managers, we will constantly be growing earnings, and we will constantly be growing the dividend. And we've just sort of gotten started, if you will, as being a dividend-paying company. And we're proud of the fact that we've pretty quickly now started to increase the dividend. In terms of how we allocate capital, which is really at the root of your question, we think our buying back our stock right now is the best opportunity for growth for our shareholders. I mean, if you look at ICE this quarter, we did $850 million in revenues. Our nearest competitor did $843 million. So we virtually sat on top of each other. Our competitor in earnings did something like $330 million, but there was $10 million of FX in there. So for talking purposes, let me call it $320 million. And we did $315 million, virtually sitting right on top of each other. Our nearest competitor grew 15%. We grew 26%. And we see a pathway for continued growth that is much easier for us than for our competitor. Yet our stock trades at a P/E or PEG ratio discount to the -- to our competitors. So it looks to us like our stock is a very good buy. That's what our internal analysis shows. We have other competitors that are actually x growth that have a higher P/E. We have people that are in our space that operate businesses that are simply execution platforms with complete -- fungible clearing that trade at a higher P/E. And yet we are -- you can look at Slide 15 and see we are a growth company, and we don't think that our stock is priced accordingly, and so we're buying it back. And I think long term, we'll be proven to be right on that. And so it's made the decision that you've asked about inside the boardroom relatively easy on how we bias our capital spending right now. Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. Next one, the follow-up here is on kind of the relaunch of the credit futures contract. Just wondering how you're seeing customers approach the product versus maybe your more traditional CDS clearing business and what's causing a customer to choose maybe one or the other, whether it's the cost or the index followed or the way that cash flows are replicated, just wondering if you could help us think through how the swap futures growth and maybe with the launch of the new futures product, how we can think about that. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Sure. Really, the backdrop is going back to the earlier question that Scott fielded. The capital rules on banks and clearers are -- and now increasingly on our customers through the margins that are being charged -- are pretty significant. And by regulation in U.S. and in Europe and Asia, illiquid swaps contracts have to have a clearinghouse assume a 5-day liquidation period. So there's a 5-day -- the mathematical models have a 5-day holding period. Liquid futures contracts are 1-day gross or 2-day net, something in that range. And so to the extent that we can take the liquid part of what exists in the swaps market and make it trade as liquid futures, it will be much cheaper, much less capital tied up in the industry. And that's why people are looking at this and thinking about it. We're very, very early days right now. We have a lot of work to do with the industry to get that futures contract distributed through the desktops and the back-office systems that swap traders historically use. And there's a big industry push and conversation going on about getting this particular contract listed. This one has much more interest in it than when we tried it 2 years ago. And I think the environment has moved forward, these capital pressures have moved forward, and the design of the contract is one that people understand better than what we tried before. So we're cautiously optimistic. It's early days, but the underlying business case for the standardization of the liquid part of the swaps curve is there. Operator : The next question comes from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill. Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : I guess the first question is on the non-transaction revenue, on the data service fees as well as the listing fees. So Scott, you -- the 10% up year-over-year guidance, it looked we're already at that run rate. So I guess the question is, where do you see these lines trending? And that's even with the SuperDerivatives in it. Where do you see the lines trending? Is that guidance pretty conservative right now? And any breakouts you can give in regards to benchmark administration, contribution, et cetera, I think, would be helpful. Scott A. Hill: Yes. I'm not going to break down the bits and pieces too much, Rich. But I'll help a little bit on the trend. We had guided at the end of last year that data revenues and listings revenues were going to be strong. We expected to come out of the gate strong as we did in the first quarter. And frankly, as I look to the rest of the year, I think the second, third, fourth quarter are going to look a lot like the first quarter. And if you look on a year-over-year basis, that's going to mean solid year-over-year growth in listings and data every single quarter the rest of the year. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Yes, Rich. We -- Scott mentioned in his prepared remarks, hopefully, it didn't go unnoticed, that we are amazed that we've had hundreds of new users come to our dataset. This is a real growth story for us, and it's happened quite quickly. Our team has done a really good job out in the field, bringing our data to new customers. And the pipeline for listings looks really strong for the next -- the visibility we have into the rest of the year. So we feel pretty good about true growth coming from new users. Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : I guess we're going to see whether Scott's 10% up is conservative or not then. I guess my follow-up would be -- and you didn't -- the same -- what you said, Jeff, in your prepared remarks is consistent with what we are hearing from the FCMs that there's a shift away from the U.K. banks, and there's more business moving to the U.S., I guess, U.S. banks. And then so I guess the question is, we now look at the equivalence issue as the -- probably the near-term biggest regulatory issue. But let's assume that gets compromised, have you -- as you've sort of referred to or hinted at. But this movement of customers, I -- is this, do you think, just temporary, and once the regulations get in place -- or is the regulatory framework over there just going to be different where some of these changes might be permanent? And I guess I'm asking this because of the open access issue over there, a shift to the U.S. would, I think, be in your benefit, if I'm correct. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Well, it's a good question. First of all, I'm not sure that a shift to the U.S. is in our benefit. We are very, very well positioned in Europe and are making real investments there to take advantage of changes that are going on. So there may be slightly different models in different regions, but we want to maximize our profitability in each of those regions. The other interesting thing that really, it's a follow-on to what you mentioned that you've been seeing is there's also a lot of capital moving towards Asia. I mean, you see it in the demand right now for the linkage between the Hong Kong Exchange and the Shanghai Stock Exchange in equities. But there is capital flowing towards Asia for commodities, derivatives and other things. So it's very, very hard for us to predict where the markets will go. Right after Dodd-Frank passed, if you were to listen to the conversation, you would have thought people were going to leave the U.S. because they didn't like Dodd-Frank. Now we see this opposite impact where people are moving business to the U.S. and seem to be more comfortable with Dodd-Frank. There are still parts of regulations like -- that affect our customers like position limits and additional capital rules and other things that are yet to be promulgated. So this may be temporary. We don't know. That's why we basically wanted to be pretty diverse, and that's why I feel very good that we've got the right tools to continue our -- on our earnings growth trajectory because we're very well positioned in each of these venues. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Allen of Evercore. Christopher J. Allen - Evercore ISI, Research Division : Just want to follow up real quickly on Rich's question. You mentioned that 2Q versus 4 -- through 4Q would look a lot like 1Q for the market data and listings. Were you referring to growth or the actual revenue numbers? Because the growth... Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Actual revenue numbers. Christopher J. Allen - Evercore ISI, Research Division : Actual revenue numbers, okay. Just wanted to clarify that. And then, Jeff, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned natural gas. You're seeing a big pickup or a big growth in non-U.S. Is that just concentrated in Europe or you're seeing it more broadly than Europe right now? I'm just kind of looking for more color there. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Yes. It's mostly Europe although the interest level of -- as capital is deployed looking for natural gas around the world, it seems to be moving away from the U.S. towards other areas. And the big global companies that we're very close to are looking all around the world. So at this point, it tends to be parts of Europe, but I -- we're really setting the company up to be a global gas franchise. Operator : The next question comes from Alex Kramm of UBS. Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Sorry to come back to this one more time. But I would love for you to flush out this non-transaction, I guess, call it guidance a little bit more because on the one hand, you're saying you're adding users, and you're very excited. On the one hand, you say revenue is flattish for the rest of the year. And maybe a couple of items there to point to. In particular, on the benchmark side, it seems like LIBOR, you just really got started. There was a lot of industry pushback. So maybe just flush out where you are in terms of what inning, in terms of actually charging everyone and then making sure everybody's paying. And then maybe on the other side of the coin, like, how much of that line item is actually driven by things like market data, fee pool, the NYSE, things that maybe are not driving as much as they should be, and maybe that's where that flattish is coming from. Scott A. Hill: Yes. So I'll take exception to the flattish. So what I'm suggesting is that hundreds of new users, ICE Benchmark, SuperDerivatives, all of those things contributed to a really strong first quarter and will continue to contribute as we move through the year. So if you look at each of the quarters, even at current first quarter levels through the rest of the year, that's very solid year-over-year revenue growth, right in line with the guidance that we gave on our last earnings call. Clearly, ICE Benchmark Administration is in early days. And so we would fully expect that business to contribute more as we move through the year. The user growth that we've seen, that's in the first quarter numbers and reflected and will continue to flow through as revenue as we move through the year. SuperDerivatives, again, fully embedded, full quarter in the first quarter, will continue to flow through during the year. So what I'm suggesting is a constant trend through the year with significant year-over-year increases. Again, just do the math based on what we had for data last year and listings last year, relative to what we had in terms of absolute revenues in the first quarter. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: And Alex, maybe to get at the root of your question a little more, we saw hundreds of new users in the -- just in the commodity space. We have a much better offering now where we can go to commodity traders and offer a wider suite of data that takes in data that we've got through SuperDerivatives and through NYSE and Liffe but targeted towards commodity traders. And so there is real growth. And the idea that we have, which is we could become a better data company, have been playing out in the usage. Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay, fair enough. And then secondly, maybe just coming back to the NYSE integration, which we haven't really touched upon so far today, so I think some people were probably cautiously optimistic that you, like, give a little bit more color on how synergies are progressing and maybe see some upside. So just wondering how you feel about integration, if there are any big projects you're making any good headway on and maybe get excited about seeing more things than you originally anticipate or just -- how you feel about the integration overall. Scott A. Hill: I feel really good about the integration. I mean, look at the first quarter. Expenses are down 4%, and that's despite the fact that we added 300 employees through the acquisition of SuperDerivatives and Holland Clearing House and the other businesses we acquired. Compensation despite that was down 2% year-over-year. Professional services, down 40% year-over-year. Margins at 60%, which I'll grant you is on a very strong revenue quarter, that notwithstanding revenues grow 7%, expenses come down 4%. All of that's enabled because of the tremendous progress that we've made in our overall integration efforts. It -- I think what gets taken for granted a little bit is that the fourth quarter was well under where we had guided because we had accelerated those synergies in. And we saw continued reduction if you look 4Q to 1Q in terms of the expense performance. So I think the margin expansion that you're seeing, I think the expense trends that you're seeing, all of those are reflective of the strong integration that's occurred thus far, and there'll be more to come as we move through the year. I mean, expenses will be relatively consistent as you move to 2Q and 3Q. But then as you move into 4Q, some of the initiatives we've got going around real estate and some additional corporate function integration that we're working our way through, you'll start see the expenses come down a little bit again as we get towards the end of the year and as we move through into next year. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: And Alex, the -- we have really become known for delivering good technology. Chuck Vice, our President, and his team are driving a lot of change inside the NYSE. I mentioned in my remarks that we're moving from 5 trading platforms to 1, our new Pillar system. That will be cost savings. We are building new state-of-the-art compliance and oversight systems using our heavy technology investment in bringing then FINRA-type services in-house where I think we're going to provide much higher-quality, more real-time services at lower cost. And I think you'll see us continue and we are continuing to invest in the technology around our listings systems and the way we talk to our listed companies. So all of that technology spend will ultimately simplify that business and allow us to deliver higher-quality services at lower costs. So really good return on invested capital there that you'll see as we go through '16, I believe. Operator : The next question comes from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : A couple of questions on capital. Scott, I think you mentioned $500 million of operational cash. Curious if that's a change or just similar to what it's been. And then it's clear, your comments around the buybacks and kind of how you view your stock currently. But also, I would just like to get an update on the M&A environment and kind of how you're thinking about that and the opportunities there or how much time you're spending on that today. Scott A. Hill: Yes. No, good -- yes. So the $500 million, Dan, what we've historically said is we'd be somewhere in the $500 million to $600 million range. I think as our capital structure continues to improve, as our access to debt markets continues to improve, that we've come to the determination that the lower end of that range is where we can comfortably manage from a cash balance. So in the range but on the lower end. In terms of the overall M&A environment and how we think about it, it's not too different. Jeff, in his prepared remarks and in an earlier Q&A, really hit on the key for us, which is we continue to focus on opportunities for growth. M&A enables that, but we only are willing to look at deals where we can generate returns on invested capital that are above our cost of capital. Just to give you a sense, if you -- our projection of where we will be by the time we get to the end of this year is we'll have our returns on invested capital back above our cost of capital, and that's going to be within 2 years of closing the NYSE deal. When you consider the size of that acquisition, that's a pretty quick turnaround. You look at other competitors in the space that have spent a similar amount on acquisitions that have the return above -- invested capital above their cost of capital ever, and we're going to be back there by the end of this year. So that's how we think about M&A. Do the deals generate growth? But more importantly, do they generate, to Jeff's last chart, growth in earnings? And to the extent they do, do they generate returns on invested capital above cost of capital? That's the objective. In terms of the environment and how much time we spend, it's pretty consistent. Again, we constantly look at new opportunities for growth, whether it's a small deal like YellowJacket years ago to get into options technology, a transformative deal like the New York Stock Exchange to move into the interest rate business. We look at a range of deals all the time and go through it in a very disciplined manner to make sure it's a strategic fit, and it's a financial -- it's attractive financially. Operator : The next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : A question for you guys on the operating leverage. I think maybe a year ago or so ago, Scott, you outlined kind of the longer-term margin goals for the business or kind of just saying, look, steady state, even if revenues don't grow, given everything we're doing, margins could be well into the 60% zone. Clearly, you guys had a little bit of reporting change, but also the business is growing quite nicely. And you guys have, I think, taken out more expenses than, I think, some of us thought. So I was just wondering, steady state today, where could that margin go, again, kind of flattish revenue growth, which, of course, may not be the case, but just kind of given the growth opportunities on the -- and the trajectory of expenses, hoping to get an update on net margin. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Yes. Look, it's difficult to project margin because implicit in that is a projection on revenues. But I think if you look back at what we told you, and again, I appreciate that there's been the reporting change. But add 3 points to that chart in each period, and you're right around where that trend would be. If you look at where we are in the first quarter, again, on strong revenues, we're ahead of that trend. If you look over the course of the year, I think we're tracking right where we thought we would in terms of margin expansion. We do believe that the business can continue to track ahead as we take costs out, as we grow the top line. So again, I'm not going to predict margins 1 quarter out, 3 quarters, 2 years out. But we're on the right trend. We're seeing the expansion we expected. And I absolutely think there's an expectation that margins will continue to expand, and no reason to think we can't get back to levels similar to what we had before the NYSE deal. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Yes, makes sense. And just a quick follow-up on capital management. Can you talk a little bit, I guess, about your appetite to use some of the -- either your credit facility or revolver to accelerate some of the buybacks, just taking into account Jeff's comments and obviously your points around how strong the capital position is of the company today. You're around that 1.5, 1.6x debt to EBITDA, and EBITDA is going to grow, which is by the virtue of expenses going lower. So can you kind of walk us through that rationale? Scott A. Hill: Yes. Look, right now, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're -- we feel very good about where we've gotten in a very short amount of time. We've got a very strong cash balance. Our leverage at 1.6x is effectively where we expect it to be. We have the flexibility now with our access to debt markets that we don't need to build up cash in order to do a deal or to pay a dividend. And so again, I think as is typically the case, what you should expect of us going forward is what you've seen from us historically. We're going to allocate capital as we said. We've grown our dividend now. We will continue to grow it. When we grow, we have continued to buy back shares. If you look historically, we've bought back pretty opportunistically. Here, you'll note that it's been a pretty consistent amount because as Jeff said, the share price, where it is right now makes a lot of sense to us as a high return on investment. And so I don't think you're going to see us lever up to go and accelerate anything. I think again, what you ought to expect from us is consistency in terms of what you've seen in the recent quarters and in terms of our forward guidance on the dividend and the increase of 15% there. Operator : And the last question due to time constraints would be Chris Harris from Wells Fargo. Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : A quick follow-up on M&A. Do MiFID and EMIR change the way you guys are approaching potential M&A opportunities in Europe? Or is it just way too early to make that call? Scott A. Hill: Yes. I think it's way too early to make that call. I think at the end of the day, as Jeff alluded to, one of the things that we've really focused on historically as a business is building a geographically diverse business. And so we are investing in Europe. We bought the Holland Clearing House on the continent. We're investing in Singapore where we'll be launching an exchange and clearinghouse later this year. And so I think ultimately, we've done well by being geographically diverse. We've done well by understanding where regulations are going and listening to our customers in terms of where their preferences are. And so we continue to look globally at M&A. And I don't think there's any single piece of legislation or rule or regulation that, at least as we look at the landscape, would suggest to us that there's any geography that wouldn't be a prudent opportunity for investment, particularly in Europe. And again, I point to the Holland Clearing House that we just recently did. Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay, understood. And a quick follow-up here. Just on your RPCs, you guys have had great year-on-year growth there. You highlighted it. I know there's a lot of moving parts that go into that, mix certainly playing a role. Are there any other fees that are in your RPCs today that maybe weren't in there a year ago that's helping to drive the increase? Or is it all just mix and customers? Scott A. Hill: No. It is largely mix and customers. And again, you kind of -- you have to peel back the onion a little bit. If you look in energy, clearly, the strength of Brent has been helping RPC in terms of energy. If you look at the agricultural market, more recently, particularly you've seen a lot of strength in the sugar markets, and our ag markets are still very much commercially oriented, the OI is building, which suggests that the commercial participants in all of the markets continue to really play a strong role. And that tends to be a help in terms of the RPC. If you switch over to the cash equities side of the business, as Jeff alluded to, we've made very conscious decisions on business we don't want that's not profitable. And as we get out of those businesses, you see RPC trends up on the cash equities and options side as well. So it is -- it's not fee increases. It is very simply customer mix and then, frankly, decisions we're making on walking away from business that doesn't generate profit for us. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO, for any closing remarks. Jeffrey C. Sprecher: Well, thank you, all, for joining us. And we look forward to continuing to speak with you throughout the quarter, and have a good day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC Operator : Good morning and welcome to the ICE Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kelly Loeffler. Ms. Loeffler, please go ahead. Kelly Loeffler - Senior Vice President, Corporate Communications, Marketing & Investor Relations : Good morning. ICE's second quarter 2015 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of theice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements which we undertake no obligation to update represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements please refer to our 2014 Form 10-K. In addition to GAAP results we also refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including adjusted income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted expenses, adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted tax rate. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP term in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful as well as how management uses these measures. When used on this call net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses, adjusted net income refers to adjusted net income from continuing operations, and adjusted earnings refer to adjusted diluted continuing operations earnings per share. With us on the call are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Charles Vice, President and Chief Operating Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Scott. Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Kelly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll begin on slide four by highlighting our strong performance in the first half of 2015. We grew adjusted earnings 27% year-to-year on 6% revenue growth with commodities, cash equities, data services and listings all contributing top-line growth. Adjusted expenses declined 6% and adjusted margins expanded 6 points. The revenue growth and margin expansion generated operating cash flow of $770 million in the first half, which enabled us to deploy around $300 million in capital expenditures and business investments like Amex and OCC while returning $560 million to investors. Now please turn to slide five, where we detail our second quarter financial results. Adjusted earnings per share rose 27% from the prior year to $2.90. Net revenues grew 6% year-over-year to $797 million. This includes record revenues for data services and for NYSE listings and strong growth in commodities revenues. Adjusted operating expenses declined 8% from the prior second quarter and adjusted operating margin reached 59%. Our adjusted tax rate of 28% was at the lower end of our range in the quarter due to a number of discrete items. For the second half of the year we expect our tax rate to be closer to the middle of the 28% to 31% range. Let's move on to slide six, and I'll discuss the drivers of our 6% revenue growth. Transaction revenue accounted for 56% of net revenue during the second quarter. Our net transaction and clearing revenues declined 3% year-to-year due primarily to continued interest rate volume weakness in Europe. Commodities revenue increased 8% year-to-year on strength in our oil, natural gas and ag markets, and revenues also grew in our FX and cash equities markets. Non-transaction revenues grew 20% and represented 44% of net revenues. This included data services revenues, which were up 29% to a record $191 million, driven by the addition of new users and product offerings. NYSE listings revenues grew 12% year-to-year to a record $101 million, reflecting the NYSE's continued global leadership in IPOs and capital raisings. Next, on slide seven I'll detail the revenue performance across our futures exchanges for the second quarter. Despite muted activity in interest rate markets, revenues from futures and options declined just 2% from the prior second quarter. Energy and ag volume in revenue growth was solid, including global oil and sugar revenues, which increased 11% and 20% respectively versus the prior year. Total open interest across all of our exchanges has increased 3% from the beginning of 2015, and, notably, volatility in European short-term interest rates picked up during the month of July with daily volume in our rates complex up 17% over the prior July, contributing to overall derivatives volumes, which were up 1%. Total volumes in July actually grew 7% when you exclude European single stock equities volumes. The revenue associated with that trading activity is capped and, thus, there is very little correlation between volumes and revenue. To ensure our volume metrics better align with transaction revenues, we will exclude single stock equities volumes from our volume and RPC metrics beginning in August and we will provide updated historical information on that same basis on our website. Turning to slide eight, I'll expand on the performance of our energy markets. During the quarter, global oil revenue increased 11%, including Brent and Other Oil revenues, up 11% and 15% respectively. ICE Brent, along with hundreds of related oil products, remains the global benchmark relied upon by producers and consumers. Revenues also grew in gasoil and WTI, as did volume and open interest. From the beginning of the year through the end of June, open interest in our global oil complex is up 8%. Our natural gas markets also performed well in the second quarter, benefiting from increased volatility resulting in revenue and volume growth of 7% year-over-year. Moving along to slide nine, I'll provide an update on revenues from our swaps markets. Total credit derivatives revenues for the quarter were $34 million, including $22 million in CDS clearing revenues. This sequential decline in clearing revenues was primarily due to the $3 million accounting adjustment that we noted in our first quarter results. For the full year 2015, we expect clearing revenues to increase from the prior year and to exceed $100 million as we continue to add more products and see increased interest from buyside clients. Growth in European buyside participation continued in the quarter and accounted for 34% of the gross notional cleared in the first half at ICE Clear Credit, our U.S. swaps clearing house. CDS clearing activity in the U.S. remains robust due to our comprehensive product offering, portfolio margining and the relative regulatory certainty in the U.S. Please turn to slide 10. The New York Stock Exchange continues to grow revenue and gain share reaching 24.4% share of the U.S. cash equities market in the second quarter, up from 22.7% in the prior second quarter. We have improved revenue capture and grown revenue consistently since completing the acquisition in 2013 by focusing on the needs of our customers and simplifying markets. Share in our equity options markets was stable versus the first quarter. And after purchasing the remaining 16% stake in the Amex business at the end of June, we saw a share increase in July. Importantly, we will retain 100% of the profit from the Amex options business starting in the third quarter. So, in our equity options business, share is stable to improving, and the profit contribution from the business is increasing. We continue to focus on the evolution of our options market as we shift from a neutralized structure to one that is focused on innovating across the NYSE, Amex and Arca options markets. We've historically focused on aggregate expense management and revenue performance by business line. That notwithstanding, I want to eliminate any misperception about the significant profit contribution we are realizing from the New York Stock Exchange. The combination of improved share and stable revenue capture in cash equities continued listings leadership, diverse data offerings, the elimination of corporate redundancy and significant operational improvement increased NYSE's adjusted operating margin above 50% in the second quarter of 2015. That's a nearly twofold increase versus 2012. And as we continue to serve our customers, implement technology improvement and streamline NYSE's operations, we expect the profit contribution from the NYSE business to continue to increase as margins expand. Moving on to slide 11. As I just mentioned, we continued to extend our global leadership in listings in the second quarter and the first half of 2015. Listings revenue grew 12% over the prior second quarter to $101 million. We also led in global proceeds, raising $95 billion in 264 transactions during the first half of the year. We have a robust IPO pipeline for the second-half and we are investing in our team and resources to support our listed companies. Slide 12 reflects the continued strength of our data services business. For the quarter, data services revenues were a record $191 million, up 29% over the prior second quarter. This was primarily driven by the addition of new data products and growth in our customer base coupled with the addition of SuperDerivatives and the emergence of ICE Benchmark Administration. Turning to slide 13, I'll move from a focus on revenues to a discussion of our second quarter expenses. As you can see, adjusted expenses declined 8% year-over-year to $328 million. Expenses were better than guidance, primarily due to accelerated synergies coupled with reduced non-cash compensation expenses related to a large number of resource reductions during the quarter and a large recovery in technology expenses. Compensation, professional services and SG&A expenses continued to decline as we integrate our businesses, eliminate overlapping roles and reduce contractor levels. Technology and D&A expenses increased from the prior second quarter due to investment to improve our NYSE technology platform, to enhance our listed customer offerings and to enable our ongoing integration and the consolidation of our global real estate footprint. This continued focus on strong expense management enabled adjusted operating margins to expand to 59% in the second quarter, a 6-point improvement versus the prior year. We expect expenses in the third and fourth quarters to be in the range of $330 million to $335 million, which means our full-year expense should be at or slightly below the low-end of our prior guidance and approximately 4% lower than in 2014. If you move to slide 14, I'll quickly cover our cash flow and capital structure. In the first half of 2015 we generated $770 million in operating cash flow. At June 30 we had $700 million in unrestricted cash and short-term investment including just under $200 million in additional regulatory capital that will be required when ICE Clear Europe receives EMIR authorization. On June 30 we paid off our $1 billion 2015 euronotes. Our total debt now stands at $3.3 billion and our adjusted debt to EBITDA is 1.6 times. I'll conclude my remarks on slide 15 with an update on our uses of capital. As you can see we have used all of our operating cash for capital return, opportunistic M&A and capital expenditures. In the second quarter we returned nearly $290 million to our shareholders. We repurchased $203 million of shares during the second quarter and continued to opportunistically buy back our shares. We also paid $85 million in dividends, representing a 15% increase in demonstrating our commitment to grow dividends as we grow. We expect to maintain around $500 million in unrestricted cash and equivalents and a leverage ratio around 1.5 times. We otherwise expect to use 100% of cash flow to return capital to shareholders and to deploy towards growth investments that meet or exceed our return expectations. Importantly, our strong balance sheet and cash generation coupled with our access to debt market should enable us to return significant amount of capital without limiting in any material way our ability to act opportunistically when we identified growth opportunities. Our strong first-half performance reflects the execution of our financial and strategic objectives. Revenues grew 6% and adjusted earnings grew 27% even as we integrated multiple acquisitions, invested in growth initiatives and returned $560 million to shareholders. And importantly, we have established solid momentum that will carry through the remainder of this year and into 2016. I'll be happy to answer any questions during Q&A. And I'll now hand the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Scott, and good morning. Our 27% earnings growth in the quarter was driven by strength across our company. And our record first-half revenue and record first-half earnings are consistent with our objective of delivering strong top-line and bottom-line growth. We delivered growth in our energy, agriculture and equities markets, as well as in market data and in listings; we're integrating our acquired companies, and advancing numerous technology and strategic initiatives to address our customers' needs. Our team is adept at managing change, consistently evolving and growing our business since its inception. We've moved from an electronic trade execution venue for over-the-counter markets to becoming a global network of exchanges and more recently pursuing clearings, data services and expanding our listings franchise. And we're striking a balance between high value, recurring revenues and more commoditized volumetric revenues. Our progress in quickly reshaping historically low margin businesses to increase margins through improvements is evident in the NYSE and Liffe operations. Significant cost efficiencies remain in our sights; and as our revenues continue to rise, this should amplify our earnings growth in the coming years. We've also positioned ICE alongside long-term secular trends coupled with improving cyclical dynamics. And I'll walk through some f these starting on slide 16. Demand continues to rise for our products and services due to the globalization of markets and the increasing need for risk management. The significance of data services and clearing is rising with the additional collateral, treasury, benchmark and valuation services that we are developing. As such, much of the value we add today cannot be measured through trading volume. This is evident in the chart on slide 16 where trading volume trends have become a less reliable indicator of our earnings growth. Over the last four quarters, while trading volumes have declined on a year-over-year basis, our earnings per share has consistently grown at a strong double-digit rate. Our continued top-line revenue growth including revenues up 6% in the first half of the year is driven by our anticipation of changing customer needs. At the same time we compete in our trading volume based businesses from a position of strength, owning globally relevant benchmark contracts integrated with risk management and data services. We differentiated our approach by locating in the major market centers where our customers operate. As we reach for global growth, we plan to launch our Singapore-based exchange and clearing house in the fourth quarter and we built ICE Trade Vault data repositories in the U.S., Canada, Europe to serve unique reporting requirements. We believe that our geographic diversity is increasingly important as regulation and capital requirements continue to diverge across these jurisdictions. In response to customer requirements for products that are more capital efficient we've launched our ERIS products which replicate the economics available in swaps within a futures contract, while we are also taking a leading role in meeting the demand for swaps clearing in the U.S. and Europe. And, as you saw during July our leading European interest rate franchise demonstrated that when volatility returned during the month trading volumes responded with a 17% increase year-to-year, driven by Euribor and Sterling. We are very well positioned across our global financial products franchise including our MSCI index volumes, which are up more than 30% and foreign exchange volumes up more than 100% year-to-date through July. In our equities markets we're focused on innovating and growing the NYSE. We're introducing new technology, reducing market complexity and promoting liquidity by developing a mid-day auction. As the global leader in capital raising, we're focused on all aspects of our listings business. We continue to lead in IPOs across virtually all segments, including technology, REITs and ETFs. This is due to the clear advantages that we offer from our strong visibility, issuer advocacy and our unique market model which improves the ability of our listed companies to issue new equity or buy back their shares. Turning to slide 17, I'll highlight how our diverse global markets continue to provide near-term and long-term growth. Recently we've seen growth in our European rates and U.S. natural gas trading volumes, demonstrating how quickly volatility can return to markets. Longer term, as Western economies continue to move towards natural gas, we're very well positioned with over 100 listed natural gas contracts, including key natural gas benchmarks across the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Continental Europe. In our global oil complex we continue to benefit from price volatility and the demand for energy price hedging that is coming out of Asia through ICE Futures Europe. With nearly two decades of record annual volumes in the ICE Brent contract, there continue to be many drivers of its long-term volume growth. These include price volatility, changing supply and demand expectations, regulations, the adoption of Brent as a global oil benchmark, geopolitics and the shifts in hedging strategies. Turning to what's next, I mentioned earlier that we have a number of technology initiatives that are underway. For example, immediately after closing on the NYSE transaction, we began investing to reduce the complexity of the exchange's five trading platforms into one modern system. We plan to begin broad industry testing of our new NYSE Pillar platform over the next couple of months. I'll now turn to ICE Benchmark Administration and the important role that we're playing to rebuild confidence in the benchmark setting process. We've been working closely with the industry and regulators since beginning our work on LIBOR, and have deployed improved governance, transparency, systems and oversight that's required for this new era. With over $350 trillion in gross notional value that is tied to LIBOR, ICE Benchmark Administration is applying significant resources to reform the rate setting process. And through a market consultation that was announced last week, we're reviewing each aspects of LIBOR's methodology and calculations, including more transaction data included in the process. We've received very strong feedback from the 22 banks that are now submitting rates as part of our process. In addition, the new gold price auction has proceeded very well with record volume since its launch this year and with the number of direct participants expanding from 4 to 10 in the recent months. In our data services business we're working on building out our Safety network, which is an increasingly valuable piece of market infrastructure that we acquired with the NYSE. As secure connectivity becomes increasingly vital to market participants, we've seen strong interest in access to our network. I'll conclude on slide 18, which is the same slide on which Scott opened his remarks, in order to emphasize that we're delivering consistent growth by executing on our strategic plan. We're off to a great start in 2015 with record first-half revenues, record operating income and record earnings. We've transitioned from generating revenues that were approximately 90% transaction-based related to one asset class to an approximate 60% transaction-based revenue business that is now levered to multiple asset classes, multiple geographies and multiple growth drivers. This is why we're confident in our strategy. We've uniquely delivered growth each year through all phases of the business cycle. Our margins are rising; earnings growth is consistently strong; and we're delivering the best revenue and earnings performance in our history. And as we move into the back half and the coming year, we've identified significant opportunities across revenues and expenses that are yet to be realized to ensure that our strong track record continues. So on behalf of the ICE team, I want to thank our customers for trusting us with their business in this excellent quarter for us. And I'll now ask Keith, our operator, to open up the call for a question-and-answer session. Operator : Yes. Thank you. And the first question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks, guys. Maybe just an update on some of the regulatory items that are going on in the industry and, I guess, most importantly, probably equivalents and then (23:02) EMIR points. You mentioned, with Singapore launching, you're going to have the clearing houses in the exchanges globally. So I just wanted to get an update on your thoughts on where the potential concentration or where those end markets (23:16) will be going depending on how some of these regulations turn out? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Why don't I move \u2013 I'll move geographically across the globe. So starting with the U.S., we've been participating in a number of panels and hearings and conversations that have been going on with the CFTC regarding the potential implementation of position limits and how those should go into markets. Particularly, we're concerned about how the commodity markets operate. I think you're aware that we built our business around the commercial users of hedging tools and commodities. And we are trying to make sure that those kinds of reliable and diligent people have access to markets so that they can use them to hedge and continue to manage risk in their businesses. I feel like that constituency is much more engaged now in this conversation and our regulators are listening and trying to find their way through that. So, honestly, we feel like there is a very good, healthy dialogue going on in the United States. And we feel like, as a company, we've positioned ourselves with the right group of customers to continue to grow as we have been through all phases of increased regulation in the United States. In Europe, you mentioned the equivalents conversation. We're deeply involved in the conversations on both sides of that. Publicly, the regulators have stated that they're moving closer to a deal. It looks like, to us, from basically everything we see, that they are working in earnest, that a deal is within sight. We think that they've done a very good job of gathering a lot of data, so that the policies that they implement will be data-driven, which has been important for us and we've participated in providing data and running analytics and scenarios so that people can be educated. So we feel good about the direction of that and have no reason to believe that they won't come to a deal as they \u2013 both sides have suggested they are moving towards. Based on our conversations, it looks like the areas that they're negotiating over would be helpful for the markets in that it will continue to allow for strong risk management but won't necessarily impede or significantly change the way people do business. Moving to Asia, we are anxious to launch our Singapore exchange in clearinghouse. We've done all the work that we've needed to do, put the staff in place, the systems in place, and are basically ready to go, but we really benefit as a company from being a global network, a global distribution, and our goal is to bring a lot of non-traditional global players to Singapore to do business. And so, it's taken our customers longer to get set up than we anticipated. We don't want to launch the exchange until major customers can have access. We think the best \u2013 it was in our best interest to slow down and give our customers a chance to catch up to us, and so we're now planning that in the fourth quarter of this year we think there'll be significant mindshare there around the exchange that will allow us to have a successful launch. That's kind of the lay of the land, it's all work in progress but broadly speaking a lot of really good healthy dialog going on across the world as regulators are struggling to implement a lot of new rule changes but do it in a way that's consistent globally and also that doesn't impede people that are trying to use the markets in healthy ways. Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. That's helpful. And then, Scott, you gave an update on the second half on expenses. They continue to be well managed, but just wanted to get an update on 2016 and 2017 just on the synergy timeline, if anything's changed or more or less in line with what you've said in the past. Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer : No. I think, Mike, we continue to make very good progress on the projects that made us that $550 million of synergies. As I mentioned the performance in the quarter really reflects an acceleration of those synergies and the efforts around it. So I feel good about the projects we've identified, I feel good about the progress that we're making, and we continue to be very focused not just on the synergies but on expense management generally. Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Ken Hill with Barclays. Kenneth W. Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer : Good morning. Kenneth W. Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Just wanted to kind of follow up there last on the Singapore exchange. I know the timeline's been a little bit more drawn up than you guys initially expected, but you've mentioned the fourth quarter launch you have customers get on board. I was hoping you could remind us as to what your initial goals are as we turn into 2016 what we should be looking for there with the Singapore exchange. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Really, as managers, our hope is that we have a successful launch. We have a handful of products that we have talked to a lot of customers about in Asia that they want to trade, and we want to have a successful launch of the exchange, get people used to using the exchange in clearing house, get the connectivity around it and so \u2013 and be able then to plug that into our global distribution network. And the goal is to just have this nice, successful launch because we have the intention of launching a lot of new products and there's a lot of demand coming from our Asian customers for new products in the region. So what you see us doing is trying to find a couple of products that we think will have appeal, that the appeal will be broad enough that it will bring global distribution to Asia. But, the real intent there is not that any one of those things is necessarily a homerun, we want to have a solid start to the business because we do intend to continue to invest in there and there really does seem to be strong demand for trading in the region. Kenneth W. Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And just a follow-up on CDS business, I know you guys on the slide deck have the target there for clearing revenues of above $100 million. Versus where we were in 2Q I know you had some one-off adjustments. Can you give us some color on what you're hearing from clients that gives you a little bit more confidence in that greater than $100 million number? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. That's a really good question, Ken. And really our willingness to commit that we'll be over $100 million for the year is based on customer feedbacks. We're seeing a lot of positive momentum now with buyside customers in particular and single-names and importantly in advance of any mandate. I mean, we've got mandates from the CFTC on indexes, but we don't have mandates in single-name and that notwithstanding we're seeing growth in interest because I think there is a view that for the market to really succeed, clearing is an important element of that. And so you've seen a couple buyside firms that have written about that, we have the most comprehensive offering of single-name products, the most comprehensive offering of sovereign names, have talked \u2013 talked about our intention during the second half to launch the U.K., France and Germany sovereign names. So I'm encouraged by the product launches that we have in front of us, the buy-side customer feedback that we're getting and just the nature of the business that we've built which I think provides not only a foundation for us to do well the rest of this year but to continue to grow out into 2016 and 2017. Kenneth W. Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks. That's helpful color. Thanks for taking my question. Operate: Thank you. And the next question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Yeah. Good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Scott. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer : Good morning. Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Congrats on the strong quarter here. I guess my first question is on the market data and, Jeff, you spent a fair amount of time emphasizing on calls and this demand for more data by the customers and what you do \u2013 that it isn't just price increases, but it's content increases too. So I guess could you get into more color on what exactly you're providing the value here? And then, Scott, you said it was going to be \u2013 or I think the guidance was flat; it grew by $4 million. So, where can it go for the next couple of quarters? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. So I think the trend that we see and that we saw and have moved towards is this demand for more and more data. We all know, all of us that follow this industry saw the emergence of algorithmic traders that were consuming a lot of data and then figuring out very quickly how to place trades, well that kind of an analytics is now making its way on to desktops and into buyside firms and people now are increasingly having the capability to handle a lot of data and to analyze it and to find trends or other opportunities or to use it for risk management and hedging activities in this dataset. And one of the things that has the nice luxuries of the company that we've built is that we've now moved into multiple asset classes as you've seen, including over-the-counter products, listed commodities and listed derivatives and now equities and equity options, and we've done that globally. And so we have quite a package of data and are able to put things together in interesting ways to help serve the needs of our customers. And so, when we were a small company our data wasn't this rich and honestly we didn't have as deep of appreciation as how data was going to be consumed as we do today. So what you've seen us do is put Lynn Martin now in charge of a new data operation to organize across all of our businesses to gather data, and it's paying dividends. Like Scott mentioned in his prepared remarks that revenues were up 20% in that area which is \u2013 or 20% across our fixed businesses and 29% in data, which is an interesting place for us to position the company, it's why Scott and I both mentioned in our prepared remarks. We think we're just scratching the surface. We just are integrating these businesses, we just put Lynn as an executive to oversee the integration and so we have strong appetite, we think, to continue to grow these businesses. Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer : And I won $10, Rich, that you called me out on my guidance being a little off. The point I've made is the \u2013 it's an expansive business that Lynn is running. It's through traditional data services that ICE has had where we sold data in the back offices that allow them to mark their books. The Safety business at NYSE that Jeff talked about in his prepared remarks where people want to get connectivity into our exchange, it's direct connect into ICE's exchanges. And so there are a number of pieces that move around, the overall visibility is good not perfect. My expectation is the data services revenues are going to grow strongly every single quarter. Sequentially, I still think a relatively accurate projection for the year is that 3Q and 4Q look like 2Q. Could it be a couple of million higher in those some of those quarters based on the more connections or greater data sales or continued customer growth or SuperDerivatives' performance? It could be. I think that's the conservative assumption. I think the more important point versus what do we think about the third quarter or the fourth quarter is what do we think long-term, and this is a growth business for us. And it's a significant growth opportunity for us as you move into 2016 and then out into 2017. Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Got it. I'll rebate you that $10, Scott. My follow-up question, Jeff, would be every quarter you position the company as a growth company and it has been. And I guess it has to do with the NYSE and you've talked a lot about the improvement in margins of 50% and the growth and now you're 100% of the Amex contribution; I'd love to understand what that is. But I guess the bigger question now is once the synergies are done and looking at the company, the key \u2013 if revenue was \u2013 wanted revenue to grow mid-single digits, can you still grow when you don't have the synergies? And then looking at the NYSE, again, I would assume a lot of the growth is from cost savings and I know you've done well with market share but the point being, you may not be getting the value for that either. So again the question about growth after the synergies are done at the NYSE and the valuation there. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, you're right in that. We've taken a lot of costs out of the business and we've been able to do that because we're a larger organization that can lever off of other businesses. And there's more to go there. We still haven't put our technology in place, we're making large investments in the way we oversee our markets and compliance and other tools that we think will really make us a better compliance organization and more efficient. So there's still a lot to go there on the expense side, but we've really been growing revenues. And this idea that we had in simplifying markets we now want to simplify technology, we are really \u2013 have a new team in place that's really pursuing a lot of listings and the top-line is growing. And we think the trends are in our favor. We're going to put a mid-day auction in, the SEC has worked with us on a tick pilot that's going to go into place that's going to test various market models around the listed business. And we see potential upside in all of that. The other thing that happens, Rich, is that, what, the exhaust of the New York Stock Exchange is a pretty rich dataset. And that dataset is something, along with the Safety network that we inherited with that, is something that we've now been exploiting to add to it and enrich it with other data. And so, we think that we will be able to grow the top-line of that business when you look at it collectively for years to come. Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : So, I guess the point is you think you can grow earnings post-synergies? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Oh yes. Absolutely. Absolutely. And we don't see right now any limitations. And the levers that we're pulling seem to be working and the trends, really. All things being equal, we really believe that buyers are looking for sellers and sellers are looking for buyers, and that markets don't want to be fragmented. The fragmentation comes when there's payment for order flow where intermediaries are incented to do something on their personal behalf, and less so on their customer behalf. Where algorithmic traders benefit from the fragmentation, where corporate traders may not have balance sheet attached to their \u2013 the use of the corporate balance sheet attached to their pay. And so they are looking for economic incentives and will actually trade slightly off-market in order to lower execution costs, if you will, that they get paid against. And so you have a lot of disincentives in the markets that have caused a lot of fragmentation, and as there's more regulation, as there's more focus on the bottom-line, as people are really having a really healthy debate about the fiduciary responsibility of exchanges and brokers and intermediaries, those trends are allowing what the natural market wants, which is for buyers to find sellers and for these things to come back to more organized listed venues. And we've seen that trend. I'd like to say that everything we're doing has caused it, but it's not, that is not the cause. There is a macro trend in place that we're moving the business into. Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Understood. Thanks. Very helpful, Jeff. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good morning. I guess one more question on market data. You talked about the growth in new users, and I was wondering if there's any kind of stats or kind of good color you can put around where they're coming from geographically or anything to be a little more helpful there. Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. I mean, not a lot that we put out publicly on that, but what I can tell you is similar to what I said in the first quarter. We saw a lot of growth in the energy space in particular and, more narrowly, interest in oil markets, which is not surprising if you look at what's happening. There's a lot of growth in the world in oil, a lot of new sources of oil, a lot of discussion around the oil markets, and so that's an area where we've seen a significant growth in the number of customers. And then the other thing I mentioned earlier is it's not just an interest in the data, but we're seeing more customers grow. I forget what the number was, but I think we were up something like 30% in terms of people who are buying access to our exchanges. And so, it's growth in data consumption in energy, it's growth in connectivity in energy, and then, as Jeff alluded to, there's a lot of valuable information at the New York Stock Exchange as well, and we continue to see more customers who are interested in consuming that data. So it's across the business. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Great. And then just on M&A and your kind of outlook today versus other periods, how much time you guys are thinking you're spending on potential acquisitions and how you would characterize the environment today for potential activity? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, there's definitely a lot of opportunities available for M&A in the market. We see it \u2013 similarly, there's a lot of private equity firms that are coming to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and some of those companies are not really ready for listing and those private equity firms have been looking to sell them privately. So we see activity on both sides. Nothing has changed for us. We are driven by return on invested capital metrics and where we can place our money so that it has the highest return for shareholders, as part of that graph that we have shown, which is we like to buy businesses, not to own them but where we think we can transform them because of the unique nature of the network we've put together. And so they become high value, high return on invested capital businesses for us, so we'll always look at things like that, but we weigh them against the other opportunities we have in the way we can return capital to shareholders or reinvest in organic growth. And I would say nothing has changed other than it does seem like there's a lot of private equity-based companies around that are looking for new owners both in the public and private markets. Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer : And just extending that point, in the first slide in the appendix we do put out each quarter what our return on invested capital is. And as I said, I thought we'd be by the end of the year, we're now back at 8% and it's above our cost of capital. So just to build on Jeff's point, we do focus on return on invested capital as we think about investments, as we think about synergies in the businesses we buy and the integration plans for those acquisitions. I think that's an important milestone. The ROIC for our company remains above that of our closer competitors, and more importantly it's back above cost of capital which means every day we come to work we're creating value for shareholders. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Good morning. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC : Just wanted to ask quickly about the \u2013 I don't think you mentioned, the Russell-FTSE agreement that CME just struck, and maybe also give a little bit of history there. I remember when you've taken this over you were very excited, I think you paid a pretty big price for it to get that over and it never took off. So maybe just what happened? Why did it never become a big area for you? Why did you not get more competitive in keeping this contract? And what's the profitability or impact when that is going to CME in the future? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. So let me answer the second part first, which is the move away from us is immaterial to us. And the reason that that happened is really the first part of your question, which is what we found in marketing the Russell complex was that the natural hedging user, which is always our target customer, is a large institutional buyside or smaller \u2013 medium institutional buyside that has a mid-cap or small-cap U.S. portfolio that wants to hedge that. What we found is very strong competition from our competitor who was marketing to that same asset base, the use of the S&P 500 as the hedging instrument. And the Russell indices and the S&P 500 had become very highly correlated, and so there was very robust competition. The deal we struck had the cost of that marketing borne by us and over time we had been putting in more and more market making programs and other incentives to try to attract liquidity that was lowering our rate per contract and lowering the take that ICE got out of that deal. And so, it is now moving to that competitor, it's going into a vertical, it's going to be exclusive and basically the market's going to be carved up by the index providers and their distributor on those economics. We understand why they would want to do that. It's not material, the loss is not material to us. The thing we find incongruous, however, is claims that somehow that that is pro-competition or somehow this is open access, when in reality it's exactly the opposite. It's a market carve up putting all those in one place and have the economics split between people. A similar thing has happened with respect to the equity side of the Russell business which has moved exclusively recently to CBOE. Again, CBOE being a person that \u2013 an equity options exchange that puts out unique content, has been very successful in its unique content. And a decision made to put all that together in a vertical and carve up the economics. Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC : All right. Great. And then, maybe secondly, for Scott, I guess, capital returns have come up a few times already, but if I just look at your buybacks here, around $200 million per quarter over the last three quarters. Absent any other things I think is that a good range to think about for now? And then in general how do you feel about, again, absent any sort of M&A, adding more leverage to balance sheet, any recent discussions with the ratings agencies? I know you're just getting to know them still, but how do you feel about leverage in general? Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer : As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our leverage target is still 1.5 times. I think that's where \u2013 we'll need to be around that in order to maintain the current rating we have, which is important to us as clearing house operators. I also mentioned that we will maintain about a $500 million cash balance. After that it's our intention, as I said in our prepared remarks, is to continue to return cash to shareholders as we have been doing. If you look, I think it was slide 15 in the deck, we've already returned almost $600 million this year, that's versus around $900 million for the full-year last year. We've, as you mentioned, been very consistent in buying back our shares because I think it clearly expresses the view that we think that is the best investment and the best use of our capital and we've grown our dividend. So I think what you should continue to expect is other than CapEx and to the extent we find M&A that generates higher return on invested capital, we're going to continue to deploy our cash strongly towards share repurchases and dividends. Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC : All right. Very good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, folks. Scott, maybe if you could, just talk a little bit more about the expense outlook trajectory as we move into the fourth quarter. I think you said last quarter that the expenses could trend \u2013 that trajectory could trend down into the fourth quarter and then as we move into the first quarter 2016. I think a couple of quarters ago you gave guidance on the expense synergy realization road map and obviously, I think you're tracking ahead of that. So just maybe an update on, I think the $450 million of annualized expense synergies that you thought you'd be at a run rate basis in 1Q 2016, if you think you might be ahead of that, and maybe what is that number as of 2Q, as of this quarter? Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. I think what's really important is to focus on our overall expense trajectory and the margin expansion that you're seeing. We're three years removed almost from announcing the deal, almost two years removed from closing the deal. In the intervening period of the time, we bought four new businesses, we've invested in growing organically our internal businesses. So we're really very focused on our overall expense trajectory. Inside that, we are well on track towards our synergy objectives. As I said in the quarter, you mentioned that it was going to decelerate over the course of the year, but synergies actually accelerated into the second quarter, and so if you look at the guidance relatively, we're now at or likely, slightly below our full-year guidance. If you'd taken the mid-point of our original guidance, it was down 3%. We're now down 4%, and that's against the backdrop of growing revenues. The other thing, I think, that's important is we just don't manage expenses through synergies. We manage expenses across all of our businesses. And so as we move forward, we're going to be really focused on what is the net trajectory of our overall expenses. We expect those expenses to continue to improve, which will allow margins to continue to expand. And I think the real visibility to our progress is going to be found in the margin expansion, which, as I mentioned, in the quarter, 6 points up year-to-year to 59%; right on track, frankly, to where we thought we'd be a couple years ago. Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Yeah, I know, it sounds like that trajectory would have you at a lower overall expense rate as we get into the fourth quarter and particularly given the projects that you're working on for NYSE with the margins over 50% for the NYSE business. Is that fairly accurate? Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Again, I think we gave pretty clear guidance on where we thought third quarter and fourth quarter would be. I definitely think the trends are positive because embedded in that guidance, frankly, are investments to enable, as Jeff said earlier, improvements in our compliance functions and the efficiency of that organization. It's investments that are necessary to integrate our SuperDerivatives acquisition, our Holland Clearing House acquisition, so despite those investments, which are reflected in the third quarter and fourth quarter guidance, the expenses will be down year-to-year. And then once those investments are made, we'll realize the benefit of them as we move into 2016. Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks. And then maybe just back on the market data, it sounds like you've got great traction in the core businesses. If you can, comment about SuperDerivatives a little bit and the ICE Benchmark Administration from a revenue contribution? Is that \u2013 were they not as bigger growth contributors in the second quarter? And then as we move into 2016, do you expect them, both of them to become much more meaningful in that growth trajectory? Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. So we gave guidance at the beginning of the year that I think was we expected our acquisition to be $50 million to $55 million in revenues. And that was largely SuperDerivatives and that was incremental revenue. And I think we're largely right on track to that. And what I would suggest to you is that's not inconsistent with their prior year performance. I do expect as we move into 2016 that that business can grow for us, because what we're doing right now is we're really integrating it, we're leveraging their resources to help us build out our clearing offerings. And so, I think as we get that business more integrated, invest in resources to expand it, it will certainly contribute to growth as it moves into 2016. So, I'd characterize SuperDerivatives as pretty much on track to what we thought it would be this year and definitely a growth opportunity in the next year. And look, ICE Benchmark Administration is still a relatively new business. We've just recently kicked off the Gold Fix, the ICE swap rate is still relatively new. And so I definitely do that business \u2013 it's certainly already contributing this year, but I do think it's a business that can grow next year and we're making significant investments in that business to help it grow as we move into the future. Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Great. Good morning, everybody. The question for you guys on just what's been, kind of, going on in the oil markets more recently, specifically curious if you could give us a little more color on any changes in, kind of, participation or client behavior we saw this time around with the slide in July versus what was happening at the end of the last year; producers versus consumers versus, kind of, financial folks, who's been more or less active on that front? Thanks. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, it's interesting, well I think the major trend that you'll see is that open interest is moved higher and is up at record levels and so there is a lot of interest in those markets. I think a lot of lay people think, oh, if the price is going down then nobody is interested in using it for hedging, but the reality is people that buy oil want to try to buy it at a low price and lock in low prices. And so these are two-sided markets and there's always one side that's interested in whatever the trend is, up or down, and that's how ultimately we would make a market. So, we still are very focused on commercial users. You'll see in the commitment of trader reports that we file publicly that we continue to see very, very strong commercial interest in the oil markets. We have a large \u2013 we talk a lot about Brent because it's our flagship and it's now become a regulated benchmark, and has become a global benchmark. But, we have many, many other oil products, including gasoil. Gasoil, you may recall, we changed the specifications to make it closer to diesel fuel. And we also changed the settlement date on that. And so we had a lot of movement around gasoil. And that happened over the last 18 months or so. That's all in place now and what you're seeing is volumes of gasoil trading have also been rising now that that contract has landed on its ultimate design. So, we feel pretty good about that business from all of, long-term, from all of those trends that we're seeing. Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got you. And then, Scott, just one for you, on the 100% retention of NYSE Amex, I'm not sure if I missed it, but what does that mean for the kind of operating results of the company on kind of whole pre-tax basis? Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer : We haven't disclosed what the dollar amounts are. I don't want to be trite and tell you it means we get to keep 100% of it, but that's really effectively, we've moved from getting 84% to 100%. It's not, in the scheme of things, it's not a huge amount. For that business, it's important, because what we've seen, you've seen us walk away from volumes that aren't helping to deliver profit to the bottom-line. There has been some impacts around some of those volumes as we worked our way through that Amex partnership. I think now what you saw in the first quarter and in the second quarter you see it even more clearly share seems to have stabilized, it was actually a little bit better in July versus what we saw in the second quarter. So, generally, with that business, what we're seeing is stable share, relatively stable rate capture, and as we've bought back that profit, an improving profitability to the business overall. Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Ken Worthington, with JPMorgan. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Okay. I think this is question six on data, so I apologize. But, as we think about growing data revenue and earnings going forward, how you are thinking about the opportunity of growing the business that goes beyond ICE's proprietary data? You've got LIBOR, Gold Fix, I guess SuperDerivatives is in there as well. What are really the next steps for growth beyond ICE's own data? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, first of all, I think maybe implicit in your question is the notion that our data is the data that is the obvious data, which is the output of trading. But, the other thing that we believe that we have that is unique content that has yet to have been developed. Because of our broad relationship with a lot of companies and the way we touch them, there is a lot of, let's say, non-trade data that we collect through the various ways we touch our customers than can be organized up and potentially have value back into the market. And we are building through the team that we have at SuperDerivatives more predictive capabilities and analytical capabilities to take all of that rich dataset and put it into context. And we think that would, sort of, be the next leg up. Couple that with the fact that we made a decision, we didn't talk a lot about it at the time but we made a decision when we spun off a lot of the NYSE technology businesses to actually keep the network that's called Safety so that we have better distribution into our client base, and more importantly in a world where people are concerned about security, and we are hyper-concerned about security, we think that the trends on the way data is delivered are going to move towards very, very highly secured relationships between us and our customers and we've got this great infrastructure to do that. So, all of those are more than just selling the trade data, the exhaust that comes out of it; exchanges and all of the things that I mentioned as growth opportunities are quite high value and there are things that when we talked to customers increasingly they are telling us that they are willing to pay for those. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Perfect. And just lastly, China is topical today. I think both CME and Virtu had some sort of disclosure or announcement. Updated thoughts in terms of tapping China, you've got Singapore launching next quarter. I think initially you were going to do lookalike contracts. Have you, kind of, circled back on the China strategy? And if so, what are your thoughts today? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : First of all we do have an FX franchise and we have the dollar index and I would just mention that RMB is not a part of the dollar index. It's been a conversation we've had for a couple years, but \u2013 so, with respect to FX it's had no real impact on us. That's China FX that has no real impact on us. Our China strategy is we want to open an exchange and clearing house in Singapore. Honestly, we don't have a \u2013 it is a very hard nut to crack in financial services. The government there has made it very clear that they're going to control access to markets in and out, and so what we want to do is be positioned in the region. And having \u2013 we are in constant dialogs over there. We have an office in China and colleagues that are working on improving our position every day, but it is a difficult area to penetrate in the financial services space and personally I understand why that is and don't begrudge their government for wanting to have controls over that as they move their population into the middle-class. So in any event, long story short, this Singapore launch for us is strategic and important. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes the question-and-answer session. So, at this time, I would like to turn the call back over to management for any closing comments. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, thank you, Keith, and thank you all for joining us on the call. We'll continue to report on our future results in future calls like this. And have a good day. Operator : Thank you. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kelly Loeffler, please go ahead. Kelly Loeffler : Good morning. ICE's third quarter 2015 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of theice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements which we undertake no obligation to update represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements please refer to our 2014 Form 10-K. In our earnings supplement we refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including adjusted income, operating margin, expenses, EPS, EBITDA and tax rate. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP terms in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful as well as how management uses these measures. When used on this call net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses, adjusted net income refers to adjusted net income from continuing operations, and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted continuing operations earnings per share. With us on the call are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Chuck Vice, President and Chief Operating Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Scott. Scott Hill : Thank you, Kelly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will begin on Slide 4 with some highlights of our strong performance through the first nine months of 2015. Our overall revenues grew 7% versus the prior year. Transaction revenues were up thanks to strength in our commodities markets as well as in our U.S. cash equities market. Our data services revenue grew 22% and listings revenues grew 11%. In addition to solid top line growth, adjusted operating expenses declined 5% from the prior year, which enabled adjusted operating margins to expand 5 points to 59%. All of this combined to generate 26% year-over-year growth in our adjusted earnings per share and we generated $890 million in operating cash flow in the first nine months of this year enabling us to return nearly $850 million to shareholders, while continuing to invest in our business. Please turn to Slide 5, where I will discuss our third-quarter performance. Our adjusted earnings per share rose 24% from the prior third quarter to $2.91. Net revenues grew 10% year-over-year to $816 million. This was driven by record quarterly data services and listings revenue and solid growth across commodities and U.S. cash equities. While revenues grew, adjusted operating expenses declined 2% year-to-year to $337 million and margins expanded 5 points to 59%. Operating expenses were slightly above our guidance due to a true-up in our bonus accrual for the full-year reflecting our expectation that we will exceed our challenging 2015 financial objectives with notable strength in our commodities and in particular our data services business. Our pay-for-performance culture rewards our team and our results exceed the appropriately high expectations of ICE investors. Importantly though, well over 85% of that overachievement dropped straight to our bottom line. Our strong third-quarter results cemented our path to record results for the full-year. Moving now to Slide 6, I will highlight our third-quarter net revenues of $816 million, which were up 10% year-to-year. Transaction revenues accounted for 56% of our total revenues and increased 3% year-to-year. Our transaction revenues are diversified across nine asset classes, which benefit from both secular and cyclical trends and include our energy revenues that grew 5% during the quarter. The remaining 44% of total net revenues were subscription or what we previously referred to as non-transaction revenues. Those revenues increased 20% over the prior third-quarter. Our subscription revenues encompass our data services offerings, including proprietary data, connectivity and valuation and benchmark products from SuperDerivatives and ICE Benchmark Administration. These revenues also include our listings business, which continues to lead in helping our customers raise the capital they need to grow their businesses. I'll provide some additional detail on revenues on Slide 7. Within transaction revenues, commodities revenues grew 5% year-to-year due to strength across our energy and Ag markets supported by ongoing price volatility. In addition U.S. cash equities revenues were up double-digits year-to-year. Though financial revenues declined, we continue to expand our product offering and are well-positioned when the European economy begins to improve. As you can also see we generated record data services revenue of $209 million in the third quarter, which was up 24% year-to-year as we continue to attract new users and offer new services such as those provided by SuperDerivatives and ICE Benchmark Administration. And finally you will note that listings revenues of $101 million increased 10% year-to-year and remained at record levels, which is a testament to the strength of the NYSE market model and our unrelenting focus on remaining the leading capital raising platform for companies around the world. Next on Slide 8, I will discuss our third quarter adjusted operating expenses. Expenses during the quarter declined 2% to $337 million. Adjusted operating margins expanded 5 points to 59%. The 4% increase in compensation and benefit is the result of the higher bonus accrual we made during the quarter to reflect the outstanding results we believe we will deliver for the full-year 2015. Professional services expenses as well as SG&A and rent expenses declined double-digit year-to-year as we continue to integrate the NYSE. And finally, strategic investments in our business caused technology and D&A expenses to increase modestly compared to last year's third quarter. I will conclude my third quarter remarks on Slide 9 with a review of our solid cash generation and capital returns. At September 30th, we had $708 million in unrestricted cash and short-term investments and an adjusted debt to EBITDA of 1.6 times. During the first nine months of 2015 we generated $890 million of operating cash which enabled us to invest in growth and to return nearly $850 million to our shareholders through dividends and buy backs. And by the end of this year even though we've now suspended our share repurchase program pending the close of the Interactive Data deal, including the share repurchases completed in October and the dividend that we will pay during the fourth quarter, we will return nearly $1 billion to shareholders during 2015. We are on track for a record year in 2015, including solid revenue growth, operating margin expansion, double-digit earnings growth and significant capital returns to our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey Sprecher : Thank you, Scott and good morning. Today I am pleased to report on one of the best quarters in our company's history and to share the strategic vision for the continued evolution of our company. Before I discuss ICE's expanded data services opportunity, I want to first highlight our diverse range of growth opportunities. I'm often asked how we plan to grow revenues over the long term. So I will begin with a few of these drivers on Slide 10. These are just a few of the areas that give us confidence in our ongoing double-digit earnings growth. Many of the areas listed on this slide; energy, listings, data, and U.S. equities contributed to our 10% revenue growth and our 24% earnings growth during the third quarter. I'm pleased to note that on November 17th, our initiative to serve the growing demand for trading, clearing and risk management in Asia will launch as ICE Futures Singapore and ICE Clear Singapore. Our initial products include Mini Brent and gasoil futures, gold and Mini RMB futures and we expect to expand the range of tools we offer based on the needs of our customers as market participants demand more risk management services in the Asian region. Moving on to Slide 11, I will turn to our unique growth opportunity in data services. Today our data business includes a growing number of subscription services ranging from trading and settlement data to data delivery to Analytics. Trading and settlement data comes directly from our exchanges and clearing houses including real-time, view-only, historical and customized data. Our data delivery services help our customers connect or receive our data using co-location or as well as our secure conductivity known as the Safety Network. And the Analytics tools that we have acquired and developed that make raw data more meaningful, such as index price creation, benchmarks, valuations and forward pricing curves for the commodities and financial markets. This area includes products from SuperDerivatives and will include products from Interactive Data Corporation following the closing of our transaction in the coming months. What we see is more customers using data to inform their trading decisions and increasingly their capital allocation decisions. So we are focused on harnessing our data in the more usable value-added information that our customers can easily consume to make more educated risk management decisions and comply with regulatory requirements. Next on Slide 12 I would like to offer some additional insight into our recently announced Interactive Data Corporation transaction. Interactive Data is a leading provider of financial market data, analytics and related distribution solutions. It serves virtually all of the world's major financial institutions and asset managers. The majority of Interactive Data's revenue approximately 70% comes from providing evaluated pricing of hard to value, thinly traded, fixed income securities. The other 30% is derived from widely distributed data and technology platforms. What we see is the opportunity to leverage this valuable asset to innovate for our customers while creating tremendous value for shareholders. ICE is a consistent earnings-per-share growth company that has recognized industry trends early and placed ourselves at their intersection in order to innovate around change. Recall that in 2007 we acquired the New York Board of Trade in order to gain access to clearing technology, believing that we could make clearing a strategic business rather than a back-office function. We took this newly acquired clearing technology and launched one of the world's most important commodity clearing houses in London. We then built on this technology to take $65 trillion of credit derivatives off the books of the world's largest financial institutions. As part of the NYSE Euronext transaction we expanded this technology to include the interest rate and equity derivatives markets and most recently we've adapted this platform to serve the Asian markets. This robust, sophisticated technology calculates the value of millions of clear trading positions around the world every day. NYSE Euronext also brought us an equity value calculator that is relied upon the value our 95% market share of ETF listings. We acquired SuperDerivatives last year for its ability to value complex instruments and trading positions particularly in the foreign exchange space. We built ICE Benchmark Administration and now calculate the LIBOR rates, the value of interest rate swaps known as the ICE Swap Rate, the London Gold Price. And in October we will calculate the same valuation parameters for the initial margining of bilateral swaps. So all of this breezes to Monday when ICE announced its agreement to acquire Interactive Data, the foremost valuation provider in the global fixed income market. Energy, agriculture, credit, interest rate futures, interest rate swaps, LIBOR, equities, equity derivatives, exchange traded funds, foreign exchange, gold and now fixed income instruments; ICE is becoming one of the world's foremost providers of tools and information that's needed to value risk whether that's found on-exchange off-exchange or in the cash markets. So what is this trend that we are targeting? It's the increasing need for more information to optimize capital efficiency when you manage risk. And as bank balance sheets have become constrained and as regulation requires collateral for all risk positions we believe that there will be increasing demand for the data, information and solutions after the cost of holding, hedging and managing risk. And we have demonstrated our willingness to invest, to be a trusted source in this important area. When we started working on ICE in the late 1990s, exchanges were largely regional businesses. In fact, they recognized this and actually had the location in their name. The New York Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Metal Exchange, the Deutsche Borse, the Hong Kong Exchange, so you get my drift here. The move to electronic trading and to the Internet transformed many of these regional businesses into global business improving their market access. And as they lost their borders, exchanges became more competitive with one another, listing each other's products and beginning to fragment market liquidity. Additionally some players started the lobby government to adopt rules to even further fragment liquidity, in order to benefit broker intermediaries, high-frequency traders as well as exchanges that are seeking regulatory solutions to their commercial challenges. So this resulted in regulation [NMAP] in the United States and MiFID and MiFID II in Europe. Market fragmentation means that not all buyers will find their lowest cost sellers and vice versa. So this fosters informational asymmetries where certain market participants and intermediaries will benefit from arbitrage opportunities. And since many buyers and sellers can't or won't make the technology investment required to find the best price in a more complex market, they compensate brokers and intermediaries that have made the investments in the technology and the data to do so. So as markets fragment the value of data increases and the matching of buyers and sellers on exchanges decreases on a relative basis, with some execution venues actually paying users to match orders. Why would they do that, because as exchanges unbundle their execution services they can address the widening bid offer spreads that fragmentation brings by providing market access and market data. So what you see in our business is now a directional shift of the mix from transaction-based revenues towards recurring subscription-based revenues as the market evolution transfers value to these needed services. In other words when regulators unbundle exchange trading and clearing, exchanges have typically gone even further and unbundled the matching technology from data, access, oversight, and valuation services. And as such these fragmented markets create increased opportunities to provide valuation services, such as Interactive Data has found in the highly fragmented cash bond markets. With a 98% revenue renewal rate, one of the highest revenue renewal rates that I've ever seen in any business, the market obviously craves an authoritative source for consistent, reliable price discovery. And where regulatory and structural issues keep markets balkanized or fragmented these valuation services prosper. Another trend that we are tapping into is the increasing sophistication of risk managers who value more real-time information rather than simply end of day mark. They also demand better analytical tools to help them consume real-time information. The growing trends towards investments and exchange traded funds and passive index investing is also increasing the demand for real-time evaluated pricing to support the innovation of these products. And we see markets like cash bonds and swaps moving from exclusive voice trading to hybrid voice and electronic trading, which is demanding the trusted evaluated pricing to encourage screen based [liquidities] and confidence in those prices that are displayed. Take all of these trends together and you can see a very positive environment for ICE's risk management tools to grow. So we are taking a very strategic approach to evaluating our company and evolving it and an ever-increasing provider of value added services. I'd like to thank our customers for their business in the last quarter and I'm going to turn the call back over to Scott, who will close out the call with the last two slides. After that we will take your questions at the conclusion of his remarks. Scott Hill : Thanks, Jeff. Please turn to Slide 13, where you will see a transaction summary. As disclosed in our press release on Monday, we agreed to buy Interactive Data Corporation for $5.2 billion. We will finance the $3.65 billion cash component with debt and will provide ICE shares worth $1.55 billion. In addition to the significant strategic benefits of the acquisition, which Jeff just described, we expect to realize $150 million in expense synergies. These synergies will come from the integration of corporate functions and from business efficiencies associated with reductions in technology expenses, business rationalizations and the elimination of redundant operations in the combined companies. The expected cost synergies reflect just over 25% of Interactive Data's total expenses and we expect that within the first year after closing we will realize 25% of those synergies and as we mentioned in our release on Monday, this transaction will be more than 5% accretive in 2016. We have provided a detailed schedule in the appendix of our presentation that takes you through the accretion math. Interactive Data is a business with strong and improving profitability as well as robust cash flows, which will contribute meaningfully to our results. It is also a business that we believe will grow faster when combined with our ICE Data businesses and which offers the opportunity for margin expansion that will generate strong profit and cash growth. Acquiring good businesses with unique competitive advantages that we can improve upon is an important part of the strategy that has enabled us to deliver consistently strong growth year after year. Slide 14 shows that trend. The acquisition of Interactive Data Corp. combined with the diverse business we already operate will enable us to continue this track record of growing EPS every full year since being a public company. I will now hand the call to the operator who will conduct the question-and-answer session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alex Kramm at UBS. Alex Kramm : Hi, good morning, everyone. So obviously jumping right into this IDC transaction, maybe just starting with the outlook that you guys have for IDC, I think a lot of people noted that the growth rate has been a little bit lower over there, I think 3% to 4% or so. But you know having spent some time with the company recently, it sounds like they really were [invert focused] recently and [for last year's] and now are really in a position to grow. So wondering, what you see or what you model as the organic growth rate in that business over the next two years before kind of like ICE adds their secret sauce to it? Jeffrey Sprecher : Sure. I think Alex we will have more to say over time once we actually own the business. But I think most people on the call that know the fixed income space know that there's a lot of changes going on in that market right now. The markets are becoming more transparent. The market participants are demanding more transparency. There's more movement on to some kind of transparent hybrid systems right now and those systems increasingly and the market participants who use those systems are increasingly going to want real-time valuations done, so that people can have some confidence in the price levels that are displayed. And so IDC has been moving on its own from providing end of day data to the ability to use technology to give more robust and more real-time interaction with their customers. They have huge -- for many years they have had a technology project underway to do this. They are coming into fruition of that. We are a technology company providing other kinds of valuation services. We think when we combine all of that we are going to have a really good, robust offering that will be highly valued by the marketplace and will continue to help serve the evolution of fixed income and other hard to value swaps and derivatives that are going to become more transparent. Alex Kramm : All right, fair enough. And then maybe I will just go on the cost side here for a minute. I guess this is for Scott. Can you talk a little bit more about where those synergies are coming from? I think on the pricing side their margins are actually above 60% already. So is it going to be more on the trading solutions side, is it going to be more of moving your existing business on to their new technology? And then also, do you think you are going to shed some of these assets on the trading solutions side? I don't -- I think sums it well but there might be some others that are not really that core to what you're trying to build here. Scott Hill : You pretty much answered the question, with your question. I think really Alex its across the board just that we are not going to go into a ton of detail. Now we will do that as we get closer to the close on the acquisition. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks I think there are opportunities in a number of places. There is $100 million of corporate spend at Interactive Data. There clearly are overlaps from a corporate standpoint with what we got at ICE. You saw our ability to execute on that type of integration and in the NYX deal and frankly every deal we've done before that. There are definitely overlaps if you look at the trading solutions business. They have got a business [indiscernible] which is very similar to the Safety Network business that we have got at NYSE. They have got a desktop business which is similar to the desktop assets that we acquired with SuperDerivatives and frankly our Web ICE platform. So there are I think efficiencies we can get by combining those businesses. Definitely I think there is opportunity around the technology standards as we combine the two companies. So I think the playbook looks a lot like the NYX deal did in terms of where the synergy opportunities exist. There is also -- it's a pretty big real estate footprint. That's another area where we think there should be opportunity. I think we have done a pretty good job of consolidating locations over time. It's better for kind of our one team view as a company. It's also a means of generating efficiency. So look it's a very well-run company that where the profitability has continued to improve, but I definitely think there are multiple pockets of opportunity for synergies which gives us the confidence that we will be able to remove around 25% of the target's operating expenses. Alex Kramm : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from Alex Blostein at Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Hi, good morning everybody. Just following up on I guess on the data discussion. I was hoping you guys could focus a little bit on ICE's current data business clearly still pretty good growth there. So maybe spend a minute on Scott, that the components of the growth that you highlighted early in the call between new users, products, SuperDerivatives and Benchmark Administration. How much of that contributed maybe on a quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year basis kind of an organic -- in an organic state? Just trying to get a sense of the you know what does the growth in that business could look like before we incorporate IDC? Thanks. Scott Hill : Sure. I would be happy to talk a little bit about that. We really haven't gone into a breakdown of the data revenues per se. Obviously as we integrate Interactive Data, one of the conversations we will have is, how to give you some more insights into that. But I think if you look at the year-over-year growth, a large portion of it in the third quarter is similar to what we've seen in the first and second quarters. We continue to see new users that want to consume the data that we are selling across our exchanges, whether it's the New York Stock Exchange or our commodity exchanges. There is significant and growing demand. We saw a big boost early in the year and frankly even from that higher customer count we saw it increase again in the second quarter and again in the third quarter. I've mentioned each quarter to you guys at ICE that I would expect the revenues next quarter to be similar. I have been wrong each time and that's because we continue to see growth in the customer demand. Clearly the SuperDerivatives revenue through the first three quarters was a net add, because we acquired the business. I would argue there as I have before that that beyond the acquisition of the revenue that is contributing to the growth we are still in the process of integrating that business and I think the real growth opportunity at SuperDerivatives is as we look into 2016. ICE Benchmark Administration had a very good quarter in the third quarter and continued really a trend where the first quarter was better than the fourth quarter, the second quarter was better than the first quarter and we had a very good quarter in the third quarter as well. So I would -- again the largest part of the growth drivers continues to be the growth in end-users consuming our exchange data, our proprietary data, but there's no question that SuperDerivatives and then in particular ICE Benchmark are also contributing to revenues. It not only is growing year-over-year but it has grown quarter after quarter after quarter. Alex Blostein : Thanks. And then Jeff, slightly different direction of questions I guess. But over the course of the quarter, MiFID II came out with -- some of the final rules came out I guess there are still some details to be ironed out, but just curious to get your perspective on things like open access and position limits. How is that coming in relative to your expectations? Jeffrey Sprecher : It's a good question. So -- some -- for those that haven't followed it specifically, some more detailed rules were published by the staff as to how this is going to work. But then above that, Commissioner Lord Hill who is the financial services commissioner in the EU has said let's take apart here and take a look at how the totality of all of this new regulation is going to work and make sure that some of these issues on access, position limits, the segregation of research from execution and these kinds of things. Let's take a look at how they're going to impact liquidity and the competitiveness of Europe. So there's a back channel story going on right now with a review of the rules that were just sort of promulgated. Those rules still have to be voted on and so the commissioner's theoretically in the EU -- the voters in the EU will ultimately have to decide whether or not these rules are going to leave the fragmentation, whether they are going to leave the increased systemic risk and whether or not they are going to make Europe less competitive as a result of some of the studies that are going on. So it's very hard to know specifically what the outcome is going to be. As a result of that we compare for a lot of different eventualities and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, one of the things that happens if there is fragmentation, is the value of data and market participants trying to reassemble the market for their own view goes way up. And that's partly been the strategic thinking around here, is to continue to build out our data services space as we may see a value shift away from execution towards reassemble and fragmentation. Alex Blostein : Okay. Thanks for your perspective. Operator : The next question is from Rich Repetto at Sandler O'Neill. Rich Repetto : Good morning, Jeff, good morning, Scott. And I guess this is of a sort of follow-on for some of the other questions. But you know you laid out as we were expecting you would do, but compelling strategic rationale for IDC and market data. But I guess, getting back to the growth questions, when you look at the accretion at least -- we know you took out the buyback when you couple the 5.7. But was it even a concern to you to balance the growth of this -- of IDC versus sort of positioning [indiscernible] overall as a growth company or is it just that compelling or you are just that confident that you will get the growth? I am just trying to get I guess bigger a little bit further into what you were thinking and what are the concern of yours? Scott Hill : Look I think Rich as we look at this business we absolutely believe there is an opportunity to grow it and for it to contribute to our overall growth profile. And frankly that's true at the top and the bottom line. Jeff talked about the opportunities of the combined businesses. There are a number of new products that that are in very early stages at Interactive Data that we are excited about. Clearly the $150 million of synergies is an opportunity I know that's not growth on the bottom line, but it grows the amount of profit and the amount of cash that we generate for our investors and as you know that's where our focus has always been. It's finding ways to generate more growth and more cash flows and I'm supremely confident that this business gives us that opportunity. I don't in any way see this as detracting from our overall growth profile. I frankly think it contributes to it. So we are very confident as we look at the company strategically, in terms of what it can do for us from a growth standpoint. Look I think -- I understand that the interest in looking at one year's worth of accretion, but we don't look at the valuation model, we look at the business over the longer term and I believe you will find over time that this business is absolutely another example of where we put return on invested capital at the top of the list when we evaluate the deals we do. Rich Repetto : Okay. So I'm taking that answer that the growth was just as compelling as the strategic rationale for this. Scott Hill : Embedded out exactly that way. Rich Repetto : Okay. So my follow-up question. I got to do this to you Scott, so on market data -- as long as you talk about market data, the existing market data at ICE, you did some accounting restatements but it's still look like -- it looks like you moved about $13 million from other revenue into the market data even when you exclude the -- and this is a positive. But even when you exclude that, if you took $13 million off of market data, you are still growing $5 million quarter-to-quarter. And again just trying to get at the baseline of where we are at because you had sort of talked about being flat, number of about $10 [bet] you won last quarter. Scott Hill : I do, I think I already fell on my sword earlier in one of my answers, but I will fall on it again. Look in the third quarter we did have a large customer true-up that occurred in the data business. Otherwise it would have been up only a little bit from where we were in the second quarter and I would been closer to right. But frankly I'd be -- I'm $4 million happier that I was wrong. So I do think that as you look to the fourth quarter, $206 million plus or minus in that line on the new basis is probably about where we will be. I'm just going to go ahead and say I could be wrong on that plus or minus $1 million or $2 million. But that's what I think the expectation is as you look into the fourth quarter. And again Rich, I mentioned on an earlier answer, the thing that I'm really pleased with, is we continue to see more customers consumer the data. And I will tell you that's the thing I keep missing in my remarks to you, is that, there continues to be growth and interest in the data business that we have got. And I think that feeds right back to your first question and Jeff's remark about why we are excited about Interactive Data. There is no question that the trend in the marketplace is that customers need more information. They need such people to help them take all the data that exists in the world and turn it into information they can use and that feeds right into the strategy and it's absolutely why I think that Interactive Data will contribute to and improve our growth profile and not detract from it. Rich Repetto : Understood and congrats on the acquisition, guys. Scott Hill : Thanks, Rich. Operator : The next question is from Dan Fannon at Jefferies. Dan Fannon : Good morning. Can you help us think about pricing power within IDC's business and how we should think about -- or essentially how you are thinking about that going forward in terms of raising prices for their existing offerings? And if you can also indicate when the last time they actually passed it on to their customers? Jeffrey Sprecher : I think the short answer is we don't know, because we don't own the business and we are not talking to their customers. But generally the philosophy at ICE is not just to use -- is not to use \"pricing power.\" Our philosophy here is to increase the value add of whatever we provide and then couple that with an appropriate price increase. And think that attitude really would bode well for IDC because we do see a lot of new product opportunities that are already in progress there that are coming through the pipeline that will benefit from and our customers are going to have an opportunity for much more enriched view of the fixed-income markets with those products. I do note that there is a 98% revenue renewal with them. So obviously they are well-liked and well-respected at their current price levels or you wouldn't see that amazing continuation. But look for us to continue to be innovative with them and we think we will have an opportunity to do that. Dan Fannon : Great. I guess just following on your existing market data business and pricing is it, is there any expectations for next year to see a general increase within certain of those services that we should be thinking about in terms of growth or incremental growth there? Scott Hill : Yes. We will -- as we get onto the fourth quarter earnings call we will start to talk to you more about what we expect for 2016 in the core business. But suffice it to say that we continue to look for ways to add incremental value to our data packages and to the customers of our data services and as we have historically, as Jeff just alluded to we don't look to raise prices just to raise prices. We look to make sure our prices reflect the value that we are delivering and we will continue to evaluate that as we move not just into 2016 but in each subsequent year. Dan Fannon : Great. Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Chris Harris : Thanks, guys. We think about the exchanges industry, historically your peers have kind of grown data between 3% to 5% going back to a number of years. I think you guys internally have a much faster rate of growth forecast built in . And so Jeff, I know you highlighted a number of secular changes happening that should be really supportive of the data growth. But just wondering, if there's anything specific or unique about ICE's data mix that would drive faster growth than many peers in the industry? Jeffrey Sprecher : Well I mean I think for ICE as a company that was a start up, what we have continued to see is a richer and richer data set. We started with data that was almost irrelevant and today are becoming quite an important data provider. And as we have gone through that transition and added more and more and more data and more services around data, what you have seen is cross-selling opportunities, the ability to build out a sales force that penetrates markets. And that's why Scott said, we continue to find new customers. I mean we are not thought of I suspect by most people as one of the historical data analytics spenders. There are some well-known, well-entrenched competitors in that space. So what we have been able to do is try to innovate, create some niche products, some things that are interested, very highly targeted to our customers because we run in commodity trading and clearing operations. We are having constant dialog with our customers on what their strategies on and how they are managing risk and we just continue to evolve our product set. So it's a better, faster, cheaper kind of strategy. But on top of that is the secular trend that I'm mentioning which is just regulatory pressures, fragmentation pressures and better and more interested ability by managers to have real-time information that's just growing I think the business for everybody. Chris Harris : Got it. Makes sense. And really quick follow-up for Scott. Can you update us on where we are on NYSE synergies? How much more needs to come out there? Scott Hill : Yes. So we continue to make good progress towards our overall objectives from the NYSE synergies. I think we have mentioned that as we exited this year we would be something like 90% done on those and we are well on track to that. And I think we clearly with some additional corporate functions that that will integrate next year, some real estate that we consolidated towards the end of this year and then as projects [indiscernible] moves on throughout 2015, I think that will push us towards the final synergies that we had committed originally. Chris Harris : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Ken Hill of Barclays. Ken Hill : Hi, good morning, everyone. I guess when I look at the data business, you guys are moving to with this acquisition here as well more of the hard to price products, some of the analytical stuff supported by the raw data, but it still looks like a good portion of your business today relates to some of that trading data from your futures exchange from your cash equities exchange versus sources like Safety, SuperDerivatives or IBA. So as you think about the outlook for maybe that core kind of raw data business there, as that becomes I guess a little bit more commoditized, how should we think about the competitive environment maybe the growth prospects there? Scott Hill : Yes. As I mentioned I think the markets are going to continue to fragment. I think just -- all this new regulation that is going is really vulcanizing markets and the incumbent exchanges like ICE, we continue to challenge all the other exchanges around the world by listing their products and looking for niches. And so we -- there's just this trend that is going on right now that I think you are going to see markets fragment. So even raw data that comes from exchanges have to be consumed by people that are trying to resemble these markets. And so for a while, while we go through this transition I think even raw data is valuable. But what we are investing in and what we are building is really valuation services. If you look at what Interactive Data does, it really is a -- using technology to come up with valuations. If you look at what SuperDerivatives does, it's using technology to come up with valuations. If you look at our ETF calculator business, if you look at ICE Benchmark Administration, all of those are technological ways of trying to drive prices, related prices and couple that with this massive clearing system that I mentioned where we are also trying to take portfolios of positions and drive their actual risk. That's the value-added business and that's the business to grow. It does need the raw data as inputs, but the real value add and the things that people want to pay for is the technological piece and what we've built is a financial services technology company here that's been quite good at marshaling data around and understanding how these products all relate to one another. And I think that's the secret sauce where we are going to continue to invest. Ken Hill : Okay. I know you guys a couple of times have mentioned new users as nice tailwind for the data business. What's really driving the uptick in new users? Is that something that you are ever doing with the sales force or are you really targeting specific groups or is that just having a product that no one else has and how can we think about the new user growth as you start to layer in a whole new large customer base here? And I guess do you need to invest more I guess in the sales force to get better integrated with some of these risk management groups or index groups over time? Scott Hill : It\u2019s a combination of both. We do have a lot of proprietary products, things that we have created around here that are not unlike IDC, where we are getting data out of cash markets and markets that don't trade on exchanges. And coupling those with the more commoditized data and selling it as a package, which is part of what we have been able to do. In terms of the sales force we now have Interactive Data Corporation there is going to be an amazing sales force footprint that comes with that company that will be able to blend together with our sales force and really I think be able to touch a lot of customers. I mean, we mentioned in the prepared remarks that IDC's customer base is literally every significant asset manager, every significant bank and fund around the world. So in that group are people that we don't touch and some of them won't have any particular interest in some of the things we do, but some will because of just their breadth and size and scale of some of these companies that I think are going to want to see a lot of things. The other trend that is going on is that the passive investment trend is just people creating more and more unique portfolios that need real-time valuation and that business for us, is it's partly what leads to our 95% listings market share of ETFs in the United States and how we have been able to approach that business. And we're going to get better and better and better at that with the addition of Interactive Data's valuation skills. Ken Hill : Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : The next question is from Ken Worthington at JPMorgan. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning. First maybe for Scott, balance sheet and leverage. With so much recurring revenue now, why is 1.5 times leverage the right number and what are your thoughts about pushing the balance sheet more given the revenue mix with IDC? And then in terms of deleveraging I think in the prepared remarks you talked about doing it over two years and it seems like in my model I could get you to delever much more quickly. So maybe is there a lot of CapEx that you expect with this deal or would you continue to be buying back stock as you delever? What's the thought there? Scott Hill : So I think our target remains to operate around 1.5 times. That is the expectation that the ratings agencies have for a company that's a single-A, which is what we believe is appropriate for the company. In terms of why, that's their view, I agree with you it is a much stronger recurring revenue base, but that is the view the ratings agencies take and we think that rating is important to us as the operator of the largest clearing operations in the world. So we are going to continue to target getting back to around that number. In terms of the time it takes to deleverage, I think we have conservatively said that it would take two years. I think the point is that while we will continue to pay our dividends, our cash flows will go to deleveraging. You'll likely recall from the NYX deal that we were able to deleverage faster than we had originally anticipated. I am hopeful that that will be the case here as well. But as we sit here today, as I look at the models that we put together I think that the two-year deleveraging path is a reasonable expectation with a continuation in dividend and not doing share repurchases. Ken Worthington : Okay. Great. And then Jeff, the deal is being pitched as a way to accelerate IDC's growth but does it work the other way around as well? Does IDC help ICE's core business? And some of my thoughts but they could all be bogus, but like does it help move business on screen? Does it help risk management or margining on the clearing side? Does it drive volumes maybe to greater level? So how does IDC help ICE's business? Jeffrey Sprecher : You nailed it. That's exactly how we are thinking about it. The operation of clearinghouses you know used to be a back-office function that was not thought about. Today it is a real business and in fact it is a business that's been mandated by regulation and is going to become more and more regulated and the opportunity to grow it is going to be, because we become more and more sophisticated. And valuation is what we do. That's what a clearing platform is. And so when we decided to try to help the large financial institutions get the credit default swaps off their balance sheets after the Lehman collapse, we had to develop all new models and we had the higher large staffs of quantitative analysts that could figure out how to value a product that had been mis-valued prior to that. And we really have developed the skills set there and we just saw that opportunity is like -- the light bulb went on and said, we should just continue to build out those valuation systems and we should be the best in the world because that would be our competitive advantage over the long haul for clearing. Increasingly because of capital constraints on banks and others the market's going to want to have sophisticated valuation of their collaterals and wider and broader types of collateral that can be accepted and that's only going to be allowed by regulators if they have confidence in the people that are operating these things, if that collateral can be stress-tested and properly valued. So it's all -- it's a holistic view of where the market is changing. As I mentioned we started the company by creating an electronic matching engine. Today we have competitors that will actually pay market participants to use their matching engine. I mean so the matching engine itself, which was the thing that was so valuable that started this company at the height of the dotcom boom, today others are not only giving it away for free but will pay people to use it. So there has been a transition of where the market is perceiving the value of these marketplaces and it's really in the risk management capabilities and that's where we have been investing since 2007. Ken Worthington : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Good morning, folks. Maybe just ask a question for Scott, switch to the cost side, the $25 million in cost is going to $150 million by the end of year three. Can you just touch on the run rate of that, if that's a linear growth rate into $150 million or if there are other step functions in that? And if you can also refresh us on what you think the NYSE cost save run rate will be in 4Q this year and then just refresh us on the incremental cost saves for 2017 from NYSE? Scott Hill : Yes. So just with regards to the Interactive Data center deal the $150 million, we noted that we expected that we would be able to realize roughly 25% of those synergies in the first year post close, so effectively 2016. My expectation is from there you'll see it's likely about 65% done give or take a little bit as we move through '17 and then move the large majority completed in '18 with some and subsequently delivered in '19. So that's kind of how I am thinking about the run rate right now. Clearly as Jeff alluded to and I have mentioned a couple of times we've got work to do once we are able and then close the deal to refine some of those assumptions and obviously we will be back to talk to you about it. With regards to the NYSE synergies, as I've mentioned, we are two years' post close of that deal now. We have bought businesses. We have invested in businesses. Trying to show you where inside our synergies you see an exact number, I think it is difficult to do. What I'd point you to is the quarter that despite a significant adjustment in our bonus accrual was nearly 60% margins, margins that were right on track to where we said they would be two years ago. And then I would prefer right back to the remarks I made earlier which is, we are exactly on pace to where we thought we would be at this point and we have got the [actions] that are necessary to help us complete those synergies as we move through 2016. And again where you are going to see that is going to be in our margins. It will not be easily seen embedded in what is a highly evolved and different expense base than existed two years ago. Brian Bedell : Okay. Great. And then a question for Jeff. Just to [stare] this big picture on the data business as you put everything together and clearly the revenue synergies from IDC seem compelling longer term. As you think about when you have IDC in the run rate fully and SuperDerivatives is fully integrated, how do you view the longer term growth in the data business for ICE inclusive of the synergies over time? And then if you also want to weigh in -- later in the potential pricing model for the ICE Benchmark Administration which sounds like it still has a good sort of hockey stick upside to it? Jeffrey Sprecher : Yes. It's hard to know. I just -- my -- I view my job as really trying to identify the trends and behaviors in the industry and get our boat oriented towards those wins and get the [sale] put out there. And as you can see right now and we can see it in our own data that that in our own customer usage data and the conversations anecdotally we are having with customers as this change is going on in the market. I know just -- I just re-up my cell phone plan and I bought more data. So an individual somehow I'm consuming more data and the tools for me to do that get better and better and I have got them on a phone I keep in my pocket. So that's is a microcosm of what\u2019s going on a bigger scale in the risk management business and we have got the sail in the wind here and I think it's going to have legs, because I really do think underneath it in addition to regulatory pressures which are not going to go way, fragmentation pressures which I don't think are going to go away, even though end-users don\u2019t love that. But the powers of vulcanization are pretty big right now. I think this trend is going to last for a while. Brian Bedell : And then just on the Benchmark Administration business in terms of the pricing model where are you in that stage of evolution? Is there a lot more to come down the road? Jeffrey Sprecher : Well it's an immature company. We just announced another new product that we're going to start here in October, but when we stepped back and looked at our portfolio I mean what's amazing is ICE as a owner of key benchmarks now with LIBOR, with Brent crude oil and gasoil with many of our major natural gas indices, with the dollar index. We have on our own, acquired and owned a very interesting portfolio of indices and the move towards passive investing is coming also into the commodity and derivatives space. It\u2019s following what you see in the equity space and those key assets become more and more valuable and people are -- there is more interest in them. And so we are at a very immature stage. Operator : The next question is from Chris Allen at Evercore. Chris Allen : Morning, guys. Jeff you have kind of harped on the fragmentation thesis moving forward and for IDC they are continuous about [indiscernible] fixed-income, the real-time data products seems very compelling. Just wanted to figure out if you have given any thoughts in terms of what the market opportunity there is in terms of revenue and whether that can be leveraged into trading platforms for some of the cash bond markets that are out there and which markets if any you think are primed to take the step towards electronic trading? Jeffrey Sprecher : Well we will have more to say on that over time as we own the business and are able to talk to people with market participants, but clearly there is a trend that's going on for more transparency around the fixed-income markets. And as people are increasingly concerned about what is liquidity available in those market there is going to be more and more pressure to be able to see that liquidity and have it displayed in some manner. So in record data is already pretty active in that area supporting others, third party platforms and some of the new generation of entrepreneurs that are trying to solve that problem. We have a number of initiatives going on that are actually doing well in the fixed-income space that are derivative of our credit default swap business that we may be able to help super charge. So, I am cautiously optimistic that nut will get cracked. It would be nice if it was us, but if it's not we are going to certainly support other entrepreneurs because this real-time data is incredibly valuable and helpful to somebody trying to solve that problem. Chris Allen : Got it. And then just a quick one, on the financing for the deal, the debt being raised at 2.75%. if I recall I think you have about $2 billion you can tap for commercial paper and then I am assuming that will be tapped in the rest of the raise in the public markets, is that correct when we think about it? Jeffrey Sprecher : I don\u2019t think we will likely exhaust all of the CP capacity and I think the bond markets right now are attractive for a company that there is an investment -- a solid investment-grade company like ours and I think it's likely that you'll see us work to take advantage of that attractive market in terms of our ability to fix some of that debt structure over time. Chris Allen : Thanks guys. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Sprecher for any closing remarks. Jeffrey Sprecher : Thank you Amy. Thanks all for joining us this morning. We are excited about we are doing and we will continue to refine our analysis and comments and be prepared on our next quarter call to give you further insight into our strategy and how it's going to evolve for shareholders. So thank you very much. Have a great day. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kelly Loeffler, please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Kelly Loeffler : Good morning. ICE's fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements which we undertake no obligation to update represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements please refer to our 2015 Form 10-K. In our earnings supplement we refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including adjusted income, operating margin, expenses, EPS, EBITDA and tax rate. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP term in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful, as well as how management uses these measures. When used on this call net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses, adjusted net income refers to adjusted net income from continuing operations, and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted continuing operations earnings per share. With us on the call are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Chuck Vice, President and Chief Operating Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Scott. Scott Hill : Thank you, Kelly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on slide 4, which highlights another record year in 2015. Our 10th consecutive year of record revenues and record adjusted earnings. During the year we delivered strong volumes growth in global commodities business, double-digit revenue growth in data and listing, synergy realization ahead of pace, margin expansion, outstanding earnings growth and strong returns on invested capital. And we delivered these results, while investing in our diverse global businesses, making strategic acquisitions of Interactive Data Corp and Trayport and generating over $1.3 billion in operating cash flows, which enabled us to return nearly $1 billion to shareholders. Consolidated net revenues grew 8% in 2015 versus the prior year. Transaction revenues were flat versus 2014, despite solid growth in our commodities and cash equities market. We grew our data services and listings revenue 26% and 10% respectively. This solid revenue growth, coupled with expense discipline enabled adjusted operating margins to expand 4 points over the prior year to 59%. All of this allowed us to deliver $12.15 in adjusted earnings per share, a 26% increase versus 2014. Now let's turn to slide 5, where I'll discuss our fourth quarter performance. Revenues of $875 million, included $50 million from Interactive Data Corp and Trayport, which we closed mid December. Our revenue growth in the fourth quarter was once again driven by strong growth in data and listing. Commodity futures and U.S. cash equities revenues also grew well in the quarter. Adjusted operating expenses were $364 million, including $33 million from Interactive Data Corp and Trayport. Adjusted operating margins were 58%. Our expense discipline and top line revenue growth helped us deliver a record $3.27 in adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter, a 26% year-to-year increase. Please move to slide 6, where you can see further delineation of the diverse revenue stream that contributed to our record fourth quarter. While transaction in clearing revenues were flat year-to-year, both commodities and US cash equities grew 3%. Its also worth noting that while total financial revenue declined in the fourth quarter due to lower equity option in CDS revenue, revenue in our interstate futures complex was up 5% versus last year. Data revenues increased 35% in the quarter, including the addition of Interactive Data Corp and Trayport. Excluding the $50 million in revenue they contributed, our data revenues would still have risen 9%. Finally, listings revenues set another record and was up 8%. Slide 7, shows revenue mix on the left side of the slide and on the right our fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses. We provided a pro forma version of this chart, which includes Interactive Data Corp and Trayport for the full fourth quarter on slide 18 in the appendix. As shown on the left side of slide 7, transaction revenues made up 59% of our fourth quarter revenues and data services comprised 29%. On a pro forma basis though, you'll see that data services would have made up 43% of revenues and transaction revenues only 48%. Going forward, we expect data revenues of $470 million to $480 million in the first quarter of 2016 with additional sequential growth as we move through 2016. I also want to mention that we intend to enhance our financial reporting starting in the first quarter of 2016 when we expect to report two business segments, trading and risk management segment, which includes our transaction based execution in clearing businesses and a data and listing segment, which includes our subscription based revenues. We'll provide more details to ensure that you have good transparency as we make that transition during the first quarter. Shifting to the right side of the slide, you see that fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $364 million, including $33 million related to Interactive Data Corp and Trayport. Excluding those expenses, our adjusted operating expenses would have decline 2% year-to-year due to real estate consolidation and further integration of our corporate functions. This strong expense management once again reflects an acceleration of the realization of synergies and provides a solid foundation to deliver the remaining synergies related to the combination of ICE, NYSE, Interactive Data Corp and our other recent acquisitions. For 2016, we expect operating expenses between $2 billion and $2.03 billion. This includes another $75 million in synergies, which is roughly one third of the total expense reduction we intend to deliver over the next three years. The expense guidance also include approximately $45 million largely related to compensation increases and roughly $30 million for investments in new product development by the new ICE US Treasury Index series, as well as technology upgrade and enhancements to our cyber security platform. The rest of our 2016 guidance could be found on slide 19 in the appendix. We have also included an update regarding our synergy realization on slide 20 in the appendix, where you'll see that we ended 2015 with $480 million in realized synergies. Let's move forward now to slide 8, where I'll review our solid cash generation and capital return for the year. We generated $1.3 billion of operating cash during 2015, which enabled us to invest in growth, fund acquisitions, and return $1 billion to our shareholders through dividends and buyback. Importantly, the cash generative nature of our diverse global business gives us the confidence that we can invest in our business and delever to maintain our strong credit rating, while still delivering on our objective to grow our dividend as we grow. Along those lines, this morning we announced a 13% increase to our quarterly dividend, following the 15% increase we implemented in last years second quarter. This increase ultimately means that we will pay out 20% more to shareholders in 2016 than we did in 2015 in the form of dividend. I'll conclude my remarks on slide 9, with a review of our capital structure and return on invested capital. At December 31, we had $627 million in unrestricted cash, including the debt related to acquisition of Interactive Data Corp, our total debt was $7.3 billion at the end of 2015 and our adjusted debt to EBITDA was 2.8 times. As noted above, we are confident that we can quickly reduce our leverage. On the right side of the slide, you see our return on invested capital, which was nearly 8.5% in 2015 and remains above our key competitors and above our cost of capital. Our ROIC has steadily improved since closing the NYSE acquisition in 2013 and was on track to approach 10% as we move through 2016. As you would expect thought, ROIC will dip as we incorporate our investment Interactive Data and Trayport. Importantly though, we expect to continue to generate ROIC above our cost of capital and to re-establish the upper trend into 2017 and beyond. Our fourth quarter and 2015 results are a testament to the focus and execution across our business. We delivered record revenue, strong operating margin expansion and once again double-digit earnings growth, while continuing to strategically diversify our business to serve our customers growing demand for information and risk management. And importantly, we are off to a strong start in our transaction base business in January and expect our data and listings businesses to generate solid growth once again in 2016. This solid revenue base, coupled with vigilant expense management should once again enable us to deliver double-digit earnings growth in 2016. I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey Sprecher : Thank you, Scott. And good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report that 2015 was the best year in our company's history. It was our 10th anniversary as a public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange and it was our 10th consecutive year of delivering record revenues and record earnings. I'll take a few minutes to update you on our growth drivers, before we move into our question-and-answer session. Starting on slide 10, which illustrates our unparallel track record of growth over the last decade. Starting as an over the counter energy trading platform, then evolving to futures exchanges and clearing houses, we've now expanded into being a leader in data, connectivity and listings. We've evolved our business model to stay close to our customers changing needs and in that process, we've moved from a 90% transaction based revenue model to a balance mix of transaction and subscription based revenues across a diverse range of markets and services. Because our team and its culture is central to our strong results, I want to take a moment to highlight the promotions that we announced last week. Ben Jackson, who previously led ICE Futures U.S. for us is now our Chief Commercial Officer, where he is leading the integration of our acquisitions to ensure that we meet our targets of ever increasing results. Ben is deeply steeped in the ICE culture and will help export that important operating philosophy to our new colleagues. Lynn Martin, our Global Head of Data, has expanded her scope to include responsibility for uniting Interactive Data Corporation with the ICE and NYSE data operations. Lynn joined us through the NYSE acquisition where she led Liffe U.S. She is already working closely with the team at Interactive Data to ensure that we benefit from our combined strengths. And Trabue Bland, who was ICE's Vice President of Regulation, is now the President of ICE Futures US. Trabue has a strong legal and compliance background and has experience in working with our customers to address regulatory and market issues. These promotions set us up for the next phase of growth by leveraging the deep expertise that we have across our global team. Turning to slide 11, you'll find a summary of our diverse growth drivers across a broad range of markets. Many are secular trend and others are organic growth initiatives, but all are the results of our customers changing needs. I'll walk through these in the next few slides, starting with the solid performance of our financial markets in 2015. In our European interest markets, we saw a significant build in open interest during the year, rising open interest, was a coupled with a 30% increase in daily volume in the fourth quarter and that has continued into 2016, as daily volume in our rates markets grew 27%. The increased activities in interest rate trading is been driven by customers returning to the market in Europe, as central banks are becoming more vocal, and action oriented. While the US, UK and European central banks maybe on different path, the changing expectations create dynamic rates and currency environments that drive trading and clearing activity. Also in our financial markets, credit default swap clearing contributed over $100 million of revenue in 2015. This business continues to open new opportunities for us across its vast clearing landscape, as further mandates across credit and interest rate swaps come into effect later this year. Slide 12, is a snapshot of the strength of our energy markets. The importance of risk management at all energy price levels is evidence, as you can see, well into the second year of oil price declines. The depth and breadth of our markets, along with uncertainty around oil prices and geopolitical events drove record oil revenues, which increased 14% in 2015. And this resulted in the ICE Brent contract achieving its 19th consecutive annual volume record. A strong performance continued into January with daily volume in our oil markets up over 20% for the month, including another record month for ICE Brent crude volumes. We maintain a close dialogue with our customers in the energy markets, amid shifting dynamics of supply and demand and the challenges of declining prices. Expectation for the level of oil prices, the strength of the dollar, central bank action and global economic trends continue to drive uncertainty and the increasing volumes in our commodities markets reflect these conditions. We also continue to grow by introducing new products in new markets, such as ICE Futures Singapore and ICE Clear Singapore, which were successfully launched in mid November. Now turning to our global data business on slide 13, you can see the breadth of services that we now provide. Similar to the development of our diverse exchange and clearing operations, the development of our data services business offers a meaningful opportunity to leverage our global network. Our data services provide transparency, information, analysis and connectivity, all of which is consumed by market participants to transact across market and instruments. Our customers rely on data, trading and risk management platforms which are often interdependent across their workflow and when these services are well coordinated they create a strong value proposition. While interactive data, SuperDerivatives, ICE and NYSE data are each strong businesses in their own right, we believe they will be much more valuable to our customers and to our shareholders on a combined basis. Our customer\u2019s needs are not limited to exchange traded data. The broader market for fixed income is vast and Interactive Data Corporation is centered on the changes taking place in this over the counter market. You'll recall that the drivers of our acquisition are based on newer secular trends, these include the standardization of products for electronic trading and clearing and the need to trade with algorithms and quantitatively driven program. The increased use of technology is creating demand for data input, including the connectivity that consume this information and the increased requirements for independent valuation required by financial reform raise the demand for autonomous data. Finally, the trend towards growing indexation and passive investment, as seen in our strong ETF market performance, supports the access to data that can be licensed and packaged. We believe that data and data connectivity are deeply linked to the global markets that they serve. And in order to lead in customer service and innovation we are making investments in these areas. Towards that end on slide 14, I want provide an update on our early progress with Interactive Data. In January we begin integrating the corporate services function, so that we can move forward, serving our customers as one team and as a result we become even more confident about our combination. A great example of our potential together is last week\u2019s announcement of the launch of the ICE US Treasury Index Family, with BlackRock agreeing to transition four of its flagship fixed income iShares ETFs to reference these indices. The new ICE fixed income indices rely on pricing input from Interactive Data. Also yesterday, we announced that AllianceBernstein chose our Best Execution service to evaluate its fixed income trade execution quality, a service that utilizes the new Interactive Data real time pricing algorithm. We see further strategic opportunities with both active and passive fund managers, by leveraging the strong relationships that we have gained with them at the New York Stock Exchange. And we look forward to continuing to update our investors and our team as this integration progresses. I'll move now to slide 15. 2015 was another exciting year for NYSE listing, culminating in record quarterly revenue. We were pleased to welcome great companies like First Data, Square, and Ferrari during the fourth quarter. NYSE again led in global proceeds raise for the fifth consecutive year. Later this month, we expect to begin rolling out the new NYSE Pillar trading platform for our NYSE Arca markets. This is just one example of our commitment to incorporating leading technology into our unique market offerings. I'll also note the strong performance of NYSE Arca where exchange traded product volume rose 25% in 2015. As the leader in ETF listings we've undertaken a study to support the long-term growth of the market for our issuers, by identifying improvements to the trading ecosystem. Last week, we released the study conducted with McKinsey, outlining a number of proposed market enhancements, many of which are already underway. Our listed customers continue to tell us that they prioritize proper price discovery in their shares over speed, as is offered by our designated market maker model, whether through industry coordination or by our own action, New York Stock Exchange will continue to lead positive change for listed companies and their investors. Turning to slide 16, you can see that we're a growth company. In 2015 we grew our top line and our bottom line and we're growing our dividend as we grow our earnings. ICE is driven by change which brings opportunities to better serve our customers and I'd like to pause and thanks to those customers for their business in 2015. And I look forward to building on our track record with our newly expanded teams in this New Year. I'll now turn the call back to today's operator Rocco, and he will be happy to moderate your questions. Operator : Thank you very much, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Mike Carrier : Thanks, guys. Maybe first question here for Jeff. Since the IDC acquisition and the announcement and based on some of your commentary, the BlackRock win, the AllianceBernstein, just wanted to get your sense, I know it's still early. But when you think about the growth opportunity in that part of the business, given some of the early traction that you're seeing with the customer base and it's a pretty broad customer base. Just wanted to get your outlook on what that revenue growth potential is. And I think that the IDC growth rate was around 3% in terms of what they were growing, and so maybe the opportunity from that base? Jeffrey Sprecher : Sure. Good morning. IDC tends to typically sign longer term agreements that have some kind of escalator in them and has a very, very high renewal rate, well above 90% on \u2013 by any measure of renewal. And so that part of revenue is really almost an annuity type business. What we are working on and have the team working on now is really expanding the scope of services and expanding the footprint in customer base and we feel pretty confident that we are going to significantly increase the revenue growth and earnings potential of that company, by new products, new services, new geographies and what have you. And the reason I wanted to highlight in my prepared remarks, there are two new services that we just put out and we literally put Lynn Martin in there, little more than 30 days ago, that demonstrate the kind of thing that we think we can do. They have very, very strong synergies with the New York Stock Exchange. The deep relationships that we've gotten over the last couple of years around the NYSE. We've taken our ETF management business and we're combining it with Interactive Data business. These are businesses that produce real time pricing and equities and now in fixed income for end users, for the management of exchange traded products, and the like. And in addition, we mentioned that for non-exchange traded products we now have real time valuation services that are new and robust. And so we feel relatively confident with the thesis on which we made the acquisition and I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're actually more confident now that we started to put our teams together and unlock our customer relationships. Mike Carrier : Okay, thanks. And Scott, just a quick one on the expense guidance. Just the two items that you mentioned, like the 45 on comp and then the 30 on product and tech investments, just maybe where are those areas focused? And then when we think about the backdrop right now, the revenue outlook looks pretty good. If things do start to slow, where are the levers and areas of flexibility versus the long-term investments? Scott Hill : Yes, thanks for the question. So the $45 million is kind of what I'll refer to as business as usual investment in our people, investment in the places where we work, et cetera. It\u2019s a little bit more than 2% of our overall expense base, which \u2013 that\u2019s to be expected plus or minus a point in any given year. These are investments in people, but if you look back over the last three years, we've spent about $90 million delivering almost $300 million in incremental revenue, which is about 70%, just under 70% incremental margin. So we think those are good investments. We think they've proven to be good investments and they're good investments going forward. The $30 million is really more targeted, it targeted a lot of things that Jeff talked about in his script, not the least of which was the recent announcement with Interactive Data Corp on the index that we did with BlackRock. There are also investments in there to further enhance our cyber security capabilities. We have always been a technology company. We have always been very focused on information, security and stability of our systems. We design our own system. We manage our own data centers. And so that\u2019s an areas where we think the additional investment pay offs in the long-term by continuing to provide systems that are up for our customers to do the trading and the risk management that they need to do. So that\u2019s how I would generally characterize it. And I think you're exactly right, those investments are being made against the backdrop of a very diverse set of commodity and future and option products, all of which have some open interest spaces and an expectation that our data and listings businesses will continue to grow. Mike Carrier : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Hi. Good morning, folks. Jeffrey Sprecher : Good morning. Scott Hill : Good morning. Brian Bedell : Jeff, maybe just to elaborate a little more on IDC. I know this is definitely a hot topic. But if you can talk about to what extent you think you can package your data offerings using IDC altogether and sell that to the large customer base, whether that's part of the revenue opportunity? And then also, if there's any interest in eventually creating some type of fixed-income trading infrastructure - fixed-income platform I should say? Jeffrey Sprecher : Sure. Well, we've already seen synergies in combining Interactive Data with some of our other businesses, beyond the indices and execution quality, product offerings that I mentioned. Our SuperDerivatives valuation business, which is really designed to value very difficult and complicated contracts is quickly finding synergies with Interactive Data in the customer base where we can package really valuation services together. I think another part of data is how you deliver it, and one of the \u2013 the one real piece of infrastructure that we kept when we unwound the NYSE technology business, was the safety network, which is just what its acronym implies, a very safe network for which, as Scott mentioned we're increasingly putting more cyber security and protections around and the ability to deliver through that network into our data centers. And so we believe that in addition to the product that the delivery mechanism will be a value to our customers as well. So all of that, for the 30 or so days that we've really been focused on it, it feels pretty good and we've seen some early wins in that regard. I think, I've made comments before in public forums that the trend in our industry is for more execution competition, some of that is happening is because regulators are vulcanizing markets by warning more local regulation, particularly a local regulation of banking sector. And for many years our industry went electronic and took for granted the fact that we could trade globally, well, now there are speed bumps around the world, as they are reporting requirements and other kinds of things that are fracturing the market. Beyond that there is actually a trend in Europe that Europe is trying to specifically potentially fracture markets with MiFID II. And as those markets fracture, the need for putting the information back together on behalf of market participants and having it delivered in a safe manner that\u2019s reliable and timely and what have you, is really where the puck is going to go and that\u2019s where we're skating. And we've amazingly seen some very, very early signs of success just in a few short number of days. Brian Bedell : That's great color. And then maybe just on the NYSE pillar, the timing of the rollout in first quarter and then whether that's - there's any change in pricing strategy as a result of that? And then also maybe, Jeff, if you want to comment on to what extent you think more volume will move on exchange from dark pools in light of what's been going on with some of the settlements? Jeffrey Sprecher : Yes, so pillar the platform is up and is being used in industry \u2013 coordinated industry test to get people ready if you will. We expect that it will begin rolling out in the next few weeks. And as I mentioned in prepared remarks, we're going to start with the Arca platform. The early results of that \u2013 that is very, very predictable, reliable and fast platform that is simple and easy to understand. Our experience in the derivatives markets have suggested that that is a winning formulae for people that honestly just have predictability of how our markets are going to operate and then can make their investments and build their own systems and tools around that predictable nature. We're not going to change any pricing. I mean, that market is a highly competitive market and prices continue to be adjusted by competitors and peers and others and we'll respond to that. But we feel pretty good at rolling out pillar just - we think its going to be a dramatic improvement for the same value proposition. We have seen business in 2015, in our mind, leave the dark pool market and come back to listed trading and NYSE is gotten - it\u2019s above its fair share of that \u2013 of that market movement and if you look at the market share trends, they are very, very positive for NYSE and that\u2019s with our own legacy platform. So we feel pretty good moving into '16. It will take a while to put everything on pillar. We're going to be relatively slow and deliver it, as we found out this summer when the New York Stock Exchange had an outage, it\u2019s a major market disruption for the markets. And so we have a heightened sense of caution if you will that we recognize the high place that we hold in the ecosystem. And so we're going to be deliberate, but the systems looks good and is ready to go. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : And our next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Blostein : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Jeffrey Sprecher : Morning, Alex. Alex Blostein : You touched on a couple of new initiatives with both iShares and AllianceBernstein. I wanted to pick up on that discussion a little bit. Two-part question, sounds like these opportunities came about pretty quickly into the integration process. So when you look out, are there a lot more of similar opportunities like that, particularly around the analytics piece, the index 1, I think is a little bit more self-explanatory. But on the execution analytics not part of it, so that's part A. And then part B, can you talk a little bit how the pricing structure works, length of the contract, is it a UN base or is a fee base, just help us better understand what opportunities that could be? Thanks. Jeffrey Sprecher : Sure. In my mind a lot of the opportunity set that we're seeing really comes from the fact that, that the buy side was able to rely on certain services that came from the global banking industry, that were relatively casual and informal, but today due to regulatory reform and internal audit practices, it need to be more rigorous. So for example, it might have been perfectly acceptable a few years ago to call a bank counter party and as, what they think, what you think the mark should be on a particular instrument and rely on that. Today, the regulators and the auditors wanted independent validation, increasingly as people are taking the obligation to get best execution seriously as the SEC is paying more attention to best ex-requirements in the fixed income space. Asset managers and others are making investments to make sure that they are compliant and they are able to represent for the end users that they are using best practices. So it\u2019s a relatively new market as you probably know. The fixed income space is evolving. Some of these things that I mentioned are really just tip of the iceberg. In other words, they haven't really resulted in formal rule makings or obligations, but people see them coming and are getting ahead of them. So we think its very early days and a big market. We have always had some execution capabilities in the fixed income space because of our Creditex acquisition, a lot of people that do credit default swaps, due underlying bond transaction. So we have a very good dialogue with a lot of end users, people that are in the markets everyday and we're exploiting all of those channels right now and Lynn Martin and her team are working to organize that up. So that we can speak with one voice. In terms of how we charge for them, its pretty early days right now. We're having a lot conversations as you probably know the passive index managers are very, very price competitive with another, particularly for relatively standardized pools of trading. And so they are looking for how they can best manage the services that go into supporting that. We're pretty familiar with that. We've been talking them around NYSE Arca and their listing activities for years. And so we want to be \u2013 we want to put a compelling package together for them that is value added for our shareholders. So we're having lot of conversation about how to do that, how to partner with these guys to give them a better offering, but still return great returns for our shareholders. So early days yet, but we'll probably have more to say about it and Scott will have to figure out a way to talk to you about that, so that you have some predictability and metrics as we go forward. Alex Blostein : Got it. And then staying on the pricing subject for a second, now that you guys have been with IDC for two months or so, any observations around pricing practices and the legacy install book of business and any enhancements that you guys could envision doing to that part of the business? Jeffrey Sprecher : They're basic bread and butter service is a highly valued service that, the top 50 asset managers are all using and are deeply embedded in the work flow. Our thought really is to bring our culture into it, which is okay, how do we innovate off of that and provide more products and services and higher value to those end users, because what we've always seen data is that if we provide more value then people happy to pay more for it. We have never really, and I think you know that about us, we don\u2019t go in and just jack up prices per se, what our philosophy is, let's give people a better package and then they will be happy to pay for it. And so in that regard we don\u2019t get a lot of push back on our pricing and yet we've been able to really raise the profitability of these businesses. The AllianceBernstein product that I mentioned in the prepared remarks is based off as a real time bond pricing platform, which is new, its something that Interactive Data had under construction at the time we acquired it. We're working to accelerate that and to get more and more instruments and more sophistication around that. And we think there a number of channels where that can be deployed. Right now, obviously the AllianceBernstein deal is a deployment that results in financial gain for us. But that data is floating around the ecosystem right now in a relatively uncoordinated way and people are starting to rely on it. We're going to figure out how to better channel that and monetize it for our shareholders. Alex Blostein : Understood. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Rich Repetto : Yes. Good morning, Jeff, good morning, Scott. Jeffrey Sprecher : Good morning. Scott Hill : Good morning. Rich Repetto : I guess, my question, and this occurred a little bit prior back in the middle of December. But Bloomberg was able to acquire Barclays aggregate index. And I know - I think everybody knows that Bloomberg's capabilities with analytical and tools and now getting that index. So I guess, you face competition head on, do see Bloomberg as a competitor in the future? And was it a fair, even process, because I think Bloomberg does - was it a fair process in trying to acquire the index from Barclays? Jeffrey Sprecher : Well, let me first say that Barclays is client of Interactive Data and a lot of the data that is used in those indices emanates from Interactive Data. So we don\u2019t necessarily view that as competitive, it\u2019s actually a customer for us that is long standing. And while those indices are valuable, obviously they traded for a significant value, the data in many of those indices belongs to Interactive Data and the history if you will also belongs to the Interactive Data. So we believe customers who are benchmarking to indices that it\u2019s going to be important that they have some continuity in their marketing materials and to the way they talk their investor and their board. And so at this moment in time we have no reason to believe that those indices aren\u2019t going to continue to be anything other than a customer to us. There is a lot of index activity in the fixed income space. It\u2019s an unbelievably large space in terms of number of instruments and issuance and the global nature of the debt markets around the world. So the various fund managers are providing lots of different instruments to allow investors to participate in those markets and as a result there are a lot of different benchmarks and indices and ways that the market is growing. And so as you can see we were able to convince one of the most sophisticated providers of ETF in the form of BlackRock to begin to move business on indices that we now provide. Rich Repetto : Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And my follow-up would be just on the broad topic of divestitures. And I know at IDC, there was the trading platforms that weren't necessarily, they may be core overall to the business, but weren't to the pricing reference data segment, they weren't. But you signal BondDesk, and I think there was something about a platform did custom websites. So I know you're quick to move, or at least you were with the NYSE and divesting things that weren't core and you didn't see as value to yourself. So I guess, the question is what's the likelihood of seeing divestitures in 2016? And then the ancillary would be, we're also coming up on the two year, I think, evaluation period on a bigger topic but the NYSE? Jeffrey Sprecher : Yes. So Ben Jackson' who is now reporting directly to me and really we've passed with the job of looking at our total portfolio, looking at out footprint, and helping us to figure out how to best organize that. And that work is just starting. So we don\u2019t have anything to say right now. I will say that, there a lot of interesting parts and pieces in the businesses that you just described that we want to take a hard look at it to see where they might fit with other things we do before we make any kind of decisions on their long-term deployment and that\u2019s what Ben is doing with us. I think you know, what's been interesting about NYSE is that, that it fits so nicely now with Interactive Data. As we mentioned the systems that we need to run ETFs inside in the NYSE are highly complimentary with Interactive Data. The sale of data, the way we move marshall [ph] data around, having the New York Stock Exchange data is a door opener for our sales force. Its - obviously we can easily help people price equities, having our commodity data in this era where there is tremendous conversation at all levels of board rooms about commodities. All of that package together is really valuable. So the New York Stock Exchange, while it may have a different name and other than it\u2019s not called ICE. The reality is that company is being integrated in a way that is really raising our earnings capabilities across the firm. And not the least of which is that New York Stock Exchange is a cash generative business that sits in the United States, so that we get US cash which is allowing us to quickly pay down debt and delever and we'll allow us to return capital to shareholders faster. We are in an \u2013 we are global company with an enviable position and that we're not struggling to figure out how to move money around the world in order to return capital to shareholders. And so it\u2019s paid some very, very strong and interesting dividends that I think is really working for the firm right now. And not\u2026 Rich Repetto : Okay\u2026 Jeffrey Sprecher : By the way, its convenient for people to write about the New York Stock Exchange, and not you Rich, but for people to right about the New York Stock Exchange just say, once at 85% market share, and now it only have 25% market share, woe is me. The reality is that last year was the highest earnings of the New York Stock Exchange in it\u2019s over 225 year history and this month I suspect that this is probably one of the highest earnings months in its history. It\u2019s a company that is doing incredibly from a financial standpoint and I think as we continue to shed legacy platforms and simply it and make it better and easier to understand and more approachable to investors and listed companies, that its going to continue to do well. Notwithstanding the fact that it is in a highly competitive environment, with very strong competitors. But it\u2019s doing very well and is not a business that we would want to see leave our portfolio. Rich Repetto : Understood. Thank you for the detail, Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Hill of Barclays. Please go ahead. Ken Hill : Hi. Good morning, guys. Jeffrey Sprecher : Morning. Ken Hill : So I just want to get back on IDC again. So from an asset management perspective, you guys are in a pretty unique possession. You're providing the index, the listing, the trading, even some of the trading data. So that, I'm assuming, provides you a lot of leverage in multiple areas. So it sounds like the licensing side is probably the more competitive pressure point. When you're having the conversations with firms like asset managers, are they actually structured from a sales perspective where they can talk holistically about the business, thinking across those things? So do packages really resonate with them, where you could maybe use listings as a loss leader to help on the index side or on the trading side over time or is that going to be something that probably take time for them to get up to speed on? Jeffrey Sprecher : No, one of things that we come to see is as I mentioned earlier, is that \u2013 is the major sponsors of these new instruments are doing incredibly well. These products are growing in popularity with investors like you can't believe. But it\u2019s a very competitive space and there are \u2013 the way for those managers to do well, with growing AUM, is to make sure that they manage their cost. And so that sentiment is at the highest level of those firms. And so I can go in or other senior people at ICE are meeting with the people at the highest levels of those asset managers and having holistic conversations about how we could work better together to overall help them meet their regulatory obligations, do a better job for their investing public and manage their costs in a way that\u2019s predictable that keeps them competitive with another. So my point is I think that is such a strong value proposition for us and such and interesting thing for those managers that the conversations are happening at levels above your typical sales person. It\u2019s easy once that door is open for us to figure out creative ways of packaging things and we've just started this. But so far it\u2019s been very, very well received and actually had some inbound calls from people saying, can you come in here and let's sit down and talk about how we might work better together. And we're lucky that the New York Stock Exchange and the people around Arca have done a very good job of managing the listings of those companies, so they built track record of knowledge that we can lever off of. Ken Hill : Great. I think we've heard a lot about the IDC on the call today. I don't think I've heard the word Trayport yet. Is there anything you guys are looking forward to there, or things we can look forward to from a revenue perspective or a growth perspective that's interesting for 2016 there? Jeffrey Sprecher : I would just say that, you know, you could see that our company is evolving, that we're providing services to others that go beyond just trading and clearing. And so we're following the workflow of the industry and providing infrastructure. But it\u2019s a new \u2013 it\u2019s a natural evolution for us, many of our competitors have provided software in the form of their trading platforms or access to their networks. We had historically not been in that business. But as you see, we're moving in that direction because we have an interesting footprint. And so in that regard we want to support brokers, we want to support asset managers, investor listed companies and others with services that go way beyond just trading and clearing. Ken Hill : Okay, great. Thanks for taking the question. Operator : Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt of KBW. Please go ahead. Kyle Voigt : Hi, good morning. Jeffrey Sprecher : Good morning. Kyle Voigt : I just wanted to clarify real quick on the call synergies. Scott I think you said $75 million this year is one-third of what you expect to achieve over the next three years. So am I right to infer there's another $25 million of NYSE-related cost synergies left to realize in 2017? And then on Trayport, I know it's small, but are there expense synergies from Trayport that's embedded into that guidance? Scott Hill : Yes, it\u2019s a good question and what I did was deliberate. Now in the NYSEs we own Interactive Data Corp, we own Trayport, we own True Office, we own SuperDerivatives. We made a number of acquisitions in the last three years. And so what we effectively said is, exiting 2015 we had about $70 million to go with NYSE, a $150 million as we integrate ICE and Interactive Data together. So 220 and going. And that\u2019s how I think you ought to think about it. We've got $220 million that we need to get out largely over the course of '16, '17 and '18 and we're going to get a third of that done this year. And that\u2019s how I think you ought to think about the expenses moving forward, because the reality is, we look for an expense wherever it is. Jeff talked about, the Interactive Data assets that we're looking at. There is overlap with similar assets and SuperDerivatives, inside ICE, inside the NYSE and as an investor I don\u2019t think you care where the dollar is saved, you just care that the dollar gets saved. And that\u2019s how we're going to be thinking about it and talking about it as we move forward. 220 to go as we entered '16, a third of it done this year. Kyle Voigt : All right, perfect. Thank you. And then just a follow-up question. Turning to regulation, just around MiFID II, really around the possibility of some of these large commodity trading firms, including many of your customers, potentially getting caught under the scope of MiFID II and being forced to hold more capital. So it just seems like we're in this weird period of limbo, where we're waiting to see how long MiFID II will delay. I just wanted to get your thoughts on the delay, whether you think the delay gives your customers more time to speak with regulars, and if you generally feel more confident that the delay could lead to a bit more practical and workable regulation? Jeffrey Sprecher : Well, the short answer is, is exactly what you said, yes. One of the things that we've seen now is that when MiFID II was passed, I got the sense that politicians went and asked their constituents would you like to have everything unbundled, would you like to be able to choose where you trade and where you clear and where you buy research and have complete choice in what you do and everybody said yes. Would you like to make sure that the banks are not cornering markets and taking speculative positions that drive prices the wrong way, and people said yes. And what \u2013 the question that wasn\u2019t asked is, how was that actually going to impact the market and what is it going to cost and now that the regulation is out there people are looking at it and saying oh my gosh, its going to fragment markets, its going to drive up my costs, its going to potentially make it more difficult for me to hedge, it may move markets to other jurisdictions. And so there is a much more active dialogue going on around MiFID II and not just the areas that I described, but the totality of the bill. And I would say to you that Lord Hill, who is finance minister there, the infrastructure minister that\u2019s overseeing financial services, is got a open ear and wants to \u2013 my impression is that he wants make these markets work and it is much more impact full in the dialogue when the ultimate end users go in and talk about their concerns then it is when exchanges in brokers and infrastructure providers go in, because we look to the politicians like we're just trying to protect our interest but in reality they are starting to hear these kind of issues from the end users. And so obviously it has slow down and part of the reason that it is slow down is that there is an active dialogue going on around it, as to improve the language and make it work. And so in that regard relatively hopeful and respectful that the bill will get better with time. Its hard to know when it will actually be implemented, some of these things require investments and not just investment by the industry, but also investment by government in order to monitor and maintain some of these things. So until Europe has landed on a specific set of language that people can understand and then figure out the time table on how it can be implemented, it\u2019s hard to know exactly what the timing is. But the good news is that there is an active dialogue and its pretty broad and involving lots of different constituencies. Kyle Voigt : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Bond with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Andrew Bond : Thank you. Good morning. Jeff, I'm interested to get your take on the IEX application and just ICE's objection to IEX as a registered stock exchange. The application has clearly struck a chord, given the overall response throughout the comment period. However, out of all the comment letters, there's really only a handful that have come out against IEX, whether it was from competitors and large market-making firms that put it out. So I guess, the question is what are the majority of people missing from a fairness perspective? Is it just a rule base as defined by Reg NMS, or do think ranking IEX registered exchange status will damage market structure? And additionally, could you please give your thoughts on IEX's assertion that NYSE already operates with a speed bump of its own? Thanks. Jeffrey Sprecher : Sure. Let me start with the second question first, which is we do not and that\u2019s absolutely false and it\u2019s wrong. NYSE does not have any kind of speed bump, any kind of artificial delays. I just want to correct one thing in your question, NYSE and ICE are not against IEX becoming a regulated exchange. And in fact, the National Stock Exchange recently had an application, it became a stock exchange and we were not against that. What our concern is, is that there is a law on the books that requires that NYSE and all other regulated exchanges deliver our results as soon as technically practicable and we've been held to that standard for years. And what IEX is asking is for an exemption that would solely be for IEX, not for the industry, solely IEX would be the only one that would exempted from that law. And IEX is attempting to patent the system that it is seeking exempt. So it is looking for the ability to have a regulated monopoly status that the other exchanges are not \u2013 do not have. And so, I have advocated that and worked behind the scenes with lots of people to say we should take a look at market structure, we should look at slowing down. The ideas that they are promulgating are not bad ideas at all. But the methods that they are going about it were objecting to. This is solely for their benefit and not for the benefit of the industry. And frankly if that were to go forward, IEX would actually hurt the other people in the industry, normally when there is innovation, the innovation helps people, but it doesn\u2019t actually hurt the people that are left behind. And so, that is our objection, that\u2019s what we want the SEC to take a hard look at. If the industry can come together and work on our change to Reg NMS, we would be very supportive. If the SEC wants our support or needs our help in changing Reg NMS to allow things to slow down, to change the way that data moves around, to change the obligation of exchanges, we're all in for that. But not a one off deal that benefits somebody who is trying to patent and receive a regulative monopoly. And I don\u2019t think its fair, I don\u2019t think its \u2013 it is un-American and it\u2019s not fair and not the way that our system should work. Andrew Bond : Okay. Thank you for clarifying. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. BATS just made a big push into ETF's business, which ICE and New York Stock Exchange dominates. They've hired from ICE, BlackRock just moved some listings products to BATS. So how do you think about the encroachment here in what at least we consider to be a very good and important business for you? Jeffrey Sprecher : Sure. Well, first of all I should I mention that it\u2019s a highly competitive space and you mentioned one competitors there are others that are all coming at this, because it\u2019s a growing area of business and in a competitive space people are looking to get their market share. One thing that we've heard from many of the ETFs sponsors is they likely frankly the competition. They feel that it\u2019s benefiting them. And secondly, that they do want to have some diversity of providers, in case there is technical problem or some other structural problems, so that they have tested other systems and would be able to move business around quickly. So some of it is really just \u2013 some of the movements that you're seeing is really people doing a BCP planning, so that \u2013 because these franchises are becoming ever more important. And so you can \u2013 we understand and actually help some people to do that, because we want to be able to have those businesses, those that can move our way. The \u2013 I don\u2019t know what to say other then it is not particularly expensive to list an ETF. You're talking about things in the sense of $25,000 a year or less. So while it is highly competitive, that is really not the metric that is going to allow an ETF provider of any size and scale to determine where to list. And what I am investing in what you can see us doing is really improving the package of services that we can have to literally partner with these firms, to be part of their workflow and to make life easy for them because we understand this business and even more so now in the fixed income space. And we are an advocate for them and want to continue to be an advocate with public policy and with their marketing and sale efforts that goes way beyond where that $25,000 investment would have for and ETF. So we feel good about our positioning, but it\u2019s certainly competitive. Ken Worthington : Okay. Great, thank you. And then just on the health of the crude trading market, obviously volumes have been on fire. But open interest peaked in November, producers are, I think, a pretty meaningful customer base for you, and to at least some extent, they're under some stress or pressure with the decline in oil prices. And we understand that hedging has actually fallen off a bit because the curve is so steep. So how do you think about the health of that business right now and maybe even the outlook? Thanks. Jeffrey Sprecher : Sure. What's interesting is that, that while we read and hear and talk to customers about them being under pricing pressure. The reality is we've seen a growing number of users and interest in these markets. So it hasn\u2019t \u2013 that phenomenon has not led to a decrease in the number of customers, its actually led to more interest and an increase in the number of customers. I think more people are paying attention to those prices and trying to figure out when to lock in low prices or whether or not there are going to be high prices. And so there is a lot of trading activity. Open interest as you know, I am covering this for a long time, I am sure, that open interest in certain commodities, particularly in oil will go up and down with the steepness of the curve and when it evaporates [ph] or goes into contango, there are different carry economics that go on, that affect open interest, but actually accelerate trading, which is what we care about. So we care about our open interest and we monitor it, we watch it, we use it as a predictor. But you have to look at it in context with, is the curve getting flatter or steeper. And so we are very, very comfortable right now that that is still a growing franchise and as I mentioned we had record volumes in January and there is tremendous interest in the energy commodity space globally right now. Ken Worthington : Okay, thanks\u2026 Jeffrey Sprecher : So we would expect that to continue \u2013 we would expect that growth to continue. Ken Worthington : Great. Thank you very much. Super, helpful. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Sprecher for any final remarks. Jeffrey Sprecher : Thank you, Rocco. And thanks all for joining us this today. And we look forward to continuing to update you on our progress as we go forward. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you, sir. Today's conference has now concluded. And we thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may disconnect you lines. And have a wonderful day.",

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please also note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kelly Loeffler. Please go ahead. Kelly Loeffler : Good morning. ICE's first quarter 2016 earnings release and presentation can be found on both the homepage and the Investors section of theice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2015 Form 10-K. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including adjusted income, adjusted operating margin, expenses, EPS, EBITDA, and tax rate. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP term in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful, as well as how management uses these measures. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses, and adjusted earnings refer to adjusted diluted earnings per share. With us on the call this morning are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Chuck Vice, President and Chief Operating Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Scott. Scott A. Hill: Thank you, Kelly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As Kelly mentioned, the slides to which we'll refer this morning can also be found on the ICE homepage. I'll begin on slide four of that presentation where you'll see that we delivered another record quarter, including adjusted earnings per share, which rose 20% as reported versus the first quarter of 2015. As this is the first full quarter including recent acquisitions, unless otherwise noted, year-over-year figures will reflect comparisons against adjusted pro forma first-quarter 2015 results. On that basis, ICE's first-quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share grew 19% to a record $3.68. Both our trading and clearing segment and our data and listing segment contributed meaningfully to first-quarter revenues, which in total, grew 5% to $1.2 billion. This solid revenue performance combined with disciplined expense management allowed us to expand operating margins by five points to 59%. Equally important, these results helped generate strong operating cash flows, which enabled us to pay over $100 million in dividend, up 14% from the fourth quarter, while also allowing us to significantly reduce our leverage, which stood at only 2.5 times just three months post the closing of the Interactive Data transaction. Moving to slide five, you'll see the component of our strong earnings growth. Revenue growth of 5% combined with a 6% decline in adjusted operating expenses generated adjusted operating income growth of 14%. Net income attributable to ICE grew 18%, and we delivered our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth. We achieved these strong results despite a challenging quarter for institutional trading desks, continued regulatory change, and while executing on a range of strategic initiatives. From the integration of previously-acquired companies and continued product and technology innovation to evaluations of additional value-enhancing M&A opportunities. We remain committed to generating strong financial performance in the current period, even as we develop strategies to enhance our returns on investment in the future. Turning now to slide six, I'll walk through our new segment reporting. First quarter consolidated revenues increased 5% year-over-year to nearly $1.2 billion. The chart on the left side of the slide shows our revenues were evenly split between our trading and clearing segment and our data and listing segment. Turning to the table on the right side of the slide, you'll note a similar balance of growth across the diverse line items that constitute each segment. For example, as shown on the table, total trading and clearing segment revenues grew 4% year-to-year, with solid contributions from both commodities and financials, which grew 5% and 4% respectively. Within those balanced results, ICE Brent, sugar, Euribor and U.S. cash equities each grew double digits. Our data and listing segment revenues grew 5% in the first quarter. Our pricing and analytics revenues were up 6% and exchange data revenues were up 9%, both driven primarily by new users and new products. As these results demonstrate we are already seeing the expected acceleration in the growth of the legacy interactive data price reference data business. This strong start further supports our confidence that our data revenues can grow 6% to 7% on a pro forma basis for the full-year 2016. Finally, listings revenues grew 3% over the prior first quarter, despite a quiet IPO environment. The growth in the first quarter and our confidence in our listings business will continue to grow throughout 2016 is due to our clear leadership and capital raising activity at the NYSE over the last few years. And I'm pleased to say that we've already seen a handful of IPOs early in 2Q and our pipeline continues to build. Let's shift to slide seven where I'll cover our disciplined expense management and provide an update on expense guidance and synergies. First quarter adjusted operating expenses declined 6% year-over-year to $476 million and pro forma operating margin expanded by five points. Our first quarter expenses included higher-than-usual M&A related spending, but that was largely offset by some 2015 credits and compensation and professional services. The period also benefited from the release of roughly $11 million of non-income tax related reserves, which was partially offset by a few non-operating expenses below the operating income line. More importantly, even adjusting for these impacts, we would have been below our expense guidance as we once again realized synergies sooner-than-expected. This strong first quarter expense performance and our updated synergy expectations result in us lowering our full-year expense guidance to between $1.97 billion and $2.0 billion. This improved guidance reflects expected 2016 expense synergies of $85 million to $90 million, that's up from prior guidance of $75 million, and this includes $30 million to $35 million from Interactive Data, which has also improved from prior guidance of $25 million. For the second quarter, we expect expenses in the range of $495 million to $505 million. The second quarter will be the first one to reflect the full impact of 2016 compensation increases and we will also see a pickup in investments related to business development and CapEx. I'll conclude my remarks on slide eight with a review of our solid cash generation, improving leverage profile and ongoing capital return. We generated nearly $600 million of operating cash flow during the first quarter, which enabled us to invest in growth even as we reduced our debt by over $500 million and returned over $100 million to our shareholders through dividends. As a result of our strong cash flow generation, we reduced our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA from 2.8 times at the end of 2015 to 2.5 times at the end of the first quarter. We now believe we can reduce our leverage below 2 times by early next year, which we think is sufficient to maintain our current debt rating, while also creating more flexibility for additional capital returns. We also increased our first quarter dividend payout by 14% versus the fourth quarter, consistent with our commitment to grow the dividend as we grow our earnings. Our record first-quarter results show our continued focus and execution across our businesses. We delivered solid revenue growth, strong operating margin expansion, and once again, double-digit earnings growth. And importantly, we see strong demand from our customers and encouraging trends across the markets we serve. I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A, but for now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : Thank you, Scott, and good morning to everyone on the call. The first quarter of 2016 was the best quarter in our company's history for both revenue and earnings. And it was our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth. We delivered 20% earnings per share growth in the quarter, as a result of expanding our revenues and reducing expenses, and while making investments for long-term growth. These strong results demonstrate our consistent focus on increasing our top line, expense discipline, cash flow generation, returns on invested capital, and our capital returns. This morning we announced our decision to end our current review of a potential offer for the London Stock Exchange Group. We thought that the combination may have a compelling rationale, including bringing together the premier transatlantic capital raising venues, offering complementary interest rate and financial products, and providing widespread equity LIBOR and fixed-income indices, together with extensive market data. So, over the last year members of our board and our advisers attempted unsuccessfully to arrange meetings through the LSE Chairman to discuss these ideas. Then, following our public expression in March of interest under the U.K. takeover code, the LSE Chairman and CEO did not engage with ICE. Notwithstanding, we spent the last two months reviewing the data that we were provided with our financial advisors, auditors and legal and regulatory experts to determine whether our operations, expense basis and governance structures would result in a strategic combination that would meet ICE's return on investment thresholds, while offering LSE shareholders a meaningful share price premium. The disappointing level of engagement of the LSE ultimately did not allow us to make a complete determination of the integration benefits and their related risks that ICE would require to support a bid. We are committed to building on our track record of creating shareholder value by achieving the targets that we set at the outset of our strategic transactions. Because we were unable to establish to our satisfaction the financial models, risk undertakings and integration plans needed to set such targets, we're turning our focus to other opportunities to build on our track record of growth. As our results today show, our deliberations did not get in the way of ICE growing its revenues, increasing synergies, reducing expenses, utilizing our strong cash flows to de-lever and increasing our dividend. I'm proud that our team has once again delivered strong operational results and the best quarter in our history, even as we considered strategic opportunities. And I'll now highlight some of the opportunity set that we have starting on slide nine. Our team has driven a range of new initiatives in recent months. From launching our Singapore exchange and clearing house to introducing new equities trading platforms and issuer services at NYSE to expanding our data valuation and network businesses, each of these initiatives is on track, thanks to our global team that drives these efforts. So let's start with data, which is our most recent area of expansion. It's worth noting that 10 years ago, in 2006, 11% of our consolidated revenues were derived from market data. Today, 41% of our revenues are from our data business, where the breadth of our products and services continue to expand. We're already seeing the benefits of enhancing the consistency of our revenues with solid margin and growth profile that subscription revenues bring. We've long seen the trend of more data and connectivity consumption as markets became more automated, regulated and cleared. And we've been an early mover in addressing the rising demand for information and analytics across virtually all asset classes. This is similar to our recognition of clearing becoming a central piece of market infrastructure a decade ago. And I'd like to note that even today the category of exchange data, which is our tradition proprietary data, is still 11% of our significantly expanded total revenue base; and it continues to grow alongside of our highly-complementary trading and clearing businesses. We've previously discussed the secular drivers of rising data demand, including regulatory reform, automation, unbundling, fragmentation and the move towards passive investing and indexation, just to name a few. These secular trends are also driving growth and the other recent additions to our data business, pricing and analytics, desktops and connectivity. Our acquisitions over the last three years including NYSE Euronext, SuperDerivatives, Interactive Data and Trayport bring a unique range of assets to support our growth. Our new services range from real-time bond pricing and indices to global infrastructure for exchange and broker connectivity to widely distributed desktops. We continue to make great progress on the advancement of Interactive Data since its closing in December. Last month we launched the ICE U.S. Treasury indices to leverage the index business that was part of the NYSE with the capabilities we found at Interactive Data, and we're in the process of aligning our global sales and shared services teams to better serve our customers and realize efficiencies. Moving now to slide 10, I'll note that growth in our global markets and clearing houses continues. Just as with data, there are similar secular growth opportunities as the markets continue to evolve. Customers are increasingly adopting hedging practices, as well as more recently, seeking those solutions to do so in the most capital-efficient manner. And hedging is needed regardless of price levels of commodities. Nearly two years ago when oil prices began falling, many suggested that trading and clearing volumes would decline with prices. The reality is just the opposite, because absolute price levels tend not to drive risk management activities, volatility does. In our global oil and agricultural products, we've seen consistent demand for the risk management that our exchanges and clearing houses offer. Our core benchmark contracts continued their growth and innovation. For example, ICE Brent Futures set volume, revenue and open interest records in the quarter, and spawned the launch of a Brent contract to better serve our Asian customers at ICE Futures Singapore. Growth in our agricultural markets were once again led by our world sugar contract, with revenue up 17% over the prior first quarter. Our financial markets ranging from European rates to global index benchmarks to credit markets also continued to strengthen. In our Euribor contract, which is Europe's short-term interest rate benchmark, revenue increased 34% year-to-year on Central Bank actions and the dynamics around the euro, pound and dollar. Volume in our equity index complex across FTSE, MSCI and Russell grew over the prior first quarter, consistent with our cash equities and actuary options markets where volatility continued to drive growth. I'll wrap up our strategic highlights on slide 11 with an update on our achievements at the New York Stock Exchange where we're delivering on the synergies that we promised, as well as driving new revenue growth. Our investment in new systems coupled with simplifying our offerings continues to create a better market structure for market participants. In U.S. cash equities, we had a record quarter with strong volume and market share that continued to grow, coupled with strong revenue capture. We led in ETP listings, with 82% of the new assets under management choosing to list with NYSE this quarter. And we maintained listings for 92% of all U.S. ETP assets under management. We continue to be the premier listing venue due to our liquidity, tight bid/ask spreads, and the amount of time that these securities trade at the national best bid and offer price on our exchange. We're working closely with ETP issuers to help enable their ongoing innovation to grow this investment category. In our NYSE listings business, revenue grew despite the quiet quarter for IPOs. And we have great momentum with an IPO pipeline that began to open up in April. We're expanding issuer services and rolling out our new NYSE Connect platform to our listed companies later this month. These services are an important part of the value proposition that we bring to our listed companies and these are not a revenue line item for us, but part of what drives our leadership in listings. There remains no more trusted model for our issuers, which is why the NYSE is growing with the first quarter representing the best quarter in its 224-year history. I'll close on slide 12 noting our track record of growth, execution and results. This year has already been a productive one, just one quarter in. We reviewed and chose not to pursue the LSE transaction. We grew revenues, reduced expenses and increased synergies. We continued to expand margins and drove double-digit earnings growth. And we invested for growth, repaid debt and returned dividend capital. So I'd like to thank our customers for their business in what was the best quarter in our company's history. And I'd like to thank our team for their continued hard work. My colleagues and I look forward to continuing to update you on our progress throughout the year. And with that, I'll now turn the call back to our operator, Rocco, who'll be glad to turn you on so that we can take your questions. Operator : Thank you very much, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Michael Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Michael Roger Carrier : Thanks, guys. Hey, Jeff, just given the announcement today and looking at kind of the growth initiatives that are in front of you, just wanted to focus on the data and I think the clearing side of the business. It looks like you're seeing some good traction. I think the outlook for that 6% to 7% growth. Just wanted to get an indication you mentioned new users driving some of that, I know you guys are been active on producing new products and services, but any indication of what's driving that? Where you're seeing that increased demand? I know there's a lot of regulatory changes whether it's on the banks and the FCMs or on their clients, in terms of trying to figuring out, how to hedge, how to clear, in this kind of dynamic and changing landscape? So just wanted to get a sense on, where you that playing out, and any kind of incremental granularity that you can provide? Thanks. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : Sure. Let me start and then I'm going to ask Scott to give you a little more detail behind the numbers. But when you step back, one of the changes that I've noticed at ICE is that when we acquired Creditex, Creditex had a platform that was once called T-Zero, today it's called ICE Connect that was connected to hundreds of buy-side participants. And we continue to grow that connectivity since we acquired the firm and used that to link the buy-side to our clearing houses. Then when we acquired SuperDerivatives and ultimately Interactive Data, we acquired sales teams that had even more connection to the buy side. And at the New York Stock Exchange every quarter we have large quarterly meetings with significant buy-side participants that I also attend, as well as many of my colleagues. And so long story short, what has gradually happened in our company is that we've been able to broaden our footprint and our touch-points to ultimate end users, and they are the ones that are really driving the growth of more screens and more consumption of information. Scott A. Hill: And I think we tried in our data and listing segment to break out the revenue lines to give you a perspective along the lines of what Jeff described. If you noticed in the quarter, our desktops and connectivity revenues were up 3% and that's more people wanting to get connected to us and once they're connected to us that allows them to consume the data products that we're selling and the breadth of the offering that we've got continues to grow and then that translates up into what you saw in our pricing business that grew 6% and our exchange data business that grew 9%. I've talked to you over the years and I look at it every single month, what's going on with the number of users around our exchanges and that tends to be driven by what's going on in the oil markets or the commodity markets generally. And that line has continued to trend up, but now by being able to supplement that with the business that we bought at Interactive Data to offer more products through a seamless and secure connection, that combination gives us the confidence that the overall business will grow 6% to 7% for the year, which is an acceleration of what we've seen over the last year or so and also versus what we saw at Interactive Data in their history. Michael Roger Carrier : Okay. That's good. And then, Scott, just on the expense guidance, I get the lower for the year, in terms of the synergy recognition. Just wanted to understand, I think you mentioned just in the 2Q, the pick-up that we're seeing just on a sequential basis. Did you say that's more driven by just the annual comp and some CapEx? And then, I think \u2013 I don't know if there was anything in 1Q that depressed the number, but I just wanted to make sure we were clear on that? Scott A. Hill: Yeah. That's a good question. There's a little bit of noise in the first quarter expense, so I appreciate you asking it. So, it's really driven by two things primarily, first of all, in the first quarter as I mentioned, we had the release of a non-income tax reserve of about $11 million, those happen from time to time. The size or timing is difficult to predict. So that's not something we would expect to repeat in the second quarter. And so that would cause a natural increase in SG&A quarter-to-quarter. And then the second part of it is what you mentioned, the compensation increases really don't kick in for us until March. And so effectively, in 2Q, 3Q and 4Q you get a full quarter versus one month and that would push comp up probably $9 million to $10 million on a quarter-to-quarter basis. And embed in there as well is an R&D tax credit that we had in the first quarter. So overall, those are really the two key drivers that move you up quarter-to-quarter. My expectation is, in the range, we'll probably be in the lower part of that range in the second quarter, and then we'll stay within that range trending slightly higher within it as we move through the rest of the year. Michael Roger Carrier : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : And our next question comes from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Richard H. Repetto: Yeah. Good morning, Jeff; good morning, Scott, and congrats on the... Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : Good morning. Richard H. Repetto: ...congrats on the improved guidance both revenues and expenses. So my first question, Jeff, is when you described the LSE transaction, clearly in the frustration sort of rung out. And it seemed that like that you're pulling out of the bidding, not based on the merits or the fundamentals, but rather the engagement that you've received from the LSE. So I guess, the question is, is there any other legal avenues to pursue, or is there \u2013 what does the UK takeover law provide that if the engagement was there, to allow you to evaluate the transaction like you want to? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : Well, thanks for the question. I think the point I really want to make is that we have a history of doing M&A deals, and we have a very strong history of delivering on whatever we say we're going to do at the outset, and that's an important metric that we have here on how we want to talk to our shareholders, partly why I think we've had permission from our shareholders to do M&A as that we've earned their trust that we will deliver what we say we're going to do and that they can count on it. And so, when we can't get visibility and don't have confidence, it makes it very, very hard for us to look our shareholders in the eye and suggest that we are going to deliver a specific amount of performance. And I don't have anything under the takeover code that's going to change that perception. It takes engagements in order to come to those kinds of determinations. And I'll just leave it at that. Richard H. Repetto: Okay, all right. And I guess my follow-up question, Jeff, would be, again having to do with the UK, but the Competition and Markets Authority they've announced they've launched an in-depth, I guess, what they term an in-depth investigation into the Trayport transaction. Can you talk about that? It's already closed. I know it's unusual circumstances, but what's your position, and does that put the Trayport platform at risk, I guess? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : Sure. First of all, it's actually not unusual circumstances. The way the UK takeover works is that they have a period of time after closing to review a deal. So we fully expected that review, in the way the process works. And frankly, obviously, we're cooperating fully, and we believe that ultimately the CMA is not going to object to us owning Trayport in the way we operate it. Richard H. Repetto: Okay, all right. Thanks for the color. I appreciate it. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from Alex Kramm of UBS. Please go ahead. Alex Kramm : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : Good morning. Alex Kramm : So, just coming back to the LSE discussion for a minute. I think when those discussions first started, I think the initial view investors took was like, oh my God, competition is going to increase substantially when Deutsche and LSE get together. So I'm curious about your view of how you view your competitive position if those two actually end up getting together, which I guess, is not a foregone conclusion. But also in terms of the integration challenges that they might have, kind of like the combining clearing houses, different cultures, so maybe any opportunities that you can capitalize on, while these guys might be a little bit distracted over the next couple of years? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : Sure. Well, first of all, I don't want to comment too much because they're going to go through a competition review that's going to open up a lot of opportunity for the entire market to comment on competition issues. And so I don't want to prejudge any of that. But with respect to their offering, it's been very unclear to us what is being offered. And so I don't know how to react to it. Let me just make one point of color about our company, unrelated to them. I want to be very clear, I'm talking about ICE. ICE operates clearing houses around the world. We operate largely on a common technology platform. We have global customers that we serve, and in many of our clearing houses we have highly similar or highly correlated products. If it was easy to figure out how to net that down, we would be doing it because we have every incentive in the world to offer the best offering that we can for our customer base. The reality is that in different jurisdictions there are different bankruptcy regimes and when we \u2013 just as we saw when MF Global collapsed, the way people were treated in the U.S. as soon as the court stepped in and the administers, and the way people were treated in our clearing houses outside the U.S., was very different, even though the products were similar, the customers were similar and the risks were similar. And so these things complicate the ability to do cross-border integrations. We continue to work on it. We've been actually working on that topic for years. Had lots of dialogue with regulators and customers on how it might be accomplished, but it is a very difficult problem to solve because at the end of the day, people don't want money in flight cross-border at the moment of bankruptcy, and regulators tend to come in and regulate locally during these moments of stress. And that's just a fact that all of us are trying to figure out how to work around. Alex Kramm : Thank you for that limited color you can give, I guess. And then secondly, on the data side, just coming back to ask one question \u2013 actually one quick one for Scott as well. Scott, the 6% to 7% guidance on data, I assume that's organic. That doesn't include whatever you are buying from S&P, which I believe is $100 million annualized revenues, so just clarify that? And then for you, Jeff, on a bigger picture, you mentioned integration of sales teams, and really getting, selling IDC products again. When we talked to management of IDC last year before you owned them, it sounded like they had really been focused inwards, and getting the products right, and not really selling. So just wondering where you are in that process of actually selling again. And just as one anecdote, we talked to one bank the other day, they said they don't even know who their IDC salesperson is. So it seems like some things can still need some fixing, so maybe just tell us where you are in the process? Thanks. Scott A. Hill: So I'll be quick and then I'll hand it over to Jeff. The 6% to 7% is pro forma growth for the businesses we currently own. So it doesn't include any businesses that we will own in the future, and I'd also taken opportunity to repeat what I said on the last earnings call that, that 6% to 7% for the year will also reflect market data revenue that we anticipate will accelerate sequentially as we move through the year as well. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : And on your question, I think you're market intelligence and feedback is spot on, which is at Interactive Data, they have various ranges of products and have various salespeople that specialize in those products, but they did not have an overall comprehensive way of touching customers. If you add that to ICE that has SuperDerivatives, that has people at the NYSE, that has other connectivity, has our ICE Link platform. We have people selling clearing and exchange data solutions. We also have all these various touch points. And so the real effort that's going on now is to bring everyone together, so that we have single points of contact for our large customers, so that they know how to get access to the entire suite of products that we have. And we can see already that that's just in the early stages and we can see already that just the work that we've done alone around IDC has improved our sales function, and has allowed our revenues to grow and we think it's only going to get better. It's a high priority for us because we really do believe that this company grows by having a close relationship to our customers because they end up giving us ideas and ask \u2013 tell us about their problems and give us an opportunity to create solutions that they will ultimately acquire from us. And so it's very, very high priority and it's the work that's going on right now. It's also part of why Scott was able to increase his synergy guidance because we really do believe we will have a much tighter integrated team as we go through this year. Alex Kramm : Very helpful. Thank you. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : Hopefully, year from now when we get back on, you'll have different market color about us. Alex Kramm : That's the idea. Thanks. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Kenneth B. Worthington: Hi, good morning. I appreciate your hesitation on two of the previous questions. I'm going to try again because I think it's important. I'll try to ask the questions a little differently. Maybe how certain do you think it is that Deutsche Boerse and LSE get approval to merge or maybe do see a lot of risk or challenge to this merger? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : I think at the end of the day we have no idea. So, it's an easy answer to give you. It's their challenge to demonstrate why they should be allowed to merge and we'll be a passive audience in appreciating what they do. Kenneth B. Worthington: Okay. And then, it would seem possible that merging a futures business and an OTC clearing platform could appear threatening to your futures business. Is there any way to give us comfort that maybe that merger is not threatening like, these futures businesses are very sticky, we've seen a lot of competition come in before, it hasn't really been able to rip apart our futures business. But again, this seems a little different. Maybe why is this the same thing we've seen over and over again, and not a threat? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : Sure. Well, first of all, I'd note that we've been growing our interest rate futures business in Europe. I think it was 34% year-over-year. So that's a franchise that we continue to invest in and have had great results with. We compete with other people that have already offered the solution that you just described. And so we're already competing against that kind of offering. Just stepping back, if you say how many people in the world are there that have OTC interest rate swaps that are fully or largely offset with futures contracts; in other words, that they've completely hedged out their risk. The people that do that are not end users. The people that do that are dealers, people that are offering something to one party and then immediately hedging it out so that they take out risk. That dealer community is under pressure as you, I'm sure, know. It's been shrinking, if you look at announcements that are going on. And so, it's unclear that the paradigms of the past necessarily are going to be the paradigms of the future. And so we're trying to build out our franchise. We've launched a lot of new products to serve our customers, as we anticipate continual changes in the way that these financial businesses operate, but other than that, we're competing in that world today and we're doing really well. Kenneth B. Worthington: Okay. Great. Very helpful. I appreciate it. Operator : And our next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy: Hey, good morning. A couple of weeks ago the European Securities and Markets Authority talked about how they didn't see a need for a 30-month delay for the implementation of open access rules in Europe. Curious about your updated thoughts on those open access rules and how it would impact ICE? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : Sure. Well, we've been living with \u2013 the whole industry has been living with the prospect of these rules being implemented now for many, many years. So we continue to get our businesses ready to be responsive to those rules. I think the way it impacts the entire market is that there is a goal to create more competition, which to you and I means, more fragmentation of markets. We also think that it will be very, very difficult and hard and very little incentive for any third party to start a major clearing house when the existing clearing houses have open access. So in an odd way, while it's meant to stimulate competition, it at the end of the day, probably entrenches the incumbents, including ICE who has a large clearing presence in Europe. So we continue to build out our capabilities inside that clearing house, to get ready for access. And we've continued to make sure that the ancillary services that we provide around the trading venues, where we do believe there will be fragmentation, offer a lot of capabilities to our end users. So you've seen us take on the ability to create more indices, improve our data offerings, improve the kind of consultative compliance services that we offer to our customers, we've worked hard on improving our delivery mechanisms for physical products and all those kinds of things, which will all largely become unbundled as the market fragments and create opportunities for us. Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy: Yes, that's helpful. Thank you. And then my follow-up, can you just kind of talk about the competitive dynamics right now in energy futures trading? Obviously, you have the established competitor, you have a new start up there. So what are the dynamics that you are seeing in terms of market share and order routing, particularly in the key products Brent, WTI, and natural gas? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : Sure. Well, we have best quarter in our history, so yes there is competition. But clearly, in terms of our ability to deliver financial results we're doing very, very well. We sit with record open interest in Brent as I mentioned. And so we have very high prospects for that franchise going forward. There are always going to be entrants to this business, as I think I've mentioned in other kinds of businesses, people have this figured out ways of expanding the market, that expansion, while it benefits them, also has side benefits, oftentimes that benefit us. And I think you're seeing that in the numbers. As fragmented markets in my mind are bad for end users, they are very good for intermediaries. They create much more arbitrage capability that brings a new kind of arbitrageur to the market that wants the leg in all of the various different venues, which drives volume. And so, ICE really doesn't care about market share. We really want to have people that want to value our services and pay us to provide them. And so that's the market that we focus on, which is a subset of what you're talking about, and we're doing really, really well in the market for people that want to pay for services and that's why we continue to grow. Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy: Great, thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Chris M. Harris: Thanks, guys. Questions on the synergies, as you guys get through 2016 and we start looking at 2017, can you remind us maybe how much more synergies are left to come out at that point and maybe qualitatively where they'll come out? Scott A. Hill: Yeah. What we said on the last call was that by the end of 2018 that we would be largely through the remaining $220 million of synergies that we had to go. That was the $150 million of IDC in the $70 million of NYSE. I'll note again what I said then, which is, what is IDC and what is ICE and what is NYSE, it continues to blur. So, we're really focused on delivering on that $220 million expense reduction, again largely accomplished by the end of 2018. We had mentioned last call $75 million of that would come out this year, we increased that now to $85 million to $90 million, and so our expectation to raise there. We announced that Ben Jackson has taken over as the Chief Commercial Officer and he and the teams have been in with IDC 24/7 over the last two or three months, once we closed the deal, and continue to make progress in identifying the specific actions to deliver the synergies this year. And they're working on building the 2017 execution plan as well. So, as we move through this year, as we get better visibility, we'll talk to about that. What I would simply conclude is, of the $220 million, by the end of 2018 we're going to get $85 million to $90 million this year and we're very confident that we will deliver on that objective over time. Chris M. Harris: Okay. Very good. And then just a quick follow-up on the expenses for this year. Just wanted to confirm that in the guidance you guys haven't deferred or delayed any investment spending that you previously were guiding too? Scott A. Hill: We have not. We continue to make those investments, and it's one of the reasons why we're confident in our ability to grow our data business 6% to 7% this year, because as we reduce expenses through synergies, it in no way impedes our ability to invest in future growth. Chris M. Harris: Got you. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Vincent Hung of Autonomous. Please go ahead. Vincent Hung : Hi. The question on the capital structure, what is the right capital structure now for the business given it's 50% recurring revenues? And shouldn't the target leverage ratio be higher than 1.5 times, in that context? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : That's a really good question, and we've been involved in extensive dialogues with the ratings agencies over the past few months on exactly your point, which is, the business model that ICE had and the financial structure and capital structure that ICE had when we did the NYSE deal back in 2013 versus where we sit today in 2016 is very different. Pre-NYSE, 80% to 90% of our revenues were volume based. Post-NYSE, it was still 70% to 75%. We are now at a point where our annuity like businesses are about half our revenues, which introduces significant stability into the financial model. You saw the very strong cash flows in the first quarter. While you can't multiply that times four because it's got our annual listings billing in it, we clearly are on track to a number that's going to be around $2 billion of operating cash flows for the year, which you'll note is significantly above where we were the prior year. Our CapEx needs have grown slightly, and so even netting that out, our free cash flows are very significant. You saw in the quarter alone, we were able to knock three tenth of a point of leverage out in the first quarter. And so I think all of that summed up is why I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're now comfortable once we get below 2 times leverage, which we think we can do late this year or certainly early next year, we believe that will support our overall rating. And that rating is important to us, and so we're going to do the things that are necessary to support it. But as you mentioned, I don't think 1.5 times is that bogey anymore given what we've done. I think we could comfortably operate about 1.75 times, 1.80 times and again below 2 times I think we're back active looking at ways to return additional capital to our shareholders and we're looking forward to doing that. Vincent Hung : Okay and just the last question. Can you give us more clarity on the IBA and monetization of the LIBOR, (46:39)? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : Yes, I mean, I'll update you in the financial sense in that on a year-over-year basis that business contributed well in the quarter. We had seen good growth as we moved through the back half of last year, and the first quarter results were solid as well. It is still largely around the LIBOR business, but as we continue to build out ICE swap and the gold fix and other of those products, we would expect the contributions from the business to continue to improve as we move through this year. Vincent Hung : Thanks. Operator : And our next question is from Kyle Voigt of KBW. Please go ahead. Kyle Voigt : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Jeff, I just wanted to follow up on earlier question regarding the UK takeover code. So, in order for you to be able to make a bid for LSE within the next six months, you outlined four circumstances in the press release. But the release also says that you'll be able to bid with consent of the UK Panel on Takeovers and Mergers. So under what circumstance could the panel consent to this? If the LSE approached you, and was more open to share information at that point, do you believe the panel would be open to you making a bid? Or is this out of the question now that you've made this announcement today? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : Well, I wanted to first of all point out to you that the form and substance of the way we put that release out was really a relatively standardized form and the four points that you've outlined are really available to all participants generally in any UK takeover situation. So you shouldn't read anything into the fact that we mentioned those four in terms of trying to get in our heads on contemplating where we go from here. Those are all available to us and to anyone else in our position in other deals and we'll just have to see how life progresses, but don't read anything beyond the written words there into our actions. Kyle Voigt : Okay. And then just a follow-up, on the two acquisitions that you announced from S&P, can you just talk about those acquisitions, how they fit in? And then can you confirm whether you will be paying for those in cash now that you've taken yourself out of the bidding for LSE? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : Yes, so each of those \u2013 the acquisition of the business from S&P that you noted is, I think we discussed earlier, it's right now going through an anticipated competition review. We suspect it will work its way through this year, and remain confident that we get to closing around that timing. As we get closer to the end of the year, and the close of that deal, we'll be back to you to say a little bit more about what its contributions will be to our financial statements and how ultimately we'll fund it. You will likely have noted when we announced the deal that we noted that we had the flexibility to pay in either cash or stock at the time of the closing, obviously which we choose will depend on when the closing happens and what else happens between now and then. Kyle Voigt : Okay. Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Just to go back on the market data business in terms of the 6% to 7% growth rate guidance. Either Jeff or Scott, can you talk a little bit about sort of the more granular dynamics of that in terms of revenue synergies with the IDC products across the ICE platform, like how much is included in that assumption, and is that something that's much more of a 2017 event? And also, I'm sorry, also Trayport as well? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : Sure. Well, first of all, there are tremendous synergies across the range of businesses that we've acquired recently, and that's really what our plans call for us doing is unlocking those synergies \u2013 the revenue synergy opportunities across them. But just by way of example, we launched these new treasury indices at IDC, but we were able to develop those using a very strong team that we have at the NYSE that has very intimate relationships with large ETP and ETF providers. So we are able to very quickly have a dialogue with a unique customer base over their new product sets, their ideas and how they're going to grow that market and what capabilities we may have to support them that neither company as a standalone had on their own, and it was amazing that we were able to put that together within the first month or so of ownership and it's paying dividends. Obviously, we announced very quickly that BlackRock was moving some large ETP products on to those indices and now our team is out working with a lot of other providers and users of indices to advance and accelerate those products. I would just make the point to that much of this data revenue that we're talking about is subscription based, which gives Scott the ability to have great confidence when he tells you that it's going to grow at 6% to7% this year because many of those contracts are being signed or have already been signed, so we have tremendous visibility into them. Those tend to recur, so that's the nice thing about that model. So looking forward, we would hope that we're doing a good job with those customers that they will continue to re-sign with us. And meanwhile we take the products that we've developed out on the road and find new customers for them so that we can have growth on growth. Scott A. Hill: And just adding slightly to that and touching on the end of your question, the thing that excites me about this is the 6% to 7% this year is really based on the strong performance of the individual parts. All of the effort to come together and to integrate and work together, as Jeff talked about, we'll get some that yield in the year, but it's really that's about what's going to enable us to grow in 2017 and 2018 and beyond. So that's why we've got confidence not just in the near term where the businesses are doing well this year, but in the longer term where we think as the companies come together the opportunities for growth will only expand. Brian Bedell : Great. That's great color. And then maybe just switching gears a little bit to the ETF listings, in terms of some recent competition on offering, basically paying for listings, and using obviously the trading combination to make money on that. How do you feel about that, or how do you see that, or do you \u2013 I guess, do you see that as a threat to the ETF listings franchise longer term for you? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : Well, you know that kind of intense competition has been in the market for a while and you can see the results that we posted, which is we're doing phenomenally well. When you step back and look at payment for order flow, while it became accepted within the intermediary community around the equities market, giving equity kickbacks to large institutions that have very strong brands and are trying to appeal to retail customers in an era where the SEC and the labor department and others are very concerned that retail investors be given good guidance as to how their money is being handled. It's a real reputational brand risk for somebody to step into that quagmire. It would beg the question, did somebody create a product simply to generate churn inside of it and get these equity kickbacks or was that really the best listing venue? What I will tell you is that all of us in financial services are under pressure by new regulation and also just best practices to make sure that we have no single point of failure in our businesses. And the big institutional investment firms are subject to those same kinds of reviews and pressure. So we expect that in that ETP, ETF market that people will, for diversity purposes, list across a range of venues. But it's not really economically driven. It's really diversity driven. We have such a strong offering with 92% of AUM at NYSE and you could see with \u2013 in the face of the pressure you talked about, 82% of the AUM that was listing in the first quarter came to us. The reason that that is such a strong venue is that we have very, very deep liquidity on the exchange, the NYSE Arca exchange where we list these platforms, market makers, infrastructures are rule set that really enables these innovative and fabulous listings to come to us and know that they have every opportunity for growth and success. NYSE is a brand that is known around the world, and we have been pass-ported into most countries, and so the platform that we can offer somebody in terms of distribution is really unparalleled. And it's those things that are driving the listings. I don't believe that payment for order flow is going to have a material impact on this business nor should it. And I also, as you probably know, think it's a corrosive mechanism that actually ultimately hurts markets and so hopefully I'm right and we won't see that corrode these really neat, innovative ETPs that are coming out. Brian Bedell : Great. That's great color. Thank you very much Operator : And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to the management team for any closing remarks. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : Thank you, Rocco. I appreciate your help on the call. And thank you all for joining us today. We're going to look forward to updating you on our progress as we move through the balance of the year. Have a good day. Operator : And thank you, sir. This concludes today's conference. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Kelly Loeffler. Ms. Loeffler, please go ahead. Kelly Loeffler : Good morning. ICE's second quarter 2016 earnings release and presentation can be found on the Investors section at theice.com. These items will be archived, and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our Form 10-K for 2015. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including adjusted income, operating margin, expenses, EPS, EBITDA, and tax rate. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. In the appendix of our presentation and earnings press release, you'll find a summary of our GAAP results, a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP terms, and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful, as well as how management uses these measures. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses, and adjusted earnings refer to adjusted diluted earnings per share. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the year-over-year figures we will discuss reflect comparisons against adjusted pro forma 2015 results. With us on the call are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Chuck Vice, President and Chief Operating Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Scott. Scott A. Hill: Thank you, Kelly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on slide four and highlight that the second quarter was our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth. Our performance was driven by revenues that grew 7% and adjusted operating expenses that declined 1% year-over-year. We generated adjusted operating income growth of 15% and expanded adjusted operating margins by 3 points to 56%. Adjusted earnings per share grew 13% versus the prior year to $3.43 and with continued momentum in our transaction business in July, growing data revenues and lower expenses, we're well positioned in 2016 to extend our decade-long track record of double-digit earnings growth. As you'll see, as I move to slide five, our second quarter performance contributed to strong results for the first half of 2016. We generated consolidated net revenues of $2.3 billion during the first half of the year. Both our trading and clearing segments and our data and listings segment grew 6% versus the first half of 2015. This solid top-line growth combined with disciplined expense management allowed us to expand operating margins by 5 points to 58% and to grow earnings per share 16% to $7.12. Additionally, we generated record operating cash flow of $1.1 billion in the first half of 2016 which enabled us to pay over $200 million in dividend even as we reduced our leverage to 2.4 times just six months post the closing of our Interactive Data acquisition. These strong financial results, enabled by our globally diverse business model, supported our board's authorization of $1 billion share repurchase program and our $0.85 per share dividend for the third quarter. We also announced plans to pursue a 5-for-1 stock split to ensure that our stock trades as efficiently as possible in a fragmented market and that it is more accessible to a broad range of shareholders. Let's move to slide six where I'll provide some more details in our first half revenue performance. 52% of the $2.3 billion in revenue came from our data and listings segment, and 48% came from our trading and clearing segment. Each segment grew 6% year-over-year. You'll find further detail on each segment's revenue on the right side of this slide. In the trading and clearing segment, commodities revenues grew 10% with strong contributions from both our energy and ag markets. Financials revenues grew 2% with continued strength in our equity index markets partially offset by muted European interest rate volume. Notably, volume in ICE bread, sugar, other ags, MSCI, and U.S. cash equities each grew double digits during the first half of the year. Within our data and listings segment, pricing and analytics revenues grew 6% and exchange data revenues increased by 13% year-to-year. This strong performance was enabled by a high retention rate of existing customers, the acquisition of new customers, and the development of new and enhanced products designed to efficiently deliver more value to all of our customers. Each of our data offerings are benefiting from customers' recognition of the increasing value of readily-available easy-to-consume information. This nascent trend reflects our customers' need to deal with the challenges of the volatile markets and uncertain political and economic environments in which they operate. We continue to expect our full-year 2016 data revenues to grow between 6% and 7% on a pro forma basis despite the recent significant decline in the pound sterling, in which roughly 9% of our total data revenues are billed. Further, though we expected currency impact to cause a sequential decline in revenues of $6 million in third quarter, we believe fourth quarter data revenues could approach $500 million even at current spot rates. Finally, listings revenues grew 3% over the prior first half and we hosted some notable IPOs as activity picked up late in the second quarter. Going forward, we're confident that our unique market model and strong issuer services will continue to support the capital raising needs of the world's most innovate companies and exchange traded product issuers. Please turn to slide seven where I'll discuss our disciplined expense management and provide updated and improved guidance. First half adjusted operating expenses declined 4% year-over-year to $970 million and pro forma operating margin expanded by 5 points. As we continue to integrate our acquisitions and streamline our operations, we are realizing Interactive Data synergies sooner than expected. The majority of our corporate functions are well along the path to integration. Our technology and operations teams have built clear integration roadmaps. And perhaps most importantly, the ICE Data sales team is now fully integrated and well-positioned to better serve our customers with a complete range of data solutions. Given our solid execution, we now expect to realize roughly $50 million in synergies from Interactive Data this year and approximately $100 million in combined expense synergies during 2016. Accordingly, we now expect our full-year adjusted expenses to be in a range between $1.94 billion and $1.97 billion including adjusted expenses in the range of $485 million to $495 million in the third quarter. This updated and improved full-year guidance reflects the $60 million improvement from our guidance at the beginning of the year. This improvement consists of an additional $25 million in synergies and roughly $35 million largely related to the currency impact of the lower pound. We run a diverse global business that is subject to currency fluctuations. Given the size of the change in the pound related to the Brexit vote, I want to take a brief moment to give you some color on how you should think about this in the context of our second half financial performance. With roughly 11% of our total revenues and 15% of our consolidated expenses denominated in pounds, we have a natural hedge that mitigates a meaningful portion of the impact to profit. Therefore, even though the currency driven decline in revenue exceeds the expense reduction on a dollar basis, we expect the net impact to earnings to be immaterial and it will not impede our ability to extend our track record of delivering double-digit earnings growth to 11 years. I'll conclude my prepared remarks on slide eight with a review of our cash generation, leverage and capital return. We generated record operating cash flows of $1.1 billion in the first half of the year and deployed that cash to invest around $150 million in CapEx to reduce our debt by nearly $800 million and to return over $200 million to shareholders through dividends. We reduced our leverage from 2.8 times at the end of 2015 to 2.4 times at the end of June. We believe that by the end of this year or early next, we can reduce our leverage to a level that will continue to support our strong investment-grade rating even as we increase our capital return and consider other strategic investments. This solid cash generation and rapid deleveraging supports our board's authorization of a new $1 billion stock buyback program and our ability to grow our cash dividend as we grow. Our record first-half results reflect our commitment to serving customers and generating strong returns for our investors. We are expanding and improving the products we offer in the markets we serve. We are growing revenues, earnings and cash flows. We are reducing expenses, debt and leverage, and we have invested strategically to build a diverse business model that we believe will allow us to continue to deliver consistent earnings growth, solid cash generation and leading returns on investments. I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A, but for now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : Thank you, Scott, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'll provide an update on our strategy that's delivering the strong growth that we've detailed this morning, and then we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. On slide nine of the results of our strategic approach to transforming our company into a global financial services leader, since our IPO in November of 2005, we've grown EPS five-fold, and we've grown our share price ten-fold by building on the changing needs of our customers. Rather than simply retracing the past to seek growth, we've been future-focused on the intersection of financial services and technology to offer more services to our expanding base of customers. We began as an energy trading platform and strategically transformed the company to become a global operator of exchanges and clearing houses, and become a top-tier provider of proprietary data solutions. This successful evolution of our business occurred despite the financial crisis, evolving regulations, tumultuous global markets and economic cycles. We stayed focus amid these dynamic times on innovating to solve our customers' challenges, bringing solutions long before they were widely appreciated by the market. This very point is highlighted on slide 10, where you could see the virtuous cycle created by our global ecosystem of exchanges, clearing houses, information and connectivity, which is an unparalleled model relative to more specialized data providers and market operators. Data and trading are symbiotic and serve as integral inputs into our customers' workflow. For many customers, access to our data drives more trading, which in turn creates the information used for investing, for settlement, compliance, collateral management, reporting and numerous other functions, all of which drive the rising consumption of data. The services listed on this slide represent solutions across a vast range of our clients' workflow. And because these services are part of an integrated offering, they create a strong value proposition. For example, our markets are widely accessible via the ICE Desktop, Mobile and Messenger applications, which we offer integrated solutions for our customers' trading, information and risk management needs on a common technology platform. We also offer vast sets of proprietary data for non-exchange-traded fixed income markets, which represent some of the world's largest addressable markets. Today, we're pricing millions of bonds for thousands of customers each day, and within the fixed income markets, invested assets under management continue to rise. For example, exchange traded fixed income funds have quickly risen to over $585 billion, now accounting for 20% of total U.S. ETP assets under management. ICE also has an expanding set of solution to serve active fixed income managers, such as pricing and reference data, continuous evaluated prices, liquidity indicators and best execution identification. The role of these new services is highlighted around the times of market volatility and the Brexit vote was an example of an event that has reinforced the importance of real-time information tools. In addition, ongoing demand is being driven by regulation, by market fragmentation, volatility and the uncertainty around global Central Bank actions. You can see on slide 11 that our approach to driving change has produced consistent top-line growth with record annual earnings for the last decade regardless of the economy or the market cycle or commodity prices or the level of interest rates or increasing regulation or the many other headlines and headwinds that have occurred over the last 10 years. It is such market and economic disruptions that make our risk management services valuable and ICE's performance relative to the broader sector over the same time validates the model that we built to benefit from change. In that context, I'll say a few words about Brexit, which we view as another opportunity to drive our set of differentiated solutions. We've dedicated meaningful resources to our London operations and for good reasons. The United Kingdom has tremendous location and time zone advantages in global markets. It has a strong set of regulatory and legal frameworks that have promoted confidence. And ICE has a highly qualified team of colleagues that has, time and time again, contributed to our successful navigation of change. Since the Brexit vote, we've had an active dialogue with senior officials in the UK government to discuss the types of policies that will facilitate our continued investment. We're looking forward to this ongoing dialogue, and we're very optimistic about the government's focus on preserving a competitive climate for business. ICE also operates exchanges and clearing houses in the U.S., Canada, Singapore and in Continental Europe. Our decision to be globally diverse is a result of customer demand to have choices for important markets in local jurisdictions. We've been open and transparent about our views, that there will be continued fragmentation and balkanization of markets as they've become more electronic and more locally regulated. These trends and unpredictable events, like the Brexit referendum and Central Bank moves, remind the market of the value of having different data sets readily available. And we believe that these factors increase the need for our proprietary data and the relevance for our globally distributed model. Moving now to slide 12, I'll review the solid performance in our global markets. The strength of our markets is demonstrated by the fact that trading and clearing revenues for 12 of our 13 key markets grew year-to-year in the second quarter. As you can see on the slide, volume in open interest in our crude, agriculture, sterling, and MSCI products is strong and growing. Another benefit of operating diverse global markets is the ability to gain both exposure and diversification. For example, while European interest rates, which made up 4% of our total revenues, was the one asset class where transaction revenues declined year-to-year in the second quarter, we earned market data revenues from that business. And, importantly, trading and clearing volumes, again, grew by double digits in June and July. Moving to slide 13, I'll note the 14% revenue growth in our cash equities markets year-to-date, which produced strong U.S. cash flow and enables us to serve one of the largest global securities markets with data and listings. We've continued to improve and enhance this market over the last two and a half years since our acquisition, while growing revenues and expanding market share at the same time. On the right side of the slide, you can see the ongoing contribution of credit derivatives clearing in both Europe and the U.S. We've seen greater regulatory certainty in the U.S. draw more CDS clearing to the U.S. and away from Europe, with record-level participation from the buy side. I'll note that we're approaching the milestone of $100 trillion in notional value cleared by ICE. Through a great deal of innovation, we now clear nearly 600 credit derivative instruments driving $53 million in revenue in the first half. Last week, we announced our agreement to sell the U.S. voice brokerage asset of Creditex to Tullett Prebon, which represents approximately 10% of our global CDS revenues. ICE is not selling the valuable electronic post-trade assets of Creditex that helped us support the launch and are a continuing contributor to our ongoing operations in CDS clearing. We're also retaining Creditex's electronic trading assets, as we continue to build on our solutions for the credit markets. As we announced yesterday, we've seen early traction in our new single-name CDS electronic trading platform called ICE Swap that we launched in June. This is an all-to-all platform for single-name CDS, which has gotten the attention of major dealers and buy-side clients, who are asking for more liquidity and transparency in these markets. So, we've been very strategic with the acquisition of Creditex by leveraging it to create a group of assets that have generated a positive return on that original investment and which continue to contribute to our earnings. Turning to slide 14. I'm pleased to say that not only is the integration of Interactive Data running ahead of schedule, but more importantly we're well on track to achieve our 2016 revenue growth targets. In June, we announced the reorganization of all of our data businesses into ICE Data Services, which brings together our analytics, desktops, mobile apps, indices, exchange data, and connectivity solutions under a global data brand to serve our customers comprehensively. While there remains much integration work yet to be done, the early feedback from our customers is that we're on the right track. Our ICE U.S. Treasury Index family has grown with new indices and new customers. They've been selected as the new benchmarks for a range of ETPs now offered by BlackRock iShares, the leading provider of fixed income ETPs; Direxion, a provider of ETPs with over $10 billion in assets under management; and Yuanta Securities Investment Trust Company, a comprehensive financial services firm serving the Asia Pacific region and Invesco PowerShares recently filed to begin using ICE indices in ETP products. Our revenue mix from transactions-based revenues towards more recurring subscription-based revenues continues to grow as the evolution of the market continues to transfer value to these mission-critical offerings. With a high revenue renewal rate in our pricing and analytics business, we become a key source for consistent reliable pricing and reference data. We're often asked if the growth of our data business is levered to the head count at the banks. It is not. First and most evidently, our data revenues have grown during and since the financial crisis. While head count in parts of the financial services industry may have declined since that time, the need for information, connectivity and risk management from ICE has risen, consistent with our data revenues. The consumption of data is rising due to secular trends such as the move to indexation, the rise of ETPs, market fragmentation, independent valuation demand, regulatory reporting, real-time distribution needs and automated trading. The sheer breadth of our services and our positioning at the value-added end of the data spectrum gives us confidence in our growth projections. Turning to our listings business. The market for initial public offerings improved once the volatility of the first quarter abated. The New York Stock Exchange continues to lead in global proceeds rate, including hosting the five largest IPOs by market cap to-date in 2016. Those are LINE Corporation, China Online Education, U.S. Foods, MGM Growth and Patheon. NYSE also was the home for the two largest technology IPOs year-to-date, LINE and Twilio. NYSE Arca continues to lead in new ETP listings and hosts 92% of assets under management. We're working closely with issuers to develop more solutions and value-added services in addition to enhance the market quality. Importantly, the listings business also drives growth across our trading and data lines. You can see that even as we deliver on our synergies, the NYSE is a growth-oriented business for us, and we're proud of the work that our team has done to strengthen and grow this valuable business. I'll conclude my remarks on slide 15, where you can see we are very well positioned to build on our decade-long track record. Our strong start for the year was driven by revenue growth, faster synergy realization, margin expansion, and 19% as-reported adjusted earnings growth in the first half of this year. We also generated over $1 billion in cash flow, repaid nearly $800 million in debt, demonstrated our commitment to capital return with a $1 billion share repurchase authorization, and announced a planned stock split. So, I'd like to thank our customers for their business, and I want to thank our team for their continued hard work. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to our operator, Keith, who'll be glad to take your questions. Operator : Yes. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And the first question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Kenneth B. Worthington: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First, you had really quite good growth on the exchange data side. Can you talk about why this growth is occurring now? If you look at the numbers sort of last year at this time was essentially flat for all four quarters, but you've seen really huge growth for each of the last two quarters. What's going on? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : Thanks, Ken. This is Jeff. Well, it's interesting because I've tried to make the point on multiple calls now that we believe that the markets are going to become more fragmented, now that they're more electronic and more \u2013 regulation is being put on markets at the local level. And in some of our core markets, what you've seen is some people come in and pay for order flow. And so, what we've done is readjusted essentially our data offering and the way we disseminated and charge for it so that we can benefit from those payments into the market. So, when somebody pays for order flow, you attract a new kind of trader; and you, actually in our mind, grow the market by bringing people in that want to receive those payments. And those people tend to hang on the primary market in order to receive those payments. And so, what we do is basically have a compact with them that they will receive those payments and pass some of them back to us in the form of increased data revenues. When a company goes in and wants to get paid for order flow, it tends to do one of two things. It either uses algorithms or its own trading style to basically churn so that it is constantly buying and selling but accepting no risk, or they come up with strategies where you can put on positions that actually show up in open interest but they carry no risk. And so, there have been a lot of talk in our industry about market share. People like to talk about market share. And we like to talk about earnings. And that's why I always start my recent presentations showing you our earnings growth because we have decided that the way to maximize our earnings growth is to participate in that trend with our customers who want to receive payments from others. And so, there's been a big spike-up in that area, and I expect honestly that this is a macro trend that we're going to see more fragmentation due to a number of factors and that you'll continue to see growth in our core data offering. Kenneth B. Worthington: Great. That's awesome. Just maybe on a completely separate note, I just had sort of a long-term aspiration of building a swaps-clearing operation for interest rate products. I guess, do you still have those hopes or expectations of getting into that business? Could Brexit actually help you crack that market? And I guess maybe it's been a couple of years since New York, is it still possible to build this operation or if you still want to get in there, is acquisition the only realistic way to do it? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : It's a good question and a difficult nut to crack in the sense that we do continue to build out continued capabilities in risk management to serve fixed income and interest rate markets, and that is \u2013 that has been a constant source of investment for us, as you've indicated, over a number of years. Whether or not we actually would enter that space on our own is yet to be determined. There is some M&A going on right now, the LSE-DB deal. It's hard to understand what kind of offering that deal will have, given the fact that they're now in two different regulatory jurisdictions. It's hard to understand what the complexities of regulation may be between the UK and the EU. So, that may open an opportunity or it may foreclose an opportunity. It depends on how things play out. I would also mention to you that the interest rate swaps business in our mind is largely people doing fix-for-floating swaps. In other words, commercial borrowers, like ICE and Scott Hill, who is sitting across from me, may choose to lock in floating interest rates for a period generally five years or so. But in this low interest rate environment, it's hard to imagine that locking in low interest rates is a growth market. And so, one of the things that we promise is earnings growth and we tend to look for trends where we can position ourselves early to be part of the growth, and it's very unclear whether the interest rate swaps market is one of those markets. So, I say all of that in the sense that we've not made a decision yet on what to do and when to do it, but we do continue to build out capabilities so that we have optionality around that decision. Kenneth B. Worthington: Awesome. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Richard Henry Repetto : Yeah. Good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Scott. Congrats on a very strong quarter. I guess I want to follow up on the first question, the exchange \u2013 the increase in the exchange market bid. I don't think I understand the answer. And I guess, to clarify, are there any offsetting expenses to the increase in exchange data? Or, I guess, could we try another run at it, because I'm not sure what you're talking about when \u2013 is it the rebate that you're paying or someone else is paying? Scott A. Hill: Yeah. So, Rich, let me comment \u2013 put a couple of metrics around what Jeff said. I mean, effectively, what he said is there are more people who are more active in the markets that we provide and we've seen that in user growth. We've seen it in the products that we've been able to package up in our data. So, the interest levels have continued to grow. And as we sign up more users, as we're able to offer more information in various forms or various packages of information, we've seen fee increases related to that. And so, that's really help drive the revenue. To some extent, when you look at our commodities growth in the first half at 10%, that's across the energy and ags, and there's a lot of volatility in those markets, a lot of drivers that are \u2013 and there are different drivers. It's weather in Brazil, its Middle East and U.S. oil issues that are driving oil. And as you're trying to figure out what's going on and evolve (31:15) the world, you need data and you need information. And so, as people see that need, as Jeff was describing it, we see user growth, and we see existing users wanting more information, and all of that's contributed to very strong growth in that business. And the thing that excites me about it is not just the data revenue growth in and of itself, but that data growth coupled with very strong open interest in our commodities business is a good leading indicator, not necessarily for any given month or quarter, but as we look forward, it says the interest in the markets we're serving remains very high with importantly the commercial customers who are actually taking a view on price and actively managing the risk. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : And, Rich, let me just be more obvious. If you stand on a corner and hand out $5 bills, a long line will form. If in order to get into that line, you have to pay the primary market $1 so that you can get 4 of those dollars; that is a good trade. And so, what we do is set up to make sure that our shareholders get the transfer of that $1 from the other person's shareholder. And much of what we've been doing over the last few years and the way we've been building out this data offering and distribution vehicle is set up for that. We firmly believe that markets are going to become more fragmented. It's very different today when there used to be open outcry floors in regional jurisdictions with the name of the city on them, it was very hard to compete. Today, there are a lot of very sophisticated electronic platform operators that can simply pay for order flows and start a market. And so, we believe that there will be fragmentation. We've seen it in the most fragmented markets that we operated in, in the U.S. cash equities market. But what changes there is that as those payments are made, there's an opportunity to participate in them and that's really what we've been doing. So, we laugh a little bit around here when people put notes out talking about market share and fail to realize that behind that the market has actually grown, and there's more wealth transfer going on and our goal is to maximize the value of this company for our shareholders. Richard Henry Repetto : Just one follow-up on this, like take for example, the fragmentation in the energy markets with a new entrant, is that somewhere \u2013 where you're not necessarily paying the rebate, but you are benefiting potentially because on exchange energy market data because you are still the significant player that has all the data. Is that a fair representation? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : Yeah. I think as you go away and look at the numbers that we just put out, you're going to see that we beat on revenue and on earnings, largely because we have been able to monetize our historical data to new entrants that want to participate in those payment floor closed (34:25) schemes. What we have not done is actually go into that market and expand the market further again by paying more people for order flow. We've kept our basic core operation, and then decided to work with these new entrants. And we know who they are. We have sales people, there's constant conversation. There are people that approach us that want those payments. And so our strategy has been we can't stop what others do, but let's make sure that we participate and maximize our own footprint. Richard Henry Repetto : Got it, got it. And one quick follow-up, I think there's going to be a very short answer here. With Brexit, has it changed your view of the Deutsche Boerse-LSE merger? How do you think about that? At least the view we're getting is the probability of a deal has gone down directionally. I don't know what the actual numbers are, but directionally. Has that changed your view on potentially looking at that transaction? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : That's a short question, but it's probably a long answer. Richard Henry Repetto : I could pass it. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : No, no, I'll answer it. When we looked at that transaction and decided that we were not going to go forward, we were very open to say that we had some concerns that we didn't have enough information to put a credible bid on the table. What I didn't say at the time that I can say now is that at the time, we did not want to talk about Brexit, and we had been urged by others not to talk about Brexit. But the way that deal was lining up, it was orchestrated so that we were going to, if we entered the deal, have to put a number on the table, right ahead of the Brexit vote. We happened to have at the time, three UK directors who sat on our board, who are incredibly knowledgeable people that are very engaged with us. And they were cautioning management and the rest of the board that the Brexit vote was going to be close, and they cautioned us back in February and March. And really said, you guys need to know exactly what you're doing and you need to run scenarios on what's going to happen in either eventuality. So, we went out and we started talking to our UK colleagues to try to gauge where we thought the vote was going to come out. And honestly, we came to the opinion that the UK was probably going to leave. And so, we decided \u2013 given that we didn't have good information and given that we thought the landscape was going to change, that it was not an appropriate time for us to do a transaction. And I think we were fortunate in making that decision. I don't know what the European landscape is going to be. We have been building our company to have a lot of options, and we've been very open about that. We've been very transparent that we, long ago, decided to build a footprint on the Continental Europe with an exchange and clearing house because we felt that there could be some fragmentation and balkanization that our customers would have demands. So, we're set up for change, but I don't know what the change is going to be. And, so it's hard, for anyone in any position in financial services to discuss what the outcome of Europe is going to look like. Richard Henry Repetto : Understood. That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Michael Roger Carrier : Thanks, guys. Scott, maybe just on the capital front, just given the pace that you've been moving on paying down debt and then the buyback authorization, just wanted to get maybe an update on where the target is that you want to get to, to be comfortable, particularly with rating agencies. And then just timing, particularly, when we're thinking about 2017 pursuing the buybacks versus obviously just other opportunities that you guys have been busy on in terms of acquisitions and investing in the business? Scott A. Hill: Yes. Michael, I'll give you a shot at the answer, and if I miss anything, you just have to follow up. So, I said on the last call that our objective is to operate with leverage somewhere in the 1.75 times to 2.0 times range and that's still the case. We've had very open dialogue with the ratings agencies, and they've indicated a comfort level with our current rating in that range. I don't think that means we have to necessarily be in that range to start the repurchases, but we certainly need to have a path to get to that range quickly as we introduce the repurchases. And so, in terms of timing, the other thing I'd say, there's always a number of variables. You asked about M&A in 2017. I have no idea what that could look like. We've got the S&P deal that we expect will close later this year. You've got the Cetip BM&F deal that is working its way through the process. So, there's any number of factors that could impact the timing and the size of the repurchases. I think what the authorization tells you is we are deleveraging at a faster rate than we anticipated. We had originally said we wouldn't be there until the end of next year. Now, we're saying possibly by the end of this year. And so, look, I don't think it's out of the question that we're back in the market in the fourth quarter, but there'll be a number of variables that impact that. And, I wouldn't expect this to go from zero to 100 miles an hour in the first quarter that we start to buy back shares. Michael Roger Carrier : Got it. Makes sense. And then, just as a follow-up, just on the data business, you guys spend a decent amount of time on the exchange new data, I guess just looking at the pricing analytics and the desktop connectivity, you both mentioned some of the drivers of the overall 6% to 7% growth in terms of the retention of clients, the new clients signing up, some of the new products out there. I don't know if you have any stats, but just trying to get a sense on when you look at kind of the momentum that you're seeing in that business based on the growth rate that you put out for 2016, what's the longer term growth potential? And, again, mostly focus on the other two segments, just given that you gave a lot of color on the exchange side. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : Well, we've only owned the business, the Interactive Data business, for six months and we've only really been reorganized for a few weeks in terms of how our sales force is starting to take our combined product offering to market. But the early returns are really good. We see a lot of interest by large buy-side firms, for example, who want to have vendors that they can trust, who have a breadth of data, who meet their cyber security demands and give them sort of a single point to go to. Right now, honestly, if you just step back and think about the world and your own behavior, the amount of data that we're all consuming just goes up. I mean, I have no doubt that the data plan that I have on my smartphone is going to consume more data in five years than it does today. And in every aspect of our lives and certainly here at ICE, the way we run our business, there is just more data available. And we have better and better tools to use that data and analyze that data. When it comes to trading and risk management, there's no question that we're going to have more passive investment vehicles. Those are doing well and growing and growing quickly. There's no question that decisions are going to be made increasingly by algorithms or they're going to contribute to the decision-making process. And in my mind \u2013 and there's no question that regulators are going to demand \u2013 and, frankly, board of directors and the audit committee and auditors are going to demand better information faster than they've gotten it before. And so, all those trends just suggest to us that there is an incredible future demand for information. And what we are trying to do is figure out areas where we really generate some unique proprietary content that will be of high value to our customers. And so, that's been our focus. And so far, the early returns have been really good. And frankly, on some of the sales meetings that I've been in, we've gotten a lot of positive feedback that it's nice to have a large-scale vendor of information to people that is very technology-focused and cyber security focused like we are to fit into their current demands for information. Michael Roger Carrier : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Daniel Thomas Fannon : Thanks. I guess, just following up on kind of the IDC outlook, just curious if there's been any implementation of price increases thus far and kind of the outlook for that in terms of your guidance for this year and maybe into next with regards to just the pricing side? Scott A. Hill: Yeah. Dan, I'd go back to what Jeff said. We only own the business six or seven months. I think the success we're seeing right now is really, again, around the continued high retention of existing customers. Jeff's point about \u2013 as we talk to customers, their interest in having a data provider. And so, it's \u2013 the post that's showing up as SuperD or as ICE or as IDC, we're showing up as ICE Data Services. And I think we're seeing benefit from that in terms of securing new customers. And again, as I said on the exchange data side, similarly, in the pricing and valuation side, I think it's customers who are purchasing more. It's beginning to gain traction in new products, continuous value of the pricing product that allows you during the day to get a view on the price of bonds that you may be interested in trading or that you hold in your portfolio, that's execution services. So, it's really more, right now, new customers, retention of existing customers, building on new product development that actually started before we purchased IDC. I think to Jeff point, we've only really reorganized the sales team and the go-to-market in the past few weeks. So, I think that's why I'm confident about our ability to grow the rest of this year. And in the next year, as we do look at are we capturing the right value in our pricings, are there different ways we can package up across the various businesses that we've owned, are there better ways that we can deliver the information more efficiently across a single desktop versus multiple, et cetera. So, that's really the benefit I think that's in front of us, not that's reflected in the strong performance we've had in the first half. Daniel Thomas Fannon : That's helpful. I guess, in response to most of these questions, the phrase new customers has come up a lot. I guess, can you give us some a little bit more context as to the segmentation of that or geography commercial versus financial, high frequency verse sell-side, buy-side? A little bit of context there would be helpful I think. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : I think one of the things that IDC has done for us is that it brought to us a dedicated sales force that had, to use an old term, a Rolodex, and really is very much centered on buy-side and as well as asset managers and intermediaries to asset managers. We're providing execution or regulatory services or custodial services. But that area was not an area that traditionally ICE had direct relationships with. And so, the reason that we're excited about some of the bundling and packaging and the reorganization of our sales force is that it opens a whole new customer base to us. And what we have found, as I mentioned before, is that customer base who often times deals with lots of data vendors, appreciates having another large comprehensive offering so that it can be kind of a one-stop shop when it comes to purchasing and security issues. Some of these things that we're providing are mission-critical services to companies that use them for regulatory purposes or reporting purposes, and so they need primaries, backups and others. They want as much information as they can. And having another large vendor enter the space has been very well received. Daniel Thomas Fannon : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Kenneth Hill with Barclays. Kenneth Hill : Hey. Good morning, guys. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : Good morning. Scott A. Hill: Good morning. Kenneth Hill : I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about maybe the deal appetite in the data space. I mean, you've talked a little bit on this call about how you're reorganizing the sales team and the packaging, but are there still issues you're hearing from customers or maybe perceived gaps in your data offering where you think maybe an acquisition might fit nicely. I know you guys have been rumored out there with the Citi Yield Book and then also had done something with Mortgage Electronic Registration System? So, just wanted to get your broader thoughts there? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : I think if you step back and look at what is ICE's position in the market, we're not a reseller of other people's data. We're really \u2013 people are creating proprietary content. And so, areas that are of interest to us is where are things, where there is some content that we could help monetize through our channel. That being said, as you probably know, we operate here and in M&As -we buy versus build on every decision we make as a buy versus build decision. And many of the valuations in the data space are quite high and they certainly wouldn't operate on our return on invested capital thresholds that we operate under. So, it's not as easy as saying, yeah, we're just going to go hoover up everything that's out there because there are some great companies but they are fully valued by the market right now. So, we have to be somewhat creative. I'll just quickly mention MERS. I got \u2013 years and years ago, many people on this call would ask us what is our strategy in the interest rate space. And, we knew that there were some dominant and important people in that space, and it would be hard to compete. And so we started breaking down the interest rate market and trying to think of where are the opportunities that we could enter the market and we started to focus on the mortgage space and this was before the financial crisis. And a very gracious gentleman, Bill Krueger (50:15), who was a banker at JPMorgan said, well, I can introduce you to the people at MERS. MERS is an industry consortium of 5,000 members in the mortgage community including everybody that matters in the mortgage community. And we started to talk to MERS prior to the financial crisis about whether or not there would be an opportunity to privatize it. The financial crisis intervened. MERS was involved in effectively robo-signing mortgages on behalf of lenders and got very embroiled and was put into conservatorship along with Fannie and Freddie. It has now made its way through that and it's ready to have continued investment. A new look \u2013 a new outlook and we were able to convince the members that that consortium should privatize with ICE and that we will help bring them together. About five years ago, we never announced, but we did buy a mortgage platform and a team in Silicon Valley that was working on some advanced techniques around mortgages. We've continued to quietly build that out and obviously worked with MERS over the last few years on how we could put these systems together and are thrilled to announce that we're going to work with the MERS team, that Fannie and Freddie and some of the bank interests are going to stay on the board of the company to help us. And that we think there's a really interesting opportunity to bring some evolution to the broad market for residential mortgages in the United States. Small deal in terms of how it exists today, but it could have large repercussions if we all get together and work on this successfully. So, it's great to see a long, long cycle actually close. And they feel it's been a long, long cycle as well. Kenneth Hill : Great. Appreciate the background there. Just wanted to change topics and talk a little bit globally. I mean, we've talked a lot about Europe and you guys also have a presence in Asia. I'm wondering if you can give update on Singapore Merc and may be how that's progressing? And if the outlook shifted there at all given what's going on in Europe from a customer perspective? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : It's interesting. So, the footprint that we have in Asia, what we're really trying to do out of that operation is to attract a customer that we would not have seen before. We benefited, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, from being in London, in that many Asian interests were happy to come meet us in London and do business in London. And I really do believe based on conversations we've had with the UK government that the government has incredibly strong interest in adopting policies that will continue to attract Asian business to come to London. But that being said, there are a lot of smaller players, niche players that existed in the region that were not going to come to London. And the real key that we've had in Singapore is getting to those new customers, getting them to join the exchange, getting them to set up in the clearing house. These are brokers, these are commodity merchants and others across the broad region of Asia, and we've had good success there. And really, if you look at our focus, it's not on day-to-day volume. It's on chipping away at a targeted customer list and getting them through the process that the MAS, the regulator in Singapore, requires to be passported into a Singapore exchange and clearing house. And that work is ongoing and it's going well, and every day \u2013 it is a network effect. So every day that somebody new joins or takes interest, it spills over to the next person. And so, we feel like we're making very good progress there. Kenneth Hill : Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein : Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : Good morning. Alexander Blostein : Question around the fixed income ETF business, it seems like it's been a pretty robust growth in the market space this year. And I think we would argue there's a lot of secular opportunities for that market space to grow further. Can you talk to us a little bit about the opportunity for ICE to monetize this trend? It seems like you could really come on a couple of \u2013 across a couple of different areas on the listing side, trading side, and maybe the data side. So, help us understand, I guess, how meaningful a trend that could be for you, guys? And then, secondly, maybe we can hit on the competitive landscape for ETF listings as well? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : Sure. Well, first of all, when we talk to sponsors of ETFs in that community, they are incredibly bullish on the demand for fixed income ETFs. It is a real growth area. And so, there's tremendous interest by sponsors in that arena to talk to us about what we can do. We have a unique ability in that we had an ETP listings team of very good and well-known ETP listings team at the NYSE, which we were able to combine with our index and data people and put together essentially packages that we can take to these ETP providers where we can develop an index or replace an index. We can provide the data. We have the systems internally to do real-time calculation and NAV calculations. We can list it. We can help them market it. We can use the ICE brand. We can use the NYSE brand. So, we bring a lot of assets to the table with these providers, and we're aggressive and we're interested in this space. And so, we're able to move quickly. So, I think it's going to be a growth area for us. In terms of how it's monetized, we don't really care in a package whether it's monetizing the data or monetizing the index or monetizing the infrastructure. All of that can go together in a cauldron that can be very value-enhancing for these ETP providers. There's no question that it is a competitive space, and that people there are interested in speed-to-market and they're interested in low administrative costs. And so, once we get those ETPs up, then we continue to market the fact that we have continuous evaluated pricing, that we have these liquidity indicators that \u2013 and honestly, we \u2013 then we go to the active fund managers and talk to them about how are they going to respond to this passive trend and what can we do for them. So, it's a really unique moment in time, and we're kind of hitting a sweet spot in the space in our mind with an opportunity set and capabilities set that we have. So \u2013 I'm sorry, what was the second...? Alexander Blostein : Got it. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : ...second part of your question was... Alexander Blostein : Well... Scott A. Hill: I think the second part was really around the competitive environment. I think the point there is, if you look at assets under management in that space, we've got 92% that are listed at the New York Stock Exchange. And so, as Jeff alluded to, we've got the experience, we've got a highly qualified team and we've got a history of being the place where ETPs come to list. And so, from a competitive standpoint, it's a good place to build from. We certainly don't take it for granted, and that's why, as Jeff said, we're constantly developing additional capabilities to bring to customers. But we like the competitive position we have today. It's a good starting point and a good place to build from. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : Yeah. None of what I just suggested there that we can offer those ETP provider says, hey, we're going to pay for order flow or some other economic deal. This is really about how can we partner and create value together with each other. We \u2013 NYSE Arca is where 92% of the AUM exists. That is a single exchange. It has very deep liquidity on a single exchange. We have other competitors that like to add together three or four exchanges and then show a number, but the ETP sponsors don't really care about the volume across a bunch of fragmented markets. They want to know is there depth of liquidity in the market where this thing is primarily going to trade. That is a real competitive advantage that we have. And then, when we couple that with all the other services that we can provide that are value-added, we've seen that we continue to do very well. I would mention there's something like four new ETP listings per day. So, the vast majority, unfortunately, like any new business, are probably not going to grow very big or amount to much. They become highly differentiated and specialized, in many cases. But this broad area that you started your questioning of bond ETF is one where there is tremendous demand, it seems, by wealth managers and investors who see the convenience of not having to deal with individual bond securities (01:00:05). Alexander Blostein : Got it. Thanks. Thanks for the detailed answer. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : Thank you. Operator : Okay. Thank you. And the next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Alex Kramm : Hey. Good morning. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : Good morning, Alex. Alex Kramm : I guess, for Scott. You talked about the synergies obviously in 2016 and nice update there. Can you give us some early thoughts, how that, what you said today, impact 2017 and 2018? Is this just a pull forward? Do you think maybe you get everything done in 2017 and nothing bleeds to 2018 or do you actually feel confident that you could actually upsize synergies down the line after what you've seen or done so far this year? Scott A. Hill: Yeah. Look, Alex, I think what you're seeing as we go through this year is that, as opposed to the NYSE, where we announced that deal in 2012 and then had a year before it closed and a year to work on the integration plans and the synergies and so, when we came out with a number on that at close, we were like this is the number. And we subsequently executed on it really well. The IDC deal was a completely different deal. It was an auction. It closed the day we signed it, and that's really when the integration work began in earnest. And, so, we're continuing to dig through, and we are seeing early success and greater success than we had counted on in things like corporate integration, where we've been able to identify and eliminate corporate redundancies faster. We're seeing things like 7ticks network and the safety network, where we knew there might be some overlap, come together and we're realizing benefits from that sooner. And, so, that's really the acceleration of the $25 million to $50 million in this year. I don't think our view on the overall synergies related to that business really have changed. The timing hasn't changed. There is a heavy piece of technology integration that has to occur. And, as you know, with the NYSE acquisition, that's kind of the last chunk of synergies that we're going to realize there. I suspect that will be the case at IDC as well. We will certainly get the synergies, the timing of them. I'll give you an update on 2017 as we move later into this year and I'll give you an update on 2018 as we move into the later of 2017. But, we said at the beginning of the year, $220 million to go. We've now got a $100 million of that that will get done this year. I'm very confident over the course of 2017 and 2018 and maybe a little bit into early 2019, that we will get that last $120 million out of what's roughly now a $2 billion expense base. Alex Kramm : All right, very good. And, then, just secondly, coming back to the data side, just for a minute here, I think one of the things you don't talk about a lot is that you actually have a pretty big desktop presence now. I believe, like you have WebICE in the past, and I think IDC got you I think two different desktop brands and, obviously, trade for it. (63:04) So, any bigger plans for that? How should we think about \u2013 I mean, you talk about proprietary data really being your focus, but now you've got a lot of desktop space. So, can you lever that into anything more interesting or is it just a side business for you? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : When we started the company, Chuck Vice and I designed version 1.0 of what we call WebICE, which was a screen that you could log on to via the Internet. And that screen still exists today in versions that go way beyond my expertise, for sure, and has been an important part of our ecosystem. Really, for us, the focus is talking to an end user customer, saying how do you want to consume the services that we provide? We can give you an API if you want to build your own infrastructure, or we can give you certain tools that we can put on your desktop or on your phone. And because we really have upped our game after acquiring the New York Stock Exchange, when it comes to cyber security and thoughtfulness about connectivity, we're very, very good counterparty to many financial institutions that care deeply about these things. So, it is a means to an end in our mind. But we are bringing all of that together, again, as part of the sales reorganization, and the way we're going to offer and package things. And we think every day becomes a more and more powerful offering, and that's how we think about it. Alex Kramm : All right. Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Chris Allen with Buckingham. Please go ahead, Buckingham. You are live. All right. Very good. Then the next question comes from Vincent Hung with Autonomous. Vincent Hung : Hi. So, when we think about the tailwind in data from the shift independent pricing sources and regulatory requirements, how much more runway is there here? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : Well, I mean, it's hard to have a crystal ball to predict the future, but I will tell you that in markets that we see that become fragmentated, the data becomes the currency. Data is king. Information is king in fragmented markets. And we think that there's just no choice but for markets that used to be pretty global and contained to become more fragmentated due to algorithmic trading, payment for order flow, new competitors that are building digital systems and the fact that there's going to be more local regulations. So, we think that on the same time that those markets are changing and evolving, the customers are getting more sophisticated about the ability to consume data and make decisions on risk management going forward. So, I just think it's a long-term trend and I think \u2013 I've said before, I think the data package that you have on your mobile phone will be bigger in five years than it is today and the same for me and everybody that's listening. I just think that it is the unique opportunity of our times to really be connected and have vast amounts of information at your fingertips. Vincent Hung : Yeah. And just lastly, do you have any insight into the sales cycle in the IDC north of (01:07:04) the exchange data businesses? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : Yeah. Well, interesting. So, we have a high renewal rate. So, there's a vast audience of people that have agreements that have expiration dates and we have a team that goes in well before that. And those renewals happen as you can see a very high rate of renewal. And that sale cycle is an obvious one that is driven by the contracts. But for new acquisitions, we've seen some of the, as I've mentioned, some of the aggressive market participants particularly people that are doing exchange traded products and new innovative things want to have speed to market. So, those sale cycles have tended to be short. We're also seeing, I think some longer sale cycles where we're in conversations with people about wholesale changes to the way we deliver and the technology that underlies our data and the way we deliver it and the way the two of us would technologically connect and work together. Those are probably multiyear cycles because we both are committing to build kind of new infrastructure that will better scale for future demand. And then, there's everything in between. We are pleasantly surprised, I would tell you that we predicted that we could grow this business quickly and we have definitely done that. So, there is a part of the sales cycle that is moving very, very quickly to the point that you can see it in the increased growth of the businesses that we own. And so, that's the good news. But there is \u2013 we will tell you, there is a back end to it based on some of these other trends that we think will pay dividends into the future. When Scott is guiding that already can tell you what the fourth quarter number is going to be, it gives you some indication that we have visibility into the next few quarters that is pretty accurate. Vincent Hung : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. So at this time, I would like to return the call to Jeffrey Sprecher for any closing comments? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher : Well, thank you, Keith, our operator, and I want to thank all of you who joined us today. We'll continue to update you on our progress over the balance of the year and look forward to talking to you on our next earnings call. Operator : Thank you. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Intercontinental Exchange Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kelly Loeffler. Please go ahead. Kelly Loeffler - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Good morning. ICE's third quarter 2016 earnings release and presentation can be found on the Investors section of theice.com. These items will be archived, and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2015 Form 10-K. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including adjusted income, operating margin, expenses, EPS, debt-to-EBITDA, and tax rate. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. In the appendix of our presentation and earnings press release, you'll find a summary of our GAAP results, a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP terms, and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful, as well as how management uses these measures. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses, and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Unless otherwise noted, the year-over-year figures we will discuss reflect comparisons against adjusted pro forma 2015 results. With us on the call are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Chuck Vice, President and Chief Operating Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Scott. Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Thank you, Kelly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our today. I'll begin on slide four and cover our results through the first nine months of 2016. Consolidated net revenues grew 4% to $3.4 billion, with trading and clearing revenues up 2% and data and listings revenues up 6% versus the prior year. In addition, operating margins expanded 4 points to 57% and expected 2016 synergies have increased over 50% to $115 million. All of these factors enabled adjusted earnings to grow 10% versus 2015 pro forma results. This strong financial performance also generated record operating cash flow of $1.5 billion through September. This strong cash generation enabled us to reduce our leverage, grow our dividend and in October, to restart our share repurchase program. We are executing a well designed strategic plan, are efficiently integrating our acquired businesses, and are delivering top and bottom line growth, strong cash generation and improving ROIC and capital return, all less than a year after closing our acquisition of Interactive Data. Now let's turn to slide five, where I'll walk you through our results for the third quarter. Revenues in the quarter were up slightly over the prior year. Adjusted operating expenses declined 3% year-over-year and margins expanded to 55%. Adjusted operating income increased 4% year-to-year and adjusted earnings per share were $3.21. Of note, you'll see that our third quarter tax rate was roughly 30%. We currently expect a similar rate for the fourth quarter. Moving next to slide six, I'll provide some additional details about our third quarter revenues. While our total revenues were roughly flat, our data and listings segment revenue grew 5% year-over-year, and represented 55% of our consolidated revenue for the quarter. Within the data and listings segment, our exchange data was up 17% year-over-year. Pricing and analytics revenue would have grown 3% excluding the weakness in the pound and the impact of a large customer true-up that occurred in the prior third quarter. Our data revenues remain on track to grow between 6% and 7% for the full year 2016 and the outlook is favorable for at least a similar level of growth in 2017. Our trading and clearing revenues declined 4% versus the prior year as lower volatility and the precipitous fall in the pound created a significant headwind. Within the trading and clearing segment, though, commodities revenue grew 2%, including energy revenues, which grew 4% year-to-year. Oil and natural gas were both strong contributors and continued to grow in October. Despite continued growth in our OTC clearing business, financials revenues declined 14%, including interest rate revenues which were down 15%. Interest rate futures volume grew 13% in the quarter, but revenues were significantly impacted by the weaker pound. We expect to publish our October volumes on Wednesday, and despite continued currency impacts and lower volatility in equity, we preliminarily expect to report solid results including; oil volumes up around 10% and interest rate volumes growing more than 50% versus the prior year. The increased volumes, stable to improving open interest levels and continued growth in exchange data customers \u2013 interest in the markets we operate remains high. Now let's flip to slide seven, where I'll discuss our expense performance and provide updated guidance. Third quarter adjusted operating expenses declined 3% year-over-year to $484 million, and pro forma operating margin expanded by 2 points. Importantly, please also note on the right side of the slide that margins expanded in both our business segments. As we continue to integrate our acquisitions and streamline our operations, we are realizing Interactive Data synergies on an accelerated basis. We now expect to achieve around $115 million in synergies for 2016. Increased synergies and the weaker pound enabled us to maintain our full year adjusted expense guidance despite the addition of expenses related to the Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis acquisitions. For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted expenses in the range of $500 million to $505 million with the quarter-to-quarter increase due largely to the addition of these recently acquired businesses. Our final full year 2016 expense guidance reflects a reduction of nearly 3% versus 2015 and a $75 million improvement from our guidance at the beginning of the year. This improvement benefited from roughly $35 million largely related to the impact of the lower pound, but, more importantly, reflects an additional $40 million in synergies realized during 2016. I'll conclude my prepared remarks on slide eight with a review of our cash generation, deleveraging and capital returns. We generated record operating cash flows of $1.5 billion in the first nine months of the year and deployed that cash to invest around $250 million in CapEx, to reduce our debt by $1 billion and to return over $300 million to shareholders through dividends. We reduced our leverage from 2.8 times at the end of 2015 to 2.3 times at the end of September. Importantly, we remain on track to reduce leverage below 2 times during 2017, which allowed us to restart our share repurchase program in October and will support our objective to grow our dividend as we grow. We remain confident that our solid cash generation will continue to support our strong investment-grade rating, enable additional strategic investment and allow us to increase our capital returns to shareholders. Our results for the first nine months of this year reflect our commitment to execution, innovation and value creation for our shareholders. We deliver on this commitment by expanding our footprint to meet the ever-changing needs of our customers in a very dynamic time in our industry. I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Thank you, Scott, and good morning to everyone on the call. This morning, I'll take a few minutes to update you on key areas of investor interest and then we'll conduct the question-and-answer session. I'll start with the topic of consistent long-term growth on slide nine. Our 10-fold revenue growth over the last decade, including revenue that doubled and earnings that have tripled in the last three years, is driven by expanding the range of ways we serve our customers around the world. This growth continues, with total futures volume up 20% in the month of October, alongside an expanding data business that is meeting the secular demand for more information. As a start-up company, we gained a foothold by electronifying trade execution. This market transparency and product standardization then drove demand for clearing to serve the growing need for risk management. And today, as capital and operational efficiencies become paramount, our customers require more of our proprietary information to support risk management, trading, and investment management. Our services continue to evolve with changes in the market, which creates shareholder value by anticipating and capitalizing on change. As the most global exchange operator, with over 40% of our total revenues derived outside the U.S., we're moving quickly to leverage our scalable technology infrastructure across North America, Europe, and Asia. In an ever-fragmenting marketplace, we're providing the consistent tools, technology and data sources that customers require in order to stitch together the big picture on an enterprise scale. As a result, we're benefiting from balanced geographic, product, and customer diversification. And because we're not levered to any one cyclical trend or geography, we've led our space in growth on virtually every metric over the last decade. On slide 10, I'll highlight the strategy behind our balanced approach, driven by a virtuous cycle across our global markets, clearing houses, data and listings. Transaction-based revenue can be cyclical, but market participants always require information to make good risk management decisions. This is why we're establishing a new approach for market data for our customers who've told us that they're looking for flexible and efficient ways to receive and respond to information. Our investments in technology that help scale our infrastructure are allowing us to serve customers on an increasingly integrated platform. Following the financial crisis, many new opportunities to provide valuable services have emerged. Whether it's increased compliance, the move to independent pricing, demand for information security, algorithmic trading or the trend toward passive investing, each of these drives increasing demand for data. These dynamics have only begun to play out. An example is last month's SEC ruling on liquidity, which will require the measuring and reporting of liquidity risk by certain ETFs and mutual funds. Our Liquidity Indicators product is developed specifically to meet the reporting requirements in the U.S. and Europe, particularly as both the SEC and MiFID rules come into effect. To further build on our capabilities, we completed the acquisition of S&P's Security (sic) [Securities] Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis. These assets add to our portfolio of unique information that spans virtually all asset classes and provides workflow support for the front, middle and back offices. And having increased our capabilities for expanded bond price evaluations, we're developing new types of fixed income indices for institutional investors, as a complement to our Treasury Indices. We'll have more details on this in the coming weeks. We're rapidly integrating the former Interactive Data, SuperDerivatives, NYSE Index operations and ICE's exchange data to form the comprehensive global ICE Data Services organization. In the third quarter, we also completed the integration of the safety connectivity business with our 7ticks network to be in a position to offer an expanded range of service. We're focused on leveraging our broad product and client service platform to drive efficiencies for both our customers and for our company. We believe we're in the early stages of bringing our complete and flexible enterprise data solution to bear and we'll continue to update you as we build out an integrated data platform. The other component of this segment is our listings business. And while the IPO environment continues to be muted, we had a record quarter for revenue. Since ICE's acquisition of NYSE Euronext, we've listed 18 out of the 20 IPOs that raised $1 billion or more, including the largest IPO in 2016 with the listing of ZTO last week. As we always do, we're also curating our business lines to stay focused on our core capabilities. So we've decided to sell a company known as IDMS that came to us as part of our acquisition of Interactive Data. This business provides services to wealth management firms. We have also decided to sell NYSE Governance Services, which operates in the governance, risk and compliance space. While good businesses in their own right, they don't meaningfully leverage ICE's core competencies or have our strong margin growth profile and so we believe that they'll be more valuable to others within their core sectors. ICE's recurring revenue grew to over 55% of our total revenue in the third quarter, compared to just 38% in the prior third quarter. Today, the majority of our revenue is ratable and subscription-based, which allows greater visibility into cash flow generation and which provides balance to the cyclicality of the transaction segment. This also leads to less volatile earnings and more consistent cash flow, which we believe is a higher value business. On the other side of our revenue equation is highlighted on slide 11, where you can see the ongoing strength in our transaction and clearing segment, with revenues up 2% in the first nine months. In the third quarter, volume, again, grew year-to-year in energy, agriculture, metals, interest rate and MSCI indexes. Notably, year-to-date through October the volume in our European interest rate futures complex is up 17%, and surprising to many, is growing three times as fast as the U.S. interest rate futures complex traded elsewhere, even with all the speculation surrounding a potential Fed rate hike. Importantly, volume in many of our benchmark contracts are up double-digits year-to-date, including ICE Brent Crude, our agriculture complex, sterling, Euribor and our MSCI futures contracts. We also set records in our emerging contracts, such as the ICE Ares pound denominated LIBOR future. This is the first sterling denominated interest rate swap future to trade and clear on an exchange. And you can also see the solid trends in open interest, even amid a less volatile third quarter, as market participants kept their positions open heading into year-end. And we continue to grow our lead in our share of crude oil open interest. We believe that our continued growth is driven by the global relevance of our products and their exposure to the numerous international factors that are driving markets today. So I'm pleased to note that ICE Clear Europe and ICE Clear Credit both received their EMIR compliance recognition from ESMA during the third quarter. And yesterday, ICE Futures Europe received the CFTC's approval for its Foreign Board of Trade application. These are just a few examples of how the U.S., the UK and the EU have worked together to utilize equivalents rather than passporting to manage cross-border international regulatory frameworks. Our drive to grow and evolve has produced consistent growth throughout market cycles and anyone that's followed the financial markets for a few years knows that there is continuous change going on. One of those drivers of change and driver of opportunity is Brexit. The UK remains an important global market center with prudent regulation, a focus on ensuring market confidence and a strong financial services talent pool. We're maintaining an active dialog with officials in the UK government to help preserve the role of markets in London's futures. We're encouraged by the practical approach that the UK government is taking to carefully consider the future opportunities as an independent country. And similarly, we do not believe that financial market infrastructure leaving London is in the best interest of Europe's markets. Many have questioned whether we might bid for the London Stock Exchange, an opportunity that we called off earlier this year in the absence of sufficient information to establish the value of a bid coupled with our concerns about the effects on the company of a Brexit vote. Because this important asset could be leaving the city of London, we believe that this may create new opportunities for us as a leading infrastructure provider as we see the ability to continue to invest in the UK. For example, in December of last year, we invested in the London based Trayport, an operator of important technology that serves the European commercial energy markets. Recently, the CMA issued a finding that ICE-owning Trayport would have an adverse impact on competition in the European utility derivatives trading and clearing markets. And that we should therefore divest the Trayport. ICE and Trayport are not competitors, which the CMA recognized. So our acquisition of Trayport does not involve a loss of competition under a so-called horizontal theory of harm. The CMA's decision relied on a simplistic assessment of market dynamics rather than a rigorous quantitative analysis. And it also relied largely on the views of conflicted third parties that have a competitive interest in the outcome of their review. ICE produced a detailed analysis to demonstrate that we would not and could not operate Trayport in a way that impairs access. We also offered far-reaching operational and governance remedies to address CMA's theoretical concerns. So we believe that CMA's decision under such a speculative and vague theory is disproportionate and it would be a terrible precedent for future merger and acquisition activities in Europe. Therefore, it's important for us that we pursue our right of appeal in connection with this pro-customer, pro-market transaction. We're committed to continuing Trayport's operations in London. And we continue to operate the company just as we have for most of last year. Across our entire organization, our focus remains on servicing customers. And we believe that if we do the right things with our customers in mind, then we're serving our shareholders. Let me conclude my prepared remarks on slide 12, where you can see that we continue to build on our decade long track record of growth. This year again, we've grown revenues, met or exceeded synergy expectations, reduced expenses and expanded our margins, driving 16% adjusted earnings growth in the first nine months of the year. We've generated over $1.5 billion in cash flow, repaid $1 billion in debt, grew our dividend, restarted our share repurchase program, and finalized our stock split, which will occur later this week. And we're already engaged in planning for a very productive 2017. And so I'd like to thank our customers for their business in the quarter and I'd also like to thank our team for their continued efforts in meeting our growth objectives. I'll now turn the call back to the operator, Allison, and we'll be glad to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. . And our first question will come from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Yeah. Good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Scott. Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Good morning. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Good morning. Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : I guess, first question is for Scott, on the expenses, and I'm looking at slide seven, and we've talked \u2013 you made the point about increasing the synergies related to IDC. And I'm just trying to reconcile the expenses for the data and listings segment, looks flat year-over-year, and reconcile that with the expenses that \u2013 the synergies that you're taking out, just trying to see why we're not seeing it. Is it acquisition related or investments, et cetera? Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yeah. Good question, Rich. So there are a couple of factors that are at play. Number one, recall that at the beginning of the year when we talked about the synergies, we also mentioned that we'd have about a $45 million increase in compensation and that we'd be making about $30 million of investment in our products and technology. A lot of that product investment is resulting in deals like the Index deals that we're announcing in the data space, the continuous evaluative product that we've announced in that space. So there are investments there. Clearly, a portion of the compensation go to our data team who have more than earned it in the outstanding execution that they've had this year. The other thing that you see very clearly on the chart is we've had some M&A spending in the year that tipped the data space. As you might imagine, a lot of that's been around the Trayport deal. And then the last thing I'd note is a number of the synergies come through our corporate functions in the first year of any deal and those corporate expenses tend to get allocated to the segments based on revenue, because \u2013 an account that supports the company, they don't support data versus trading. And so you actually do see some of the synergies even though they're related to IDC showing up in the trading segment, just because of the way that we allocate. So, I think if you take a step back, we've laid out a pretty clear view of $115 million of synergies in the quarter, but that hopefully helps a little bit on the dynamic that you're asking about. One thing, though, I'd point out in that same area of chart seven, we've disclosed our operating margins for each of the segments. And I think that's an important story that a lot of people are missing. If you look at our aggregate margins and kind of compare that to a diverse basket of competitors, I'm not sure you get the same view you do when you look at margins in the trading segment that are 50% in the quarter and 51% year-to-date, compare those to other data companies that we compete with and then look at the trading margins, which include the New York Stock Exchange and are 61% in the quarter and 64% year-to-date. And again, compare those to our exchange competitors that we deal with. So, hopefully that helps with your direct question, but I think that area of the chart you're looking at is one I'd point a lot of investors to, because I think there's an important story that's being missed. Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Understood. It's very helpful. And, Jeff, one follow-up. You do a great job at highlighting the trends and demands in market data. And I'd say the theme or I felt like the theme last quarter was fragmentation drives increased demand for data. I guess the question relates to, you're starting to see at least in, say, one asset class, but some \u2013 a little drum beat of pushback from some of the \u2013 like market makers, et cetera, pushing back on the increased pricing for market data. So I guess the question is, how do you balance that? Is that just one asset class and are the trends that you're talking about just overwhelm sort of this pushback from some market participants? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: I think that is the answer, yes. But just to give it some context, it's always interesting to us that a lot of the people that try to benefit from fragmentation of markets then complain about the fact that it costs them more to do business in that fragmentation that they helped create. And that is what's going on. You look at where you've seen just fragmentation in the past couple of years with new entrants in the energy futures space, new entrants in the European interest rate space and look at growth of our complex in those spaces, our trading volumes have grown and our data sales in those areas have grown. In other words, this fragmentation causes arbitrage between markets. It's less easy for people to figure out where the market is at any moment in time. It's much more difficult to create a settlement price for marketing books. There's much more load, if you will, on the middle and back office for compliance, best execution and so on and so forth. All of that trend is driving demand for increased information. One point that that group that is spending more and more on data doesn't recognize is that the actual cost of data is plummeting. There is just the fact that people are buying more lower cost, declining cost information. And so the spend for many of these people is voluntary. It is because they want a holistic view of the market and they voluntarily are going out and having to buy more and more information, even though on a per unit basis, information prices have been collapsing over the last decade. So, we think the total wallet, if you will, is going to continue to increase. Regulatory pressures, back office compliance pressures, reporting pressures, things that all of us in a more regulated financial service industry are going to have to adjust to and pay for. Yes, it's expensive. Yes, it wasn't something that we had to do before. It's affecting our firm as well. But it is an irreversible trend in my mind. We still have a lot of regulation to come in to impact in Europe, MiFID for example, the differences that may come out of the EU and the UK with the actual Brexit separation. So, I would expect that that trend is going to continue. Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Understood. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Carrier from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Thanks a lot. Hey, Scott, maybe just one question on the fourth quarter, just on the expense guidance. You mentioned some of the driver was related to, I think it was some small M&A activity you had, Securities Evaluations and the Credit Market Analysis. I was just wondering, because those are relatively small, can you give us any color on maybe the revenue contribution from those transactions, just because I feel like we might have like the expense number guidance, but we don't have anything on the revenue side. Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yeah, I appreciate the question. So the increase to $500 million to $505 million in the quarter is almost solely due to those two acquisitions. And so, if you kind of back out, call it $15 million, the guidance range would have been $485 million to $490 million, which is right where we've been on average every quarter this year. And so relatively flat on a quarter-to-quarter basis. In terms of revenue, you will likely recall that I mentioned last quarter, we'd see a slight deceleration into the third quarter and then a reacceleration into the fourth, where we would approach $500 million of data revenue. That was at a time where the pound was still around 131. It's now closer to 122. And so that outlook softened a little bit. So on an apples-to-apples basis versus maybe the high $490 millions, we'd be looking at something closer to the low to mid $490 millions. That notwithstanding, I actually think data revenues in the quarter including the two acquisitions will be north of $515 million. And so those expenses that I mentioned in the earnings script will be more than offset by revenues, and then obviously that adds to our overall data business and gives us an opportunity as we combine those two companies over time. Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then, Jeff, just on the M&A side, so you mentioned, I guess, the issues with Trayport or the process of going through the \u2013 basically revisiting it and giving your side of the outlook. And then on LSE, it just sounded like based on your commentary on the outlook that there could be potential opportunities if certain firms do less in the UK. So I just wanted to get your updated view on the M&A opportunities in the space and particularly given maybe some of the regulatory hurdles versus what you guys can continue to do on paying down debt, buybacks, just going forward? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: It's a very good question. I mean, holistically when we look around at our space, we really see that there's one company that stands out, which would be a great acquisition, which is our own stock. And so, Scott moved very quickly to get back into the market and on this call announced that he's actually in the market now, that we've started our share repurchase program. If you look at the futures space globally, it's relatively flat year-to-date on volumes. If you look at the -- a lot of the other trading and clearing spaces, they're down substantially. But, yet our company is actually growing. And you couple that with this new segment that we have, our largest segment, which is really growing, in the trading and \u2013 excuse me, in the data and connectivity space. Scott mentioned in his prepared remarks that we see next year the growth we can \u2013 we have visibility because we're signing contracts right now that extend well into next year and beyond for many. We have visibility into the growth of our data business. And so we think the peg ratio of our stock is just off relative to our peers. And so that's been our focus and that's why Scott decided to disclose that we actually got in the market earlier than what I think a lot of people suggested. Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question will come from Ken Hill of Barclays. Please go ahead. Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, good morning, guys. Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Good morning. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Good morning. Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So you guys announced some enhancements to NYSE Connect for listed companies in September. I think there were some additional ones in October. And this seems to be aimed at some of your Investor Relations teams, finance teams. I was hoping you could walk through that offering because it seems like it's an area of focus for some of your competitors as well. So, what should we really expect here and then what kind of maybe additional investment might you need to do there, or any potential acquisitions that look interesting? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Sure. It's a very good question. So, first of all, NYSE has -- when we acquired the business, had a desktop that it provided to corporate treasurers and CFOs. It also has some communications tools that it uses to talk to listed companies so that listed companies can provide updates on various corporate actions and what have you as a requirement they have to the exchange. We decided to replace that infrastructure with NYSE Connect, which is what we talked about. It's basically a desktop and provides trading information. We've been building that out in a space where when we look at the space, and particularly, following up on earlier questions, there is pressure on some of the spend to lower the price of desktops particularly, and that area of data acquisition, the desktop delivery is under a lot of pressure. So having a very low cost desktop that we can provide to people to give them the basic information they need around debt and equities has been very, very well received. So, in a sense, we're a disrupter in providing such a thing. As you can imagine, we have very good data about where stocks are trading, given that we own the NYSE. And we have very good data around where bonds are trading given that we built out this fixed income platform with a number of acquisitions. And we have very good data around corporate actions for our listed companies since it's a requirement that they give that information to us. So that's a very nice desktop that we can expand on. Right now we're just focused on our listed companies. But we'll see where life takes that offering. It has almost no cost to us in terms of incremental margins. And so, it's an interesting tool in an area where there's a lot of pressure to lower cost by our customer base. Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And just for a follow-up, I think you mentioned a couple sales within your prepared remarks. Have you broken up the revenues or operating income associated with some of those businesses? Also, just wondering if, take a stab at the impact for Trayport during the quarter or how we can think about the run rate revenue expenses for that business as well? Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: With regard to Trayport specifically? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: IDMS and... (35:55) Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yeah. Okay. So with regard to Trayport, I think what we told you when we closed that deal, Ken, was that the revenues were around $80 million and then it had operating margin of about 50%. I will tell you that business has continued to perform well and so that those are the kind of numbers that you should have in your head. With regards to the other two, I don't want to give a lot of detail on the call today. But suffice it to say that as we look to divest those businesses, we will give you more information. And I'll just give you the \u2013 what I think you're thinking about it, in terms of modeling it. I'm building my budget with those businesses in and then we'll extract them at the moment if we sell them and we'll give you enough information. Suffice it to say, though, Ken, they're not material in the scheme of things to overall revenues or to overall profit. And, in fact, I would tell you, to overall profit very immaterial. Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question will come from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. First, in your deck you forecast 6% to 7% revenue growth for data in 2016 and I think, Jeff said in your comments you expect similar growth in 2017. As part of the growth \u2013 part of that growth has been driven by higher teen growth in exchange data. Can you give us a sense of how you're thinking about that growth for 2017 and whether the very high level of that exchange data growth can stay in, say, the double digits of next year and if so, how do you get there? Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Ken. The other thing I want to do is, I want to clarify one point just so it doesn't get misunderstood. We will have additional revenues from the two acquired businesses. We would have grown 6% to 7% without that. So it will help solidify that towards the high end of the range. We would have been at 6% this year without it. And frankly, on a constant currency basis, we would have been above 7% for data even without those acquisitions. But, directly to your question, we have had a very strong performance in our exchange data revenues this year. Jeff talked about it on the last call and this call. That's a solid mix of growth in customers and some additional value that we've captured as we've sold more data to existing customers. As Jeff said, while there's discussion about prices going up, the price per unit if you look at it in terms of the data that's consumed for the price, that data amount has increased significantly. So a good year this year. We would expect to have a good year again in exchange data next year. I certainly don't expect it to be on par with this year, but we have, as Jeff alluded to, seen very strong sales in our pricing and valuation business, if you will, the former IDC business and that's really what is encouraging us and gives us a good solid foundation to suggest that we could be at least at the same level of growth in 2017 as 2016. So, said differently, I would expect a bit more balanced growth among, particularly exchange data and pricing and valuations in 2017 versus 2016, which was benefited a little bit more by the exchange data. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Awesome. Thank you. And then, trailing 12 month ROIC fell to 7.8% this quarter. I have not been able to fully work through it yet. But, basically, any comments there? And then you always put in your deck set the ROIC is above your cost of capital. I notice you didn't say it that time \u2013 this time, so want to follow up there as well. Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Sure. I think at this point, Ken, it's just implied that it is. We're the only one in the space that is consistently doing it. So just under 8% versus cost of capital just over 6%, we are generating excess return on invested capital every day we operate the business. And again, that's unique in our space. If you look on an absolute basis, although we dipped to just below 8%, that relates to the IDC business that we haven't even owned for a year. If you looked at the trends coming out of the last year before that business, we were on our way back to 10%. We'll start to rebuild that as we move through this year and next and you'll see a similar trend. And again, even at the current levels, compared to the people we compete with, our ROIC compares very favorably. So we'll continue to put it on the chart, which distinguishes us. It will continue to be above our cost of capital, which distinguishes us. And it will continue to be above our competitors, which distinguishes us. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Awesome. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question will come from Kyle Voigt of KBW. Please go ahead. Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. You spoke earlier, I guess, about Brent gaining share of open interest in the crude markets and we can see those same trends, but I guess, on the volume side, we have seen some share migrate back to WTI more recently. Can you just talk about the market share dynamics in the crude markets and what's going on with some of the volume shift? And then secondly, also related to Brent, I think this time last year you had very significant growth in open interest on a year-on-year basis and I think as of yesterday, futures open interest was basically flat year-on-year in Brent specifically. So can you help us think about outlook here for growth in this contract now that we've gotten some price stability in those markets? Thanks. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Sure. So, two things are going on in our minds in the oil space. One is that WTI is really the contract that speculators use and there has been, over the last year or so, a lot of speculation about where the price of oil should go. It was $60, go down to $30, will it go back up to $50, those kinds of behaviors, particularly as the U.S. was right-sizing its drilling infrastructure and as high yield was in focus on many of the energy companies. And so, one would naturally expect that WTI, which we also have, would have more trading in that environment. Brent is and remains the contract that most of the energy space uses for hedging. And the nice thing about that is you can see that that industry continues to use Brent. The second trend that goes on is we have competitors that are paying for order flow. And there are people that in the trading business that if you pay them, they will produce volume. And our competitors that do that like to talk about market share and report market share and there's actually investors and analysts that reward them for getting market share, even though it's destroying value for shareholders. We had a large customer come to us and said, hey, one of your competitors came to us and said that they would buy our business. What are they talking about? They were not talking about to us about lowering our cost. They actually said they would pay us to move. And we said, how much did they say they would pay you? And they said, we will pay you anything, name your price. And so, with that kind of behavior you will always find some people that will take up on that. It doesn't bother us that we lose that share because we are a primary market. And as you can see from data sales and just growth in our open interest and what have you, that people tend to have to rely on the primary market in order to get paid by competitors. So, overall, trading volume goes up, but our volume, which is really the volume of people that want to pay or maybe the wallet share, if you will, continues to go up for us. And with respect to Brent, this will be, we believe, our 19 consecutive year of growth in trading of Brent. It's almost in \u2013 you put a ruler on it. It's almost an unprecedented ability when you think about everything that's gone on in the world over that 19-year period. Wars, the changes in policy, changes in regulation, financial crisis, etcetera. We continue to see Brent just -- its volume just marching forward. So we're very lucky to have that as a primary market. We are really careful custodians of it. And it's why we're not playing that game of going in and asking customers how much do you want us to pay you to do business with us. Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Just to add a \u2013 put a couple of numbers on the points Jeff made. If you go back two years, our share of volumes is about 53%. This year it's kind of mid-40%s. But back then our share of OI was a little less than 50%. Today it's 53%. So the OI is being built by commercial customers in our markets. And by the way, that doesn't even include our swap-to-futures products. If you add that in, in terms of, what the comprehensive oil commercials are trading, where they're hedging their risk, we are the place where those commercial customers come to trade their oil. Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: That's really helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Alex Kramm of UBS. Please go ahead. Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to go back to the market data discussion. I think Jeff and maybe, Scott, even as well, mentioned the incremental pressure in the customer base and people looking to reduce cost. So, I don't think that's something you've talked about so far. So, can you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in terms of the spending environment? Are sales cycles getting pushed out? Are you seeing cancellations? Are clients going out of business? And maybe more holistically, when you look at your data offering, how much of the business do you really feel like is must have like \u2013 the last thing that people turn off when they turn off a light is to close shop, and how much is more discretionary spending? Thanks. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yeah. It's great. Well, first thing I would say to you is that we see our retention rate, our renewal rate which we now have a little visibility into having owned IDC and put ICE Data Services together earlier this year, we see our retention rate is very, very high, maybe even increasing a little bit, well into the \u2013 above 90% renewal rate. So we don't see the pressure, if you will, on those businesses. When we're out talking to customers, where we hear there's a lot of focuses on data that's delivered via a desktop, a lot of focus on the number of screens, if you will, and the acquisition of desktops, we've built the safety network and combined it with the 7ticks network to build essentially a data plant that is distributed via API and we see strong growth in people wanting to buy bulk data, if you will, via an API and manage it internally and not buy it on an individual desktop basis. We're not really in the desktop space as I mentioned earlier. We have NYSE Connect, which is a desktop that is a very low cost desktop, and to a certain degree is becoming a substitution for the higher desktop providers, if you will. And so I think that's the trend that's sort of mixed up here. Alex, I really believe that the middle and back office in your firm has no choice but to \u2013 for compliance purposes and for improving systems and commoditization of the way risk is being looked at inside large firms is buying that bulk data and figuring out how to redistribute it. And I think that that trend is going to continue, because we haven't really seen the full implementation of MiFID. We haven't seen what the result of a different Brexit regime, the SEC has not fully implemented Dodd-Frank. And so there's still more pressures for compliance and in internal functions that we think will drive demand. Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC : All right. Great. Thank you. And then maybe just secondly, on the transaction side, particularly on your futures business, I think one of the things that you don't talk about much is pricing leverage. When you look at your primary competitor in the U.S., I think for the last three, four years, every year they've given updates on pricing moves that added 2%, maybe 3%. You don't really talk about that much and I think your pricing is also way more straightforward. But, how about pricing in that business? I mean, you're talking about the relevance of your products and shouldn't you be taking a little bit more pricing over time, maybe an update on your philosophy there? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yeah. I think, generally speaking, we've benefited from keeping pricing relatively untouched and allowing volume to grow. When we think about -- going back to people that pay for order flow in order to create market share, we think about the market slightly differently. We have people that really just look at markets every day and talk to customers and try to say, do we have liquidity all the way out the forward pricing curve? Are there gaps in where people try to do business and where we have markets? And so, we'll provide incentive programs to try to fill in gaps or to make the markets better for our customers. And so, we do have incentive programs which touch pricing. But they're not to get overall market share. They're really to make a better market. And we've found that consistently we've been able to grow by having that philosophy. So, to a certain degree, we haven't touched the control panel. Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC : All right. Very good. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Good morning. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Scott, I wanted to touch on the margin question. So when you look at the data business, you guys are doing 50%, obviously margins are up nicely since you acquired IDC. Where do you guys see the margins going over time? And I understand this is going to be a function both of the revenue growth as well as the expense synergies that are yet to come out. But bigger picture, could the profitability in that business ultimately get closer to where the transaction side of the business is? Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yeah, look, I don't want to predict an end state, but I certainly think there is room for continued margin expansion. And that will come in two flavors as you just said. We still do have synergies that we will extract from that business. We mentioned originally $150 million. We'll do $65 million this year, well above what we thought we'd get done in the first year. But those synergies will continue to come out and improve margins. The other thing that I've talked about a little bit that I think is really important for people to understand, the incremental margin on the proprietary data we sell is very similar to historically what you've seen incremental margins on our trading business, where it's more labor-intensive in terms of trying to determine what the price of a bond is, there are people involved with that versus oil being decided on an exchange. But once you determine that price of the bond, if I can sell it to a second customer and a third customer and a fourth customer, the incremental costs are very small. And so, revenue growth drives high incremental margins. Synergies drive margin improvements. And so I absolutely think the expectation for that business is margin expansion over time. Again, I'm not going to guess at what the end state is, but it's higher. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: And Alex, to add on to the prepared comments that I made, what ICE does really well is to use technology to build something complicated and do it one time, and then use our network to sell that thing many times. And so the businesses that I mentioned that we're going to exit and businesses that we've exited in the past when we acquired NYSE and other firms tend to be very good businesses that are growing, but they don't have the phenomenon where we can use our technology skills to build something once and our network to redistribute it. And so, for example, we're going to sell NYSE Governance Services. That is a very hot space. It's a growing space. Companies need more infrastructure to educate employees about anti-money laundering. There is a huge demand for what they do and that company has -- is growing and has growth potential. But it doesn't have that phenomenon that I just mentioned that really we do well. So that's why we say, we think that company will be better owned by others; a good company, but one that doesn't cater to our needs. We tend to see other people in our space go into those kinds of businesses. But we just don't do well and it doesn't really work for us to be in these lower margin consultancy type businesses. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it; makes sense. And then just a quick follow-up around the capital return dynamic. You guys have talked about in the past running with probably a little bit higher leverage than you targeted in the past prior to the IDC deal. Maybe an update there? What's the debt to EBITDA ratios we should be thinking about on a go forward basis as we try to kind of think through the buyback over the next year or so? Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yeah, so you're right. Historically, we had talked about 1.5 times and we've more recently talked about the need to get below 2 times. And that remains the objective. We are on a path to do that. That's why we were able to get back into the market in October and take advantage of what Jeff correctly identified as the best buy in the market, in our opinion. So, we definitely are on a path to get below 2 times. We're committed to get there. But, as I said in my prepared remarks, not only were we able to restart our buybacks in October, but we remain committed to grow our dividend as we grow. And I think with the increased cash generation that you're seeing, we're going to be north of $2 billion of operating cash flow this year, well north of probably $1.7 billion of free cash flow this year, and that should definitely allow us to get our leverage back below 2 times, to continue to ramp up our share repurchases, because we certainly aren't at the level in the fourth quarter that we would anticipate being as we move through next year, and then also to grow the dividend as we grow. All of which would hopefully move us, in 2014 and 2015 we returned almost $1 billion a year. This year it will be between $400 million and $500 million. But I certain think as you get into 2017 and certainly 2018 and 2019, you're going to see us get back to and above the levels you saw in 2014 and 2015. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Very helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, our next question will come from Vincent Hung of Autonomous. Please go ahead with your question. Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP : Hi. Good morning. Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Good morning. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Good morning. Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP : Just on pricing in the data business, is it possible to break out the different pricing schemes in terms of how much is enterprise based pricing versus per usage versus per head? And actually as a related question, do you feel you've fully utilized the opportunity in exchange data when it comes to finding new ways to price the data, which is pricing certain data sets differently or different pricing schemes for different customers? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Well, to answer the first part of your question is it, we haven't looked at the data in the way you just described. In fact, we're \u2013 part of the exercise that's going on as we're creating ICE Data Services is just for management to figure out the metrics that we're going to use to run the business and honestly it probably won't be as detailed as you just laid out, because there's a lot of moving parts. Particularly given the second part of your question, which is we do see the opportunity because we have a large data set that contains some commoditized data, some proprietary data, some network infrastructure and some desktop space, some indices and some calculation engines, to do sort of package deals, enterprise package deals for people and there's tremendous interest in that. People can come do those deals directly with us. They don't have to have a middleman. And we can provide a range of services. So we've been very successful early on in the ETF/ETP space, where there's a lot of cost pressure on those competitors and yet they need a full range of services from listing the ETF, to calculating the ETF, to having daily prices of the things that are in the ETF to creating the index for the ETF and using our brands and marketing the ETF. So those kinds of package deals don't lend themselves to some of the metrics that you just described. So I doubt that we'll ever fully get to that. Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP : Okay. And what's the guidance on synergies for next year? And is there a figure for any cost synergies from the S&P business you acquired? Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: So we gave you updated guidance on the synergies for this year at $115 million. I'm very encouraged by the work that Ben Jackson and Lynn Martin have been doing on the integrated -- in a much bigger team in support of them to get that business integrated. I think we have good visibility into where we are this year, growing visibility into where we'll be next year and on the fourth quarter earnings call in February, I will definitely give you an update on our overall synergy progress as we work to take out the remaining kind of $105 million to $110 million we have to go overall. Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP : Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Jeff Sprecher for any closing remarks. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Thank you, Allison. And thank you everybody for joining us today. We'll look forward to updating you on our progress as we move through the balance of the year. So have a good morning. Thank you. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Intercontinental Exchange Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kelly Loeffler, Senior Vice President. Please go ahead. Kelly Loeffler - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Good morning. ICE's fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of theice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2016 Form 10-K, which we filed this morning. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including adjusted income, operating margin, expenses, EPS, EBITDA and tax rate. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP term in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful, as well as how management uses these measures. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted continuing operations earnings per share. Unless otherwise noted, the year-over-year figures we will discuss reflect comparisons against adjusted pro forma 2015 results. With us on the call are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and Chief Executive; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Chuck Vice, President and Chief Operating Officer. I'll now turn over the call to Jeff. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Thank you, Kelly. Good morning everybody on the call. We're pleased to have the opportunity to report the best year in ICE's history. As you can see on slide 4, 2016 was our 11th consecutive year of record revenue and record adjusted earnings. It was also our third consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings growth driven by our core business and the strong contributions from investments in our strategic growth initiatives over the last three years. Over that time, we've restructured and integrated NYSE Euronext, while delivering $530 million in synergies to-date. We're ahead of schedule on integrating Interactive Data Corporation with $70 million in synergies delivered in the first year. And we're now increasing our synergy forecasts for the next couple of years. As we integrated the NYSE and IDC, we delivered consistent top line growth, margin expansion and improving returns on invested capital, while also returning more than $2 billion in capital through dividends and share repurchases. We now possess the most comprehensive range of financial market solutions across trading, clearing, and data. Moving into 2017, we remain laser focused on creating value for our shareholders. We continue to skate where the puck is going just as we did when electronic trading and clearing emerged as new areas of growth a decade ago. Over the past five years, we've repositioned our company deeper into areas where growth is more sustainable and revenues are increasingly consistent. Since 2011, we've grown recurring revenues from 9% of our consolidated revenues to 53% in 2016. In the process, we've built modern data solutions by organizing our proprietary data, technology and acquisitions. Our approach leverages the global distribution of our exchanges, clearing houses and our proprietary data, which is an indispensable, growing component of our market participants' workflow. Our strategy continues to prove itself out with double-digit adjusted earnings growth, driven by each of our business segments. ICE Data Services demonstrated its ability to grow above the sector growth rate, while delivering leading operating margins. Our Financial Futures volumes grew double-digit in 2016. And ICE Brent Crude achieved the 20th consecutive year of record volumes. These are just a few of the great examples of drivers of our long-term growth, which provide the foundation of our confidence entering into 2017. I'll now turn the call over to Scott to review our 2016 performance and then I'll be back to discuss our strategy heading into this new year. Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning to everyone. As you can see on slide 5, we delivered a strong finish to a very successful 2016 despite a challenging environment. Fourth quarter revenues of $1.1 billion were up 5% year-over-year or up 7% on a constant currency basis. We will refer to revenue growth on a constant currency basis due to the significant decline in both the pound and the euro reflected in fourth quarter and current spot exchange rates. Adjusted operating expenses in the quarter were $493 million, down 3% year to year and below the midpoint of our guidance by roughly $10 million due to currency impacts and additional synergies. Adjusted operating margins increased 4 points to 57% and adjusted earnings per share grew 11% to $0.71 on a pro forma basis. Moving next to slide 6, revenue growth in the fourth quarter was driven primarily by our data and listings segment where revenues were up 11% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Data and listings revenues grew 6% on a constant currency basis when you exclude the acquisition of the Securities Evaluation and CMA businesses. Notably, recurring revenues were 54% of consolidated revenue in the fourth quarter. And you'll also see that margins in this segment expanded to 52% in the fourth quarter. Within the data and listings segment, pricing and analytics revenue was up 14% year-over-year or 4% on a constant currency basis and excluding the businesses acquired from S&P. We continue to benefit from solid customer retention and are starting to see improvements from the reorganization of our data sales force and continued product development. Exchange data revenue grew 12% over the prior fourth quarter as we continue to see growing customer demand for this important risk management tool. Finally, revenue in our desktop and connectivity business increased 7% year-to-year on a constant currency basis, as more customers chose to buy larger ports to consume increasing amounts of the data that we provide. Turning now to slide seven, our trading and clearing segment revenues were up 3% year-to-year on a constant currency basis, driven by 10% volume growth. Energy revenues grew 9% on a 12% increase in ADV. Our financial revenues declined year-over-year due largely to currency impact and despite 9% growth in interest rate ADV. Operating margin in the trading and clearing business expanded by four points to 63%. Open interest in Brent, WTI, European natural gas and our agriculture and equity index products all reached record open interest levels in 2016. We expect continued geopolitical and market volatility to cause our commercial customers to carefully manage the risks associated with their open positions as we move through 2017. However, volume this January was down compared to the prior year trading volumes that were driven by the extreme volatility in January of 2016. Next, on slide eight, I'll recap our full year results. Consolidated net revenues were $4.5 billion, up 4% over the prior year or up 6% on a constant currency basis. Trading and clearing revenues grew 2% or 4% on a constant currency basis. Data and listings revenues grew 7% with the addition of revenues from the Securities Evaluation acquisition effectively offset by currency impacts. In addition to growing the top line, we delivered synergies of $120 million, $50 million more than we anticipated at the beginning of 2016, which contributed to adjusted operating margins expanding by four points. The combination of revenue growth and expense discipline drove adjusted earnings growth of 11% versus 2015. Importantly, these strong profit results generated record operating cash flows of $2.1 billion, which allowed us to increase our dividend payments by 24% comparing to 2015, even as we reduced our leverage from 2.8 times at the end of 2015 to 2.2 times at the end of 2016. I'd like to take a moment to expand on our approach to capital allocation on slide nine. Our capital allocation philosophy is straightforward. After reinvesting in our business and funding select, strategic growth investments, we balance our investment grade rating with the return of 100% of our excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. One year after acquiring the NYSE, we returned nearly $1 billion per year in both 2014 and 2015. Similarly, one year after acquiring IDC, we expect to return over $1 billion in 2017. Underpinning this growth in capital returns, this morning, we announced an 18% increase in our quarterly dividend. We have now raised our dividend by double digits every year since we instituted it, which is consistent with our commitment to grow the dividend as we grow. We also plan to increase our share repurchase activity from $50 million in the fourth quarter to $200 million in the first quarter. We expect to continue to use repurchases as a primary means of returning an increased amount of capital to our shareholders during 2017. Our confidence in the strength of our business model and the sustainability of our cash flow enables us to invest in our business, maintain our solid investment grade rating, and significantly increase our capital returns only one year post the acquisition of IDC. Please turn to slide 10, which highlights our track record of delivering sector leading and consistently improving returns on invested capital. We have a disciplined process around M&A analysis and integration. We look to strengthen the companies we acquire by integrating them closely into ICE's operations to unlock greater value over the long term. Our process measures each business case against our goal of delivering double-digit returns on invested capital; meaning that returns generated are expected to be well above our cost of capital. While each business case is constructed with a view to creating long-term value, the foundation of success is established in our growth, integration and synergy plans which create positive returns above our cost of capital in the near-term. I should also point out that we consistently evaluate our portfolio. If a business no longer fits our strategy or is not helping us meet our ROIC target, we will divest that business. We did it with Euronext and with NYSE Technologies and expect to divest IDMS during the first quarter and NYSE Governance Services later this year. While good businesses in their own right, they don't meaningfully leverage ICE's core competency or have our strong margin expansion profile. The results of this disciplined process are reflected on this slide. ROIC has consistently improved in the three years since we acquired NYSE. We expect to deliver a similar trend of improvement as we execute the integration of our recently acquired data businesses. Finally, it's worth noting that our approach has enabled us to deliver nearly 140% total shareholder return to any ICE shareholder who has held our shares since December of 2012, almost double the return of the S&P 500 over that same period. I'll conclude my remarks on slide 11 by highlighting a few key elements of our 2017 guidance. Please refer to our press release and presentation for a complete summary of our guidance. Entering 2017, data revenues under contract are 8% higher than they were entering 2016, which gives us confidence that our data business can grow once again, at least 6% on a constant currency basis. While the various acquisitions and divestments we have completed or expect to complete during the first quarter will end \u2013 impact individual data revenue categories, the net impact to our overall data revenues and expenses is expected to be immaterial. I also want to note that while we don't provide guidance for our trading and clearing segment, we are encouraged by open interest levels, strong commercial participation, new products and anticipated market volatility in 2017. Finally, I want to summarize our expectation for expenses entering 2017. We exited 2016 with around $100 million in synergies to go. We now expect to realize an additional $25 million to $30 million across our acquired data businesses. We expect to deliver roughly $60 million in synergies during 2017. Adjusted expenses are also expected to decline by around $30 million at current spot currency rates. The net impact to 2017 of the fourth quarter acquisition of the Securities Evaluation and CMA businesses along with the small data acquisition and the divestment of IDMS, which we expect to occur in the first quarter, will increase expenses by $8 million to $10 million. These additional expenses will be more than offset by incremental revenues of $12 million to $14 million. We also expect growth in variable expenses related to increased data revenues, additional investments in the resiliency and security of our broad technology footprint and increased compensation expenses as we bring IDC onto our ICE structure and as we reward our team for their consistently strong execution each consistent with our pay-for-performance culture. The net of all these ins and outs is that we expect our expenses to be roughly flat in 2017 versus 2016. I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A, but for now, I'll hand the call back to Jeff. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Thank you, Scott. As we look ahead to 2017, you can see we've continued to build a consistent growth and leading return oriented business. We're bringing the global distribution of 12 exchanges and 6 clearing houses together with data and information, which is the lifeblood of markets and risk management. On slide 12, you can see that we've grown every year by executing on our growth strategies, staying nimble and maintaining a focus on the needs of our customers. Our customers provide the best and deepest insights into evolving market needs. And this focus has enabled us to steer into high value areas of global markets. We believe this is why ICE stands apart over the long-term. It's the basis for our consistent growth regardless of economic or market conditions, as you can see here. Our work is well underway to drive growth and returns in 2017. Whether it's offering new products, realizing our synergies, integrating our acquired businesses or repaying debt and return in capital, we will continue to deliver on our objectives. As we achieve further synergies and expand our margins, we also expect to grow our revenues with a range of initiatives across markets, listings, data and clearing. With the majority of our revenues becoming more recurring, we believe this will strengthen our future performance and provide us with more visibility to manage the growth of our top line, earnings and cash flow. It also provides for more consistency in capital return. Notably, this consistency is driven by several of our more recent acquisitions. We have $950 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization and we expect to be active in acquiring our shares this year. So we're delivering on our philosophy of growing our cash flow to reinvest in our business, pay a growing dividend and repurchase shares based on intrinsic value. We'll continue to balance this with a prudent M&A that has generated these strong returns. I expect that any such M&A focus will be towards smaller complementary transactions rather than the larger deals of past years, given our confidence in the growth platform that we have today. If you turn to slide 13, you can see there are many drivers of our confidence regardless of the financial or regulatory environment in which we operate. First, you might ask how ICE's data business can be growing at a rate faster than the sector average. The simple answer is that we are building a high-value data business that is able to serve the requirements of traders, asset managers, corporates, banks and regulators. This focus is particularly important as the demand for data has continued to evolve rapidly, following the financial crisis and the growing digitization of commerce. What we've assembled at ICE is a global data business based on comprehensive proprietary data that supports analytics, desktops, indices, data connectivity and benchmarks. For example, ICE generates packages and can sell data directly from our 12 exchanges, without the overhead of re-distributor costs. Our exchanges provide valuable data inputs into indices, like our recent announcement with S&P Global Platts, who will utilize natural gas data from ICE markets, for their benchmark indices in North America. We also have services to provide the feeds, the connectivity and the proximity hosting for this data. So that's an example of our ability to provide unique end-to-end solutions. In the vast and growing fixed income markets, we're a leader in the evaluated pricing of bonds and a leading innovator in real-time pricing tools, as you've seen in our recent announcements with our continuous evaluated pricing being integrated into BlackRock's Aladdin. And ICE Benchmark Administration was named to a key role within the ISDA Credit Determinations Committee, as it continues to add to its positioning as a neutral regulated benchmark administrator. Our customers' compliance requirements continue to grow. We offer a range of solutions whether it's our liquidity indicators and reference data bundle or our best execution solutions. We're solving for our customer needs across Basel III, MiFID II, EMIR, Dodd-Frank, Solvency II, FRTB and other regulatory mandates. These are a few examples of our data capabilities and how ICE continues to be woven into the fabric of global markets. We continue to build on our proprietary data solutions as there are many dynamics supporting the need for more data. As you can see on the slide, we are very well-positioned to serve. Let me shift to our listings business. Having taken ICE public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2005, I'm really proud of what we've been able to achieve at the NYSE in the three years that we've owned it. We've delivered on our cost synergies while dramatically growing the business and ensuring that it is the global listings leader for corporate and ETF issuers. It was a declining business and we've reversed it, strengthened the floor, conducted 26 out of the last 26 large U.S. IPOs, turned around the financial performance, changed the culture and expanded its opportunity set. NYSE continues to be a source of growth for listings and data revenue and this can be attributed to our disciplined integration efforts that Scott described which unlock value across our acquired companies. In that regard, on the right side of the slide, you can see that we're focused on several areas to build on the solid performance of our transaction business, which creates the virtuous cycle of growth when coupled with our data operations. We offer a full range of risk management and trading solutions across virtually all asset classes. And our clearing houses continue to provide growth opportunities from clearing new products to serving the demand for risk management services. We've built out the broadest energy markets available today, both geographically and from a product perspective. ICE's exchanges in the U.S., the UK, Europe and Asia all serve the global energy markets on a common trading and clearing platform around the clock as trading shifts from east to west during the day. In European interest rates, we've had great volumes last year growing 12%. What 2017 holds for volumes is difficult to predict, but we believe that Central Bank actions and geopolitics will again dictate that for the most part. This business accounted for roughly 4% of our total revenues and we remain the leading European short-term interest rate franchise, even in this low interest environment. We believe that there remains strong volume upside as Europe recovers. We continue to see opportunities to strengthen the NYSE's trading position by evolving our market structure and expanding trading in all U.S. equities through our hybrid floor based model later in 2017. I'll close my remarks on slide 14, noting that we're committed to building on the track record of growth that you can see here. Not only is it unsurpassed in our sector regardless of financial or economic environments, but it serves as a guidepost to our team to continue to deliver results to our customers and to our shareholders. Our strategy to serve our customers where they are located and our ability to evolve our business quickly to serve the highest value parts of global markets requires us to remain nimble, responsive and results oriented. Because, we're not levered to a single cyclical trend or geography, we've lead our space in growth on virtually every metric over the last decade. I want to thank our customers for their partnership and I want to thank my fellow employees for their dedicated efforts in achieving these results. I'm now turning the call back over to Andrew, our moderator, and he'll conduct a question-and-answer session until 9 :30 AM Eastern Time. Andrew? Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Michael Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Thanks, guys. Hey, Scott, just a question on some of the guidance, just \u2013 and particularly, just on the capital and the cash used. Just wanted to get a sense, when you look at, say, the $1 billion that you're looking at to return to shareholders and then if we look at your cash flow, there's obviously the other $1 billion-plus, what's the pace of maybe debt pay-down this year versus, you mentioned, smaller deals, if they come up, in order to see, if you have that like flexibility. And then, just one other one on the cash side is just when we look at the share count, it looks somewhat like flattish despite the buybacks. So, just any indication on grants that would be kicking in to somewhat offset the buybacks. Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yeah. So, Mike, thanks for the question. There's a lot tied up in that and if I miss a part, let me know. So, let me start on the last question. The share guidance reflects only those repurchases that we would expect in the first quarter, the $200 million that we talked about on the call. We don't project our forward repurchases and therefore we don't project it in the share count. So that maybe why you're seeing the share count be relatively flat offset with the grants, as you talked about it. More importantly, in the script, I want to be really clear about this. What I said was return over $1 billion this year, not $1 billion. And so, you're going at the right starting point. So, even if you just assume similar cash flows to what we had in 2016 and the timing of certain cash flows can vary back and forth; that was over $2 billion. If you net out of that CapEx, you're looking at free cash flow of $1.8 billion. We talked about $475 million of dividends with the increase that we put in. We're probably about $400 million give or take a little bit of debt reduction to get to our leverage target. That leaves us substantial amount of money for share repurchases. And Jeff was very clear, we've got a $950 million authorization. We've come out strongly in the first quarter with $200 million and I said explicitly that it's our intent to return 100% of our free cash flow that we don't need for investments in the business or dividends to our shareholders and that'll likely come through repurchases. So, I think the expectation for this year should be a very strong capital return and frankly the most capital we've returned in the history of the company. Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. No, that makes sense. And then just real quick on the taxes. Just given the change in equity comp accounting, just any impact there? I am sure it's in your guidance for the full year, but just wanted to get any color. Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yeah. It was actually in our numbers for 2016. If you looked at our Qs and Ks, we had disclosed that as we moved through the year. There're a couple things that I think are important to note there. Number one, the impact to your tax rate depends on the size of your pre-tax profit, and ours is significantly larger and so the impact from that change is a bit smaller, number one. Number two, be really careful because that is a presentation change. It has nothing to do with cash. And so, again, net-net, it's reflected in our tax rate in 2016, it's reflected in our guidance in 2017. It's a relatively smaller impact for us because of the size of the pre-tax profit we generate. Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Makes sense. Thanks a lot. Operator : The next question comes from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Yeah. Good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Scott. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Good morning. Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Morning. Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : I guess, first, my question, I think I know the answer, but on the market data revenue guidance, so you're netting out, I guess, the impact of the CMA and S&P, I mean SPSA (sic) [SPSE] (27:37), against the website business that you sold. And could you give us any sort of the revenues of that business that was sold? Because \u2013 okay, go ahead. Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yup. It's a good question, Rich. So you're exactly right. So, the guidance is net of the acquisition of the S&P businesses in the fourth quarter, the divestment of IDMS, which we expect to close in the first quarter and a smaller data acquisition that we also expect to include in the first quarter. You net all of that out and it's roughly a wash. I said $12 million to $14 million of incremental revenue, which on a $2 billion database (sic) [revenue base] (28:11) is nothing. And so, the guidance of at least 6% growth nets all that in. Importantly, when the IDMS business closes and that new smaller data acquisition closes in the first quarter, you will see a reduction in revenues in the second, third and fourth quarter of about $12 million each per quarter. And associated with that is a reduction in expenses of about $10 million per quarter. So you get a sense of the margin profile of the business being divested and our comments on the script about evaluating our portfolio. So that is all netted in the expectation and again, at least 6% is on a constant currency basis. Currency right now looks like it's about 1.5 to 2-point hurt in 2017 versus 2016, if current spot rates hold. Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And Jeff, I guess, broader question is we definitely seen a different outlook in regards to regulation, at least here in the U.S. And I think, I'm not sure how you position regulation as being at least somewhat of a burden in Europe to cause fragment \u2013 that will cause fragmentation, but also as a benefit as well. And I guess, if you could just sort of give your views on the potential for change in regulation in the U.S., whether it be Dodd-Frank or Volcker. And then an update on what's going on in Europe. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Sure. While, I think, you used the word in your question which is we expect there's going to be change and whenever there's change it means that customers are having to change their behavior and modify their risk management practices. And we always do really well in these environments of change because we're pretty nimble and responsive and we have a pretty big toolkit. So, we do all of that as positive from a business environment standpoint and it validates the decisions we made long ago to have a jurisdiction placement in different jurisdictions of key people and key assets so that we can be pretty locally responsive and on top of those things. That being said, you do see this trend in the U.S. towards lighter touch regulation and you're going to have some kind of change going on in Europe post Brexit with the UK leaving the EU and both entities revaluating, in my opinion, the footprints of regulation that they have in order to remain globally competitive and have something that's relevant to their markets. So, a lot going on. It's why Scott is relatively confident that we begin the year with our data revenues up 8% contracted compared to last year. And a lot of that business has come from EMEA as people are positioning themselves really due to regulatory changes that are going on over there. Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay. Very helpful. I'll get back in the queue. Thanks. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks. Thanks, guys. Good morning. So, just sticking with the data business for a second. Following up, Jeff, on your last point about contracts being up 8% versus the prior year; can you give us a sense on, I guess, like how predictive is this for revenue growth in this business? I know you only had it for about a year, but just given the trends that you saw in 2016, wondering how good of an indicator that is for revenue growth. And then maybe you could expand on particular products and categories that you're seeing a pickup of growth within that 8%. Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yeah, it's good question. And we have back tested, if you will, the metric a bit and it's a good indicator. It's not a perfect indicator, nothing is, because as you move through the year, you look at new sales and what the trends are there, the mix of products that are being sold, et cetera, but it is a good indicator that's why I mentioned it. I think our confidence in our data business growing is supported by the metric, that metric being up 8% entering the year. And by the way, that up 8% is on an apples to apples constant currency basis, so it directly relates to the revenue growth. I think it's relatively more indicative of, if you will, the former IDC business. And I think it's important to note that that business, which is largely reflected in our pricing and analytics, we expect to grow two times faster this year than it did last year. And so, while the overall growth is at least 6%, the leader of that growth this year is going to be that pricing and analytics business. It's going to be for the reasons that Jeff talked about, with particular strength in Europe, with particular demand for more information around bond pricing, et cetera. And so, overall, my expectation, as opposed to this year, where exchange data was the faster growing segment, exchange data will be a solid contributor once again in 2017. But it's really that pricing and analytics business that will grow faster than the overall data revenues. And then it's going to be a bit of a mixed bag in connectivity and desktops as we move through the year. Connectivity, as I said, we're seeing more and more customers want more and more of our data and move up to larger ports, which is obviously going to generate revenue growth in connectivity. But, in desktops, that's where the IDMS business is, that business will be coming out in the second through the fourth quarter. And so, as you look at the year-over-year dynamics of that, it won't look particularly appealing, but again, that will be largely reflective of the divestment. So, hopefully that gives you a little bit of a flavor for the pieces underneath the total. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. That's very helpful. And then just a quick clarification around expenses. Scott, I think I heard you say that FX on a spot basis is a bit of a headwind still to the guidance on the data side. But presumably that would also help on the expense side of the equation. So, I guess, within the guidance that you provided on adjusted expenses, what are you assuming for FX? And if you were to kind of think about the spot rates, what could that look like? Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yeah, we actually put that explicitly on chart 11, so it's a $30 million benefit in our expenses just parceled through the year. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : The next question comes from Warren Gardiner of Evercore. Please go ahead. Warren Gardiner - Evercore Group LLC : Yeah. Great. Thanks. I was just wondering if you guys could maybe talk about the reference data business a bit. I mean, I think you guys announced that APEX was going to be providing some services to GoldenSource during the quarter. So can you just maybe speak to that opportunity and what you see there going forward? I think it's kind of an area that IDC invested in and was also kind of a \u2013 maybe a smaller player versus some of the incumbents. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Sure. Well, first of all, let me just say that it's \u2013 we're in the reference data business, particularly strong, in certain segments of the reference data business around the fixed income platform. We're looking across our whole organization. The acquisition of Interactive Data Corporation sort of a light went on inside the company to say, boy, we have all kinds of reference data around here that we never really thought about digitizing. So we are investing this year and part of Scott's guidance is continued investment in the digitization of reference data so that we can make it available through the connectivity and the distribution channels that we have. So it's a very good and strong area for us and one that we feel like has growth opportunities. Customers increasingly want lots of choice in how they gather data. They oftentimes want multiple providers. And they want as much information as they can put on the digital highway so that it's easy for them to consume it. So, all of those trends are things that has caused us to up our investment in that area. Warren Gardiner - Evercore Group LLC : Great. Thanks. That was it. That's it for me. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Can you talk about the cash equity and equity options business? There seems to be some pricing pressure in the industry, it's kind of affecting share of a lot of the participants. I guess, maybe, how are you managing that balance between continued profitability and market share? Thanks. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Sure. Let me start with the second part first, the equity options business. ICE is in almost every asset class in some manner around the world. And I would say to you that the U.S. equity options business is the most difficult business of any business that we're in. We're in it because it's part of the NYSE and all the other good things that we derive out of the NYSE. But that as a standalone business is incredibly challenged. If you look last year, there were new market participants come in as exchanges to list equity options. And the rate per contract fell as a result of that and volumes across the industry fell. So, in that environment, you have one or two choices, you can play a market share game and cut fees in order to talk about market share or you can try to maximize your business towards earnings potential and that's what we're doing, is the latter. We don't really care about share, we really care about finding our core group of customers that like what we do and the way we deliver it and it's the technology we have and are willing to pay us appropriately for it. And I let all that other noise just drift away and \u2013 to be very honest with you, Ken. The market has, at its core, a small handful of market makers that are very, very important to this country and to those markets, but those people are very sophisticated, they can move their business around that will, they use algorithms to maximize their profitability. And so, you've got to attack that market in a way that defines your business and as you can see, consistent through the presentation today, we're really looking for earnings per share growth long-term for our shareholders. So that is that business. The equities business is interesting to us and we're doing quite well in that business. We \u2013 when we look at the business today, there are a number of business models that exist. We believe the best model is the NYSE model of a hybrid floor and screen coupled with dedicated market makers. And the market also believes that is the best model and that particular model has the highest market share in the U.S. equity space. But there are customers that want choice and so, we have decided and announced earlier that we're going to you \u2013 we're going to list the other models if you will under the different medallions that we have and that is an all electronic model, which is very good for ETFs and ETF listings, a speed bump model. And we've got one other medallion we haven't announced yet what we're going to do there, but suffice to say that's our goal for customers to have a one-stop shop where they can get all the different models in one place at a very low cost with very good technology. And so, we'll look forward to delivering that. We're highly optimistic about our ability to grow earnings on the NYSE as a result of the investments that we're making there. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. And then, Scott, maybe really a quickie. Cost synergies coming in faster than you expected. You signed an additional $25 million to $30 million. You're guiding to $60 million now for 2017. I haven't been able to navigate the math yet. What does this imply for 2018? How much is left there? Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: So, Ken with the additional $25 million to $30 million that kind of leaves us toway I would think about it is we're going to get little less than half this year, and then, the rest of it in 2018 and 2019. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Allen of Buckingham. Please go ahead. Chris Allen - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Just want to talk about the trading businesses a little bit. I think, Jeff, just kind of covered equity options and cash equities and you talked in your remarks about potential growth opportunities elsewhere. I just wonder if you could kind of point to any specific examples maybe within the asset classes. Some of your competitors obviously have very specific things to talk about, some are more successful than others related to revenues and/or volumes. So, I just wonder if you could give us any specific areas whether its energy, agricultural rates that you think there's potential opportunities moving forward? Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Hey, Chris, let me start, if you don't mind, just with a few data points. Look, as Jeff said, we have never tried to predict volatility and we're not going to predict it this year. But our open interest level for our total oil business was at a record-level at the end of 2016. And underneath the covers, our WTI business, record-level; our Brent business, barely off record-level; European natural gas open interest, record-levels; our agriculture and metals business, record-level open interest; our equity indices business, which grew really well in 2016, record open interest level. So, when I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we don't predict our trading and clearing revenues because we can't predict volatility, we feel good about where we are from an open interest standpoint. A lot of point talk about their volume growth and that's interesting, but not really relevant. What matters is where are your open interest levels, how much of your participation is commercial participants, what are you doing in terms of delivering new products to those customers. And if we look at the combination of those things, if there's a little bit of volatility, we'll grow a little bit, if there's a lot of volatility, we'll see some solid growth. So we feel good about the metrics, we're just not looking to predict volatility. Chris Allen - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Got it. I was looking maybe for new product development opportunities, things like that. I totally understand the whole volatility outlook. Maybe just a different question on market data. I mean, maybe what are you guys seeing in terms of new customer trends? And \u2013 I mean obviously you talked a bit historically about opportunities to get deeper within your current existing customers on the IDC side and ICE side. But are you seeing any new customers coming to you for market data products and/or a new growth avenues there? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Sure. Well, first of all, let me just reiterate what I think you recognized, which is ICE had a business historically that came \u2013 the exhaustive (43:35) of a trading that was very targeted towards traders and the front office. And IDC had a business that was providing settlement prices that was very targeted towards the back office. And the combination of the sales force and what we're doing with the marketing effort is to be able to sell to the front, middle and back office across the broad array of products. So, if you talk to people in our commodity data business, they're seeing new customers, if you will, which are really the middle and back office of traditional IDC customers. So there's a commingling, if you will, of accounts that is going on and that's driving a lot growth that we see as a lot of our customers want to have a one-stop shop. I mentioned that, separately, we're seeing a lot of growth in EMEA as people are getting ready for MiFID II as the Basel rules are kicking in and as changes are going on with Brexit and the regulatory structure, particularly in Europe. That's spilling over somewhat now into Asia. We're seeing \u2013 we have offices \u2013 sales offices in Asia. They're able to take a lot of these products that we're building and adapt them for Asia. And we're making some investments there that we think are going to pay longer term dividends. And last year, we really saw the customer growth was in our historical energy commodity information which really grew a lot. That is still continuing to grow. There's some spillover coming out of last year as a lot of new customers are buying our data given that the market is becoming fragmented due to both competition and regulation and is driving the need for information. So, all of that is underneath the metrics that give us some confidence that this data business that we've been investing in is going to be a growth engine for us for a number of years. Chris Allen - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thanks, guys. Operator : The next question comes from Vincent Hung of Autonomous. Please go ahead. Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP : Hi. Can you talk about the Wells Notice that you called out in the 10-K this morning? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Sure. Well, it relates to an outage that the New York Stock Exchange had on July 8th of 2015. And that outage was as a result of a failed upgrade of software and a latent bug that was discovered as a result of that process. We hold ourselves and NYSE holds itself to really high standards of business practice. And during that process, was providing a lot of timely and accurate communication as to what was going on in that market and was attempting to alert the market to the technical issues as they were being identified, which we have a regulatory obligation to do. So we dispute the appropriateness that \u2013 of the potential charges that the SEC wants to bring and we have a lot of defenses. And as a result of that, we made our own written submission to the SEC, articulating our points that at the end of the day it was a technology outage, it was very unfortunate, it was embarrassing and a black eye, but we don't believe that it actually violated any law. Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP : Okay. And what would be the impact if the new administration of the SEC repealed Reg (sic) [Regulation] (47:01) NMS? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Well, that's \u2013 we'll have \u2013 let's sit down and talk about that over dinner. I think the trend from what is being discussed at least is a lighter touch form of regulation. We'll see how that actually gets promulgated. But I would tell you that almost anything that we do around the New York Stock Exchange requires a rule change and requires a approval by the SEC. So, right now, we are operating in a very, very highly regulated somewhat restrictive business. So we would welcome the freedom to innovate and to do some \u2013 use some of the techniques and technology and things that we do in other markets and bring them into the U.S. equity space. So I'm thinking at least the rhetoric right now is quite positive towards the way we do business. Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks, guys. A question on the outlook for data. It sounds qualitatively like there's a lot of good things going on. But when I look at the guidance, up 6%. It's down slightly from the prior guidance, I believe, which was 6% to 7%. But I know you've got moving parts in there, we've got FX and there's some divestitures going on. So can you help us? Is the guidance should we be thinking about essentially as an affirmation of where we were before, or should we be thinking about it in a different way? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: I think you ought to be thinking about it as an affirmation of what we think's a terrific business. What we've said before \u2013 let's be really precise. What I said on the last call was we would grow at similar levels as we moved in 2017 as we delivered in 2016. I now said at least 6%. Underneath the covers, I noted that the pricing and analytics business, which is mostly our former IDC business, is going to grow faster than that and twice as fast as it did in 2016. I noted that in desktop, there'll be some erosion because of the IDMS sale. So we feel pretty good and feel like we're affirming what we've said before and hope that it's not lost on people that it's a business that's going to grow at least 6%. It's delivering 52% operating margin, which just doesn't exist in the data space. So it's a business that's growing quickly and a business that is generating very strong operating margin and it's one of the reasons why we're confident in saying we're going to return record levels of capital to shareholders this year. So, again, our view is it's an affirmation of a great business that's fully integrated and growing. Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Understood. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thanks and good morning, guys. Sorry, Scott, just one more on the data side, just to maybe walk through the $12 million to $14 million that you talked about per quarter. So, let me just back up, I guess, so the 6% data guide, if we apply the currencies and I think you're using \u2013 tell me if you're using year-end or the current currency rates and that I think would knock it down like 1.5 point or so. So we're looking at sort of an actual 4% to 5% growth in the data. And then, you talked about the divestitures. Maybe you can just \u2013 that 4% to 5% includes the divestitures, is that correct? Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: The 5% that we put in the guidance includes everything. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: The at least 6% on constant currency includes everything. And again, I feel like we're missing the forest for the tree. This is a really good business where we've said historically we would grow similarly to what we did last year. We grew 6% to 7% last year. We're going to grow 6% this year. We're going to generate 52% operating margin and the pricing and analytics business, it's going to grow twice as fast as it did in 2016. This is a great business. And again, don't lose sight of the fact that I said at least 6%. And so that means we likely think more than 6%; similar to 6% to 7% meaning likely more than 6%. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. And I definitely agree that trends are \u2013 seems (51:30) just trying to actually get the numbers. And then maybe if you can talk a little bit about the exchange data component of this? And I know, Jeff, you alluded to competition from NASDAQ and FX (51:42) business coming into the markets and that actually helping your ability to monetize that given the expansion of volume coming into futures. I guess, how much of that improvement came from that angle and do you foresee that sort of in perpetuity, I guess? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Well, it's hard to know how to dissect a trend, but we had two things going on; one was that we decided, as a result of the fact that we were the primary market in many markets that anyone that wanted to see the primary market should compensate the people that \u2013 us and essentially the people that are contributing to the primary market. And so, we changed our focus towards making sure that we got those people in our orbit as paying customers. And secondly, there just is this overall trend of people wanting more information. As the market fragments, the back office has to settle the books, what is the price? You've got prices all over the place and somebody has to stand there and say, this is how we're marketing the books, this is where the market is; a trader and a risk manager have to decide what's going on in this market, what is the price that I should buy at. And all of that kind of fragmentation starts to promote the use of algorithms, the front, middle and back office consumption of data. And so, as we've been very transparent with you, we believe that there was going to be a fragmentation trend in the market for years and have been over the last few years setting ourselves up to be in the growth area, the earnings growth area of that market, which is why we positioned the company where we have today and it's why we did well in that space last year. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : And the last question today will come from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Could you guys update us on Trayports (sic) [Trayport] (53:53) and kind of the implications or state of proceedings there? And then, inclusive of your guidance for next year, if we were to strip that out kind of how that may would impact the growth? Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Well, we're in an appeals process around Trayport. So there's no update because we don't know the outcome of that process. As a result of that, I would say to you, it's a business we like. It's a good business and it's doing well. So it is included in our guidance consistent with our appeal that we should be the long-term owner of that business. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeffrey Sprecher, Chairman and CEO, for any closing remarks. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Thank you, Andrew. I just want to thank everybody for joining us today. And Scott and I, Kelly will look forward to updating you on our progress during 2017. Have a good day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Thanks, Kelly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report on our first quarter results which included solid volume and data revenue growth, continued expense discipline and increased capital returns. I'll start this morning on slide four, which lists some highlights from the quarter. Data revenues grew 6% organically versus the prior year on a constant currency basis and increased sequentially from a strong fourth quarter. This reflects the strategic rationale of building out our data operations to capture our customers' increasing demand for information. In our trading and clearing segment, average daily volume or ADV grew 4% and open interest grew 6%. Growth accelerated further in April and on a year-to-date basis both ADV and open interest are now 9% versus a year ago. Though currency and mix are impacting revenue, these volume and OI trends reflect continued demand for the risk management services our global trading and clearing businesses provide. Next, I want to highlight that the NYSE continues to attract world class companies in a very robust IPO environment. Through April, over 85% all capital raised by the IPOs of U.S. operating companies happened on the NYSE, including five IPOs this past Friday. All of this helped us generate cash flows of $611 million which allowed us to return nearly $350 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, the second largest quarterly capital return in our company's history. During the quarter, we also continued to refine our portfolio which will sharpen our strategic focus and generate additional cash to support future investments, capital returns and deleveraging. Finally, I want to note that we look forward to seeing many of you at our Investor Day on June 2 where you will have an opportunity to hear from our extended management team. These individuals have deep expertise in their respective fields and their fingers on the pulse of the business lines they oversee. They will provide an in-depth look at how we are positioned to continue to grow and deliver strong returns for our shareholders. Now let's move to slide five where I'll recap our first quarter consolidated financial results. First quarter revenues of $1.16 billion were up 1% year-to-year and up 3% on a constant currency basis. We will refer to revenue growth on a constant currency basis given the significant impact from the decline in both the pound and the euro on a year-to-year basis. Adjusted operating expenses in the first quarter were $495 million. We remain on track towards our full year expense guidance and expect adjusted expenses in the second quarter between $485 million and $495 million. This includes a net reduction of around $10 million in expenses associated with the IDMS sale and the acquisition of TMX Atrium. Adjusted operating margins in the first quarter were 57%. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.74. Next on slide six, I'll discuss our data and listings segment. These largely recurring revenues comprise 54% of our consolidated revenues in the first quarter. Segment revenues grew 9% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and we expanded operating margin to 52% by delivering on our synergy commitment even as we invest in strategic growth opportunities. Listings revenue grew 2% in the first quarter. More importantly, though, as previously noted, we've had great success in a very robust IPO market through the first four months of this year. And, as you know, these current year wins drive listings revenue growth primarily in the subsequent year and generate revenue across trading and data as well. Speaking of our data business, we had another strong quarter. On an organic constant currency basis, data revenue grew 6% over the prior first quarter. For clarity, we define organic revenue growth to exclude the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures that significantly impact the current period year-over-year comparison. For the first quarter, organic growth excludes the first quarter 2017 revenues from the Securities Evaluations business and CMA. The table on the lower left portion of this slide shows the constant currency growth rates to which I'll refer for each individual business in the right-hand column. Pricing and analytics revenues in constant currency increased 18% year-to-year in the first quarter. On an organic constant currency basis, revenues grew 6%, accelerating from 4% growth in the fourth quarter. We continue to benefit from high customer retention rates, new products, and increased value capture, coupled with a fully integrated sales team cross-selling to existing clients and adding new customers. Next, our exchange data revenues grew 7% over the prior first quarter. We continue to see solid demand for our exchange data product and expect full year growth of between 4% and 5% on top of last year's 14% growth. Finally, revenue in our desktop and connectivity category grew 3% year-to-year, reflecting demand for more capacity to consume our pricing and analytics and exchange data products. I'll pause here to note that with the completion of the sale of IDMS and the acquisition of the TMX Atrium business, we expect desktop and connectivity revenues to be around $12 million lower in each subsequent quarter this year. As you can see, we continue to curate our data business to grow faster than the industry by targeting the areas of greatest customer demand. And, importantly, our annual subscription value, or ASV, entering 2Q is up 6% versus the prior year. Our organic growth and the synergies we are realizing from our acquisition integration will help us continue to deliver expanding and industry-leading operating margins. Please turn to slide seven where I'll review our trading and clearing segment. Revenues were down 4% year-to-year on a constant currency basis. However, in our futures markets, first quarter ADV was up 4% versus a strong first quarter in the prior year. Open interest was up 6% versus the prior first quarter and we set open interest future records in Brent, gas oil, heating oil, UK natural gas, cocoa, and MSCI indices during the quarter. Finally, though equity market trends remain challenging, we have a number of initiatives underway at NYSE to enhance our leadership position, including the strategy we announced in January to diversify our market model and to list more securities on our floor-based markets. Before leaving slide seven, I want to highlight that the second quarter is off to an auspicious start. April ADV rose 26% versus last April. Commodity ADV increased 7% in April, with oil up 12%. Financials ADV grew over 60% year-to-year driven by interest rates. And, importantly, open interest is now up 9% from a year ago, supporting our confidence in the continued demand for our product set and risk management tools. I'll wrap up my remarks on slide eight. We generated over $600 million in operating cash flow during the first quarter. We use these strong cash flows to invest in our business and to return approximately $350 million to shareholders, including $229 million through share repurchases and $120 million through dividends. And, importantly, we recently completed the sale of our Cetip stake and those proceeds will enable us to meet our leverage target while continuing our share repurchases, including nearly $80 million already repurchased this quarter. So, less than 18 months after closing the IDC acquisition we're generating strong data revenue growth, we've accelerated and increased our expense synergies, we've strategically enhanced our business, we've delevered and we've returned nearly $900 million through dividends and share repurchases. And, as we look ahead, we're on track to meet our 2017 objectives for growth, synergies, and integration milestones and capital returns. I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A, but for now I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Thank you, Scott. As you can see, the balance across our transaction and non-transactions segments is complementary, where trading drives data and listings drives trading. This comprehensive model has enabled us to provide a compelling value proposition for customers while steadily growing our cash flow and increasing our capital return. You can see that balance on slide nine with the valuable range of services we provide to support our customers' trading, investing, and risk management activities. We've strategically positioned ICE as the most global exchange operator with half of our profits derived outside the U.S. To achieve this reach, we've built a globally connected network of solutions for our customers, many of whom also operate on a global scale and who rely upon us each day for mission-critical services. Through this network, we deliver a vast range of content that serves our customers across their workflow. We offer a diverse range of products through common technology across our worldwide exchanges and clearinghouses which enables us to scale our offerings into the provision of data services. Because trading, investing and risk management all require an increasing amount of information, we're extremely well positioned to directly serve these growing customer needs. In addition, the predictability of our revenue model is increasing given the growth of our subscription based businesses, which improves our ability to consistently return capital while we invest in growth. Moving to slide 10, we're focused on becoming a global leader in the provision of data services. We've demonstrated our ability to exceed the industry's growth rate by focusing on areas of opportunity as demonstrated by our year-over-year track record of growing data revenues on both an annual and a quarterly basis since 2010. How have we done this? In part, our success is driven by a clear commitment to investing prudently to put the company in a position to benefit from the secular trends for increased data consumption that we've shown you over the last several quarters. In addition, we benefit from the growth of our exchange business coupled with new products, the addition of new customers, selling more to our existing customers and rationalizing our pricing across our wide range of solutions. This helps to ensure that we're highly competitive and contributing to earnings growth. Our experience in operating exchanges gave us firsthand knowledge that data is an increasingly valuable part of the service that exchanges provide. In addition, with our roots in the over the counter markets and in clearing, we saw that analytics, indices and valuation services were becoming increasingly important products. We made some of our first investments in indices and valuation capabilities well over a decade ago, and we've continued to build on these. So, when we saw the opportunity to acquire Interactive Data, it was a rare opportunity to gain a foothold into an established set of proprietary data products and gain a dedicated sales force. We believe that the market for data will continue to grow due to automation, regulation and increased risk management. Each of these requires more data to inform these activities. We're seeing a customer shift towards taking data via direct feeds and powering targeted applications with more flexible pricing packages as customers move away from traditional multi-asset class desktops. That fits our approach to providing data solution given our vast array of proprietary data that we can bundle and sell directly. I think that we're lining up very well to meet the demand and I'm pleased with our rapid progress in becoming a more effective and capable supplier. Turning to slide 11, you can see that our global presence drives results for each part of our business. Last Friday we extended our very clear lead in capital raising with five IPOs taking place on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on that single day. Our global leadership with the NYSE listings franchise is part of a concerted effort that we've made over the last three years since acquiring the business. Our team is focusing on providing the best service, value, and market access. As a result, NYSE has listed the vast majority of significant companies going public this year, including large tech IPOs. And that track record extends back to nearly every major IPO over the last couple of years, including the IPOs for Snap, Yext and Canada Goose, for example, during the first quarter. We recently rolled out our new NYSE Connect platform based on ICE's data and technology that we adopted from our other businesses. We're able to offer this platform to our listed companies at no charge in contrast to other exchanges where corporate solutions is a revenue line. NYSE is known for its proven market model, value and services, meaning we offer a true partnership to listed companies. For exchanged traded fund issuers, NYSE lists ETFs covering more than 90% of the U.S. assets under management. And to attract more trading, we plan to expand the number of stocks traded on the NYSE floor to include all U.S. securities, further leveraging the benefits of our unique model. Why does this matter? It enables us to better serve our customers by providing the deepest liquidity pools with designated market makers that ultimately lower volatility. And when companies choose to list on the NYSE, this generates trading and data revenues as well. This is the virtuous cycle that demonstrates the synergistic nature of our model. Moving on to slide 12 and the transaction and clearing segment, you can see the results that our global markets continue to deliver. Futures volume and open interest grew solidly in the first quarter on top of a strong first quarter last year, despite there being less market volatility this year. Year-to-date our average daily volume is up 9%. Our markets our prudently diversified across products ranging from oil, natural gas, agriculture, equity indices, and interest rates. The breadth and depth of our markets enable us to attract liquidity and related products. As an example, we're growing the MCSI and FTSE index futures alongside European interest rate and foreign exchange futures. These are globally relevant products that allow us to attract more customers for trading and data consumption. Equally important, the trends in open interest are also directionally favorable in our key asset classes alongside of our volume growth. I'll move on to slide 13 for more detail on the global nature of our markets. You can see that when looking at volume during European and Asian market hours, we have a strong presence internationally. And we continue to build on that with products like Dubai Crude, Singapore Jet Fuel, Rotterdam Gas Oil, European Emissions, and Japan Naphtha, along with our benchmark European interest rate and equity index futures. On the slide, you can see the results of our comprehensive offering for the global oil markets which generated record revenues during the first quarter on record volume and record open interest. The range of energy products we offer continues to grow, not dissimilar to Amazon's model of a long-tail business where the breadth of our market contributes to the overall depth of our market. We have an unsurpassed energy commodity offering ranging from futures and OTC markets, the Platt's eWindow, the electric power and natural gas basis markets and the nearly 1,000 new products that we've developed for clearing to create a complete product suite. More broadly ICE's leadership in oil futures continues with over 50% of total open interest across Brent and WTI futures. And finally we continue to grow and have upside in supporting the market's desire for price discovery in electronically traded commodity options as evidenced by the 100% volume increase over last year's first quarter for screen-traded energy options on ICE. And despite the relatively low price volatility, we're growing our natural gas business globally given the increasing demand for cleaner fuels coupled to the abundance of supply. Importantly, our continued growth in the broad energy market is a key contributor for both our trading and data segments. Moving to slide 14, I'll touch on the momentum in our European interest rate business over the last year where volume and open interest continue to grow due to the activity of global central banks. While ICE's reported revenues have been impacted by the currency depreciation of Europe, the volume expansion of this business amid entrants like Nasdaq's defunct NLX and CurveGlobal demonstrates the value of our offering and our platform for future growth. While there's no explicit timetable for European Central Bank interest rate increases, our increasing trading volumes are positive indications of the market's prediction of an improving economy. On a related note, I was honored to be a panelist at the Prosperity UK Conference last week in London. The agenda was to look ahead to the UK's future in a post-Brexit world. Similar to the U.S. with our change in administration, the UK has an opportunity to also move towards a pro-growth platform and avoid the burdens of duplicative regulation. I believe that the UK has every ability to adopt policies to retain the business that it has earned and that the UK and the EU will find ways to work together constructively. I further believe that the evolving landscape in the EU will also offer ICE new business opportunities. We've been fairly transparent, however, in our beliefs that Europe's MiFID II is a poorly designed piece of legislation for the current environment and for providing the capital markets with certainty. I remain hopeful that as the billions of pounds and euros of compliance costs are considered relative to their benefit, we'll see new market-oriented solutions prevail. Regulation is needed but asymmetrical regulation can create unintended consequences, and this is one of the issues that policymakers at the IMF and the World Bank discussed last month at their meetings in Washington, D.C. That being said, ICE is preparing to serve our customers under all eventualities, as we always do, and we have a number of work streams ongoing to maximize the new revenue opportunities that this legislation creates. One such example is our recent agreement with Euronext to license our commercially open access clearing services at ICE Clear Netherlands. This is yet again an illustration of the value of having our global footprint in a fragmenting world. So we continue positioning our exchange, clearing, and data operations at the leading edge to help our customers and to provide solutions to them that are responsive to the ongoing changes in the global landscape. I'll close on slide 15 and I'll note that our focus has turned towards the balance of the year to build on our track record of growth. We're strategically executing across the broad opportunity set that we've covered on the slide here. I'd like to recognize and thank our customers for their confidence in the quarter and I want to thank my colleagues at ICE for delivering these great results. I'll now turn the call back to our moderator, Kate, to conduct the question-and-answer session until 9 :30 a.m. Eastern Time. Operator : We will take our first question from Richard Repetto of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Scott. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Morning. Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Good morning. Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : The first question is on the very popular topic of market data. And I'm just trying to see, Scott, whether the GAAP guidance of 5% growth is still affirmed in market data and it appears that you expect a ramp if currency stayed flat going out to replace the IDMS lost revenue. Is that correct, on a GAAP basis? Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: I'm not 100% sure I understood the second part of your question, Rich, but on one of the slides Jeff addressed, we did reiterate that we believe our data business will grow at least 6% for the year. I think that's further supported by the ASV metric, which is up 6%. IDMS and TMX Atrium, the net of those businesses I mentioned would reduce revenues about $12 million a quarter over second quarter, third quarter, and fourth quarter. That notwithstanding, I think what you'll see adjusted for that is we accelerated from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, adjusted for that reduction in that acquired and divested business. We'll see an acceleration into the second quarter, or we would have seen an acceleration. And I would expect we'll see an acceleration into the third and fourth quarter as well. So we're happy with the way the data business is trending and we're happy with the fact that what we're seeing is really solid growth on top of growth in the prior year. So, again, I didn't quite follow the second half of your question. If I didn't answer it, maybe try again. Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay. I think that answered it, or I'm sure other people will ask about market data as well. I'll limit myself to one follow-up, though. I guess I've got to ask this, Jeff, I've gotten a handful of emails about this. But there was an article from Bloomberg that came out talking about M&A. I know you don't discuss anything specifically, but I guess the broad question is wouldn't you think that it'd be \u2013 in any combination of two major futures exchanges, wouldn't there be antitrust or issues? It's certainly got everybody talking I guess this morning, if you can make any comments. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Well, I can't. And you graciously prefaced that in the question, so I appreciate that, Rich. You know, let me just say that I think that our company is unique in that we're always looking for ways to grow value for shareholders and we not only buy companies but we buy companies that we think we can grow organically. And we just proved that by the first question that you asked Scott. And we also dispose of companies where we think we're not good operators or where somebody else could do better with the firm than we could. So we're constantly looking at the way we go to market and try to be innovative. We look at deals that other people don't think about. And we're always amused when the market thinks we're going one direction and internally we know that the market is wrong; we're going another direction. So that's just part of the way we think around here, because I'm surrounded by a lot of entrepreneurs, and we're constantly generating new ideas on what to do to best serve customers given the macro trends in our space. So I'll leave it at that, if you don't mind, and let you guys go talking. Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay. I'll leave it at that as well, and I'll stay to the one follow-up. Thanks. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Michael Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Thanks, guys. Scott, maybe on the transaction side, particularly on that futures business, when we look at the trends, both open interest and ADV, and not just for April but year-to-date, things are looking pretty strong, obviously some tough comps last year. And just wanted to get a sense, obviously, there's some that's environmental, maybe on rate, the rate backdrop in Europe. But it also seems like on the desktop, like your revenue growth is picking up. So just wanted to get some sense on like maybe user growth versus the environment. Because it does seem like there's more going on than just a better environment for some of the products. So any color behind that would be helpful. Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Okay. Let me \u2013 there's somewhat two questions imbedded in there. Let me touch on kind of the futures business. We are seeing very strong growth. Through yesterday, overall volumes in the quarter are up 24%. In terms of revenue, as you mentioned, it's not only a tough compare, it's also a tough currency environment. And in interest rates in particular with the volatility, the customer mix has impacted rates. But as I step back and look at it, there's no question that we continue to see strong commercial demand around our platform. And that's what's really driving the volumes and, more importantly what's driving the open interest. Open interest up 9% year over year. There's not a better leading indicator for the robustness of the business as we look forward. Again, currency and mix and all the other factors aside, which you can't really control, open interest says that the commercial customers are still really interested in the market. And I'll give you a subset example of that. When I step back and look at the best indicator for our oil markets, to me that's open interest. And our open interest for oil went above 50% share about two years ago, and it stayed there. And again, I think that's an indicator that there's continued interest. Whether oil's moving up above 50 or down towards 50, the commercial customers are in there hedging their risk. So we've definitely seen continued strong growth and customer interest in our markets. And I think that's, as you mentioned, translating over into strength we're seeing in our desktop and connectivity business. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: I'll mention \u2013 the second part of your question, I mentioned in my prepared remarks but I'll elaborate a little bit. The reason that we're focused on the data part of our business is that historically exchanges like ours took data to market by basically wholesaling the data to third-party data vendors, and largely that data went into these large multi-asset class desktops that people were acquiring. Today we're seeing a different trend, which is our customers want more customized applications on their desktop, probably no different than you and I on our smartphone. And we see them taking, for example, MarketAxess screens for their bond business, FactSet screens for their equity business, Aladdin screens for risk management, and ICE screens for commodities. And so the nature of the desktop is changing to more tailored, bespoke, customized, targeted solutions. And the data that's underlying that, many people want it on a pipe. In other words, they want just to buy the direct feed from us so that they can customize and power the way that individual people in their operations are accessing data, using new algorithms, new risk management tools and alike that people are using to get an edge for trading and risk management, and also to be responsive to compliance. Just one other comment I'll make to elaborate on what Scott said about our interest rate business. What's been very amazing for us to watch is that our European interest rate business has been more responsive it seems to U.S. Fed actions than the U.S. interest rate complex. So in other words, the market is watching what the U.S. central bank does and is then imposing what the results of that are on Europe and abroad and reacting to that, and we see risk management being done in our market. So it's been an interesting suite of products to own where it's not necessarily directly correlated to what the ECB and the Bank of England do. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then just quick follow-up. Scott, just on the capital management, an active quarter when we look at buybacks data (32:00) and the dividend. Just any sense on what you think going forward in terms of priorities, whether it's given where the stock is, given the M&A environment out there, just any color? Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: I don't think it's really changed from our comments previously. As you probably noticed, we actually ended up spending more in the first quarter than we had originally indicated. We had said $200 million, we spent $230 million, and that did have to do with, as you say, our view on the stock price. You may recall that early in the quarter it was languishing around $57, $58 and we aggressively accelerated. I mentioned that through yesterday we're already at $80 million. We don't really project going forward in terms of what it's likely to be, but if you look at the first quarter and you look at the first third of this quarter, I think that gives you an indication of where we're headed. And I think the good thing is, I mentioned on 16 months past the close of the deal, with the Cetip deal closed, we're effectively at our leverage target. We've returned $900 million. We've shown a preference to share repurchases and that's historically been the case and I would expect it will be the case going forward. But don't miss the fact that the dividend is up 17% year-over-year in the first quarter and that's the, I think, third or fourth consecutive double digit increase since we instituted it. So really no change in terms of capital allocation as I said on the last earnings call. We think we can do strategic bolt-on M&A just as we're doing and continue to be really aggressive on repurchases and effectively return 100% of our free cash flows over the course of this year. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : The next question is from Alex Kramm of UBS. Please go ahead. Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, good morning, everyone. Just wanted to hone in on the market data again, particularly on the exchange data. When you look back 12 months in the second quarter of last year you got a pretty big bump that surprised lot of people. And I think one of the things that happened back then was that on the ICE futures side, some fee waivers expired. If I understand it correctly, there's a second component of that that happened this April. So could you just talk a little bit how what you expect here in the second quarter, how big that bump should be as well on a quarter over quarter basis. And then maybe just in general around exchange data, obviously, some of your competitors showed some weakness, so maybe you can compare and contrast your business there a little bit. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yeah, Alex. So, what you're referring to is that we used to have a group of people that got free data from us and we decided to convert everybody to paying customers. And so our customer base, if you will, for the purchase of data dramatically expanded as many of those people that used to get it through various sources for free turned around and signed subscription agreements with us. That is still in the marketplace. It's a broader audience, it gives us more people to sell to and so on and so forth. We haven't touched that program since instituting it a year ago but, as Scott has guided you, we do think that our overall data revenues are going to continue to grow along the way that we've been growing in the first quarter. Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yes, and I think specifically to the last part of your question, our exchange data business was up sequentially from the fourth quarter and we expect it will be it sequentially in the second quarter versus the first quarter. And, as Jeff alluded to, we continue to see more customers looking for different ways to consume more of our data. So we remain very confident in that business. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, 4% to 5% growth for the year on top of 14% growth last year. Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. And then just secondly something small here but, Scott, you had that one-time item in the first quarter here, the accrual for legal things, I believe. I don't know if you touched upon that in your prepared remarks but can you just flesh it out? And importantly, you said it was an ongoing item and it was $10 million this quarter, so just wondering is it something that actually happened in the cost base? Not trying to be too cute here but obviously it's $10 million. It gets you from the high end of your guidance range to the low end in the quarter so I feel like it's obviously important. Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yes. That's an accrual that's an estimate of potential exposure related to certain ongoing legal and regulatory matters. And I can't really say a lot more than that other than pointing out that by the nature of non-GAAP in it, it's our view that that's not a typical charge. And so I don't think it would be appropriate to look at as it's a difference between the high or the low end of our expense range. It's not something you'd put in the run rate moving forward. It's just, you know, as per accounting, when you come to a conclusion that you have an estimate of a potential exposure, you book it, and that's what we did. Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC : But it wasn't \u2013 you hadn't had anything related to that previously? So this was completely new, I guess the point. Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yes. Yes, again, which goes to the reason why we non-GAAPed it. Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC : All right. Perfect. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Kyle Voigt of KBW. Please go ahead. Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. I guess one on Europe and Brexit, and I know you made some comments around this in your prepared remarks, but it really seems like the tension continues to build around euro-denominated clearing and whether there's going to be a location requirement here post-Brexit. Am I interpreting your comments correctly that you think there will be an agreement reached there to keep this in the UK longer term? If you could just elaborate on that. And then maybe, secondly, as we think about the impacts to your business, can you just address some of the risks maybe around your IBOR and then some of the opportunities you talked about maybe in the EU post-Brexit. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Sure. Yeah, I mean I tend to think that markets are rational and so the UK and the EU will end up someplace that works for both parties. And we sit in the UK but the E.U. has an argument that I think has validity, which is that during times of stress, if there's stress on the euro derivatives market and the European Central Bank has to step in and provide liquidity, then it needs some visibility into the market. And so I see the debate that's going on right now is about the role of the ECB and the visibility that it has in these markets. And that, starting at that premise, that is a not irrational view for Europe. The question is how does that manifest itself? Is it an actual physical moving of products? Is it a joint oversight? Is it a college of regulators? There are a number of solutions that I suspect will be teased out during the Brexit negotiations. And I've long said that we have viewed the markets as becoming more fragmented due to the fact that regulators are implementing their version of oversight in different ways with different timetables. And we all went through a global conversion from analog to digital, where we could sit in our living rooms and access the rest of the world, and we're somewhat unimpeded in doing that, and that happened \u2013 so the birth of the Internet age. What's happening now is regulation is catching up and wants to have oversight locally. And so it's starting to fragment what we used to enjoy as a holistic market. And we've set the company up specifically for that. So our Netherlands operation, which is located in the EU, has now been converted over to have all ICE technology. We have a management team that we've put in place there. And if we needed to move certain contracts to the continent, it would be relatively easy for us to do that. In other words, it's database work for us. I'm not minimizing what that would mean for customers, because they will also have to change account structures and domiciles of how they manage those accounts and funds flow. But generally this is not about picking up and find new office buildings and relocating people. It's about moving files and legal structures. And so we're very, very prepared for that. I think that \u2013 my own view is that the UK has largely over hundreds of years been a global free market trade destination for people to do commerce, and that the EU has got a different agenda right now, which is integrating multiple countries, multiple cultures that have a common financial market. And that the divorce, while it's unfortunate, would allow each of those groups to focus on the thing that they want to focus on right now, and I think both will create opportunities for us. And we're thrilled that we are able to work with Euronext, for example, and move their derivatives clearing into our Netherlands clearinghouse. It is an example of the so-called open access where multiple exchanges share a common clearinghouse. We have a great relationship with them, given that we used to own them. We totally understand the business that they're bringing to us, we totally understand the technology. It's going to be a move that I think will be beneficial for both of us and probably would not have happened had there not been a Brexit. So I'm a glass half full kind of attitude and surrounded by entrepreneurs. And we see a lot of opportunity for the growth of our company, even though this is a pretty stressful time on a lot of companies in Europe. Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for the thoughts. Operator : The next question is from Vincent Hung of Autonomous. Please go ahead. Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP : Hi. So data ASV growth was 6% this quarter, looks to have declined versus the 8% in 4Q. Are there some moving parts impact in that? And can you also clarify the definition, if this is just referring to pricing and analytics? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yes. So, Vincent, the changed ASV is fairly simple. The ASV measures where we are entering the period this year versus the period last year. Entering the first quarter, the pricing policy changes that we implemented in 2016 were fully baked in. Entering 2016 back in the first quarter, they weren't, because as you know those were implemented in the second quarter. And so there's a bit of an apples and oranges that drove the 8%; that normalizes its way out entering the second quarter. Pricing policy changes were in the base last year, they're in the current year, and so year over year the ASV lines up more closely as you would expect with our expectation on revenue growth for the year. And with regards to your second question, I think what you may be asking is to refresh on what I said with regard to how we're thinking about the organic measure for pricing and analytics. And on that one, and frankly in the second quarter and the third and fourth quarter, we'll likely do a similar thing on desktops and connectivity. What we wanted to do is just give you a view of pricing and analytics, and again in future quarters desktops and connectivity adjusted for the material impact of the Securities Evaluations business, which we didn't own until the fourth quarter last year, and then IDMS business net of TMX Atrium, which really will reduce revenue 2Q through 4Q. So it's our effort to try and give you for each of those line items better visibility into the underlying business growth. I'll note that it's challenging, because the reality is the Securities Evaluations business in the first quarter was better than we expected and better than it was in the fourth quarter. And I would argue that that's largely because of our team and our ownership. That notwithstanding, I'm not trying to parse out which part of it was organic or not. But generally speaking, as we roll forward we'll try and give you that kind of visibility where any particular acquisition or divestiture impacts one of those line items in a material manner. Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP : Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks very much. Good morning. Maybe, Scott, if I could just zero in a little bit on the run rate in the second quarter, given we have some moving parts. So obviously we have the $12 million drop from the divestiture of IDMS net of the acquisition of Atrium. If we look at just sort of the organic growth rates that you're outlining for the year and assume that's a good run rate into the second quarter, I would get sort of a data number around $512 million, $513 million. Just want to make sure I'm doing that correctly and if that's a good run rate to base off of coming into the back of the year. And then if you can comment on Trayport and how that would \u2013 if you had to divest that, how much that would reduce the revenue by on a quarterly basis. Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yes. So first of all, I think \u2013 without validating your particular number, I think the logic you followed to get to it is spot on. So I think you're thinking about it exactly right. And with regards to Trayport, when we bought that business we noted that it was about $80 million of revenue at about a 50% margin. And I can't really say anything more to you about it right now. Obviously, we remain in the process. And if we get to a point where that trajectory changes, we'll come back and update guidance at that point. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. So that second quarter run rate then is clean now with deals at this level? In other words from a run rate perspective, that's what we should be forecasting going from that basis. Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yes. As we sit here today, yes. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Then just going back to Europe, Jeff, your comments on Brexit. If you had to bifurcate that volume on rates in the UK versus your Netherlands clearinghouse, would that be something more along the lines of separating just the Euribor versus the sterling, so keeping the sterling in the UK, Euribor over to Europe? Or would that be also really cutting up that Euribor and bifurcating that between European customers and UK customers, if you were forced to do that? Would you see that as something that would be impactful or not really that big a deal? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: That's a good question. I have had the great privilege of talking to senior managers at a lot of the banks that are coming up with contingency plans for various outcomes of the BREXIT negotiations. One of the interesting themes is that once things start to move, if they were to move, there aren't obvious lines of demarcation where things would stop. In other words, put yourself in the position of a bank manager. You have sales people probably already and you need then maybe risk management people and compliance people. And the next thing you know, you're moving more and more and more in order to support the organization. So as we talk to our customer base about how they're thinking of moving, we haven't come to an obvious answer, an obvious break point. And people are \u2013 all of us in financial services are thinking of the two ends of the barbell. What are the extremes if we don't go? And what are the extremes if we do go? And then what are the shades of gray in between? And it is not obvious. For us, however, you should understand that part of the logic of building this company has been to get everybody on a common technology so that our connections, for example, to market makers and banks, the way people are located to us, the way our data feeds operate, are really agnostic to where the geographic domicile for regulation is. And so a move is really, like I mentioned, more of a back office operation. Certainly has lots of implications and impact on our customers. But from ICE's standpoint, we've built the company to do that. And you've seen us move contracts and jurisdictions around already, move from one clearinghouse to another and move across various platforms. And that's the kind of business that we think a lot about and develop internal processes for. So we sit in a relatively luxurious position, waiting for the outcome of what our customers actually want to do. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So if those liquidity pools were cut up a little bit, you don't think that would have a material impact on the pricing ability on both the clearing and the trading side? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Might have just the opposite, in fact. We've seen \u2013 think about the new entrants that have come into some of our markets where they create a new pool of trading. Let's take energy for example, there's some new entrants, new pools of trading. What does it result for us? Record volume, record open interest, record revenue. Look at European interest rates, new competitor there, record volume for us. When you split these liquidity pools, and entrants may do that and regulators may cause that, what happens is that overall volumes tend to go up because the market starts to arbitrage and tries to put the market back together, the value of data goes up. And the whole thing for us turns out to be very good business. We fight that because we don't think it's in the best interest of the market. We have ways of growing otherwise, but we have positioned ourselves for more fragmentation which ultimately I think leads to higher revenues and earnings for ICE. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's great color. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs, please go ahead. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Just a clarification question, I guess at this point. So, Scott, I think you mentioned that your expense guidance for the year remains as you guys highlighted on the last call, I think it was $1.94 billion, $1.98 billion. Is that inclusive of the Atrium cost that, I guess, coming in this quarter. And then maybe you could just give us an update on run rate savings from IDC integration you guys expect to be at by the end of the year and how much is left for 2018? Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yes, so you're right the full-year guidance didn't change. We said it was $1.94 billion to $1.96 billion, (51:54) effectively flat versus the prior year. But last quarter I did mention that those expenses, it would be flat plus maybe $10 million to $12 million net of all the various acquisitions and divestitures that we have talked about to date. So again, still inside that range with maybe the acquisitions pushing it up a little above the middle overall. That's the reason why we didn't reiterate it, because we're still in the same guidance range. In terms of synergies, you may recall that we entered the year by increasing our synergies to $130 million to go. We said we'd get $60 million out this year, we're on track to do that. We said we'd get the remaining $70 million over 2018 and 2019 and I remain confident that we've got road maps in place to go and get those synergies, so. We feel confident about where we are from an expense management standpoint and a synergy realization standpoint. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it, thanks. Operator : The next question is from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities : Thanks, so you guys are doing quite well on listings versus your primary competitor. Wonder if you guys could talk a little bit about that, what's driving the success. And I know you guys have made a lot of investments in the New York Stock Exchange since you've acquired it. Is that having a positive impact? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yes, I think the second part of your question is the answer to the first, which is we've become more focused on it and we've really forced our team there to think about what is it that we do well and sell that, if you will, and allow our competitors to sell what they do well and let the market line up against those facts. In other words, we're not trying to being them and they're not trying to be us and the market is finding its natural home. What the NYSE does well with that floor-based system is large, complicated multi-national IPOs and it's just what the company is good at and it just so happens that a lot of the companies that are coming to market right now are those kinds of capital raise, and so we're doing well. There's a whole part of the market that we don't do well at that our competitors do better at and so we don't try to force our people to go after the ones that aren't obvious for us and that play to our strengths. It's just like any business, just getting people to focus on what you do well and sell it with passion has really helped the NYSE. And I think at the end of the day, it's just having a little more focus. Tom Farley, his new management team there are doing an excellent job of delivering that culture to the NYSE. Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities : Very good. And real quick, I know they're reasonably small but can you guys comment a little bit on the businesses you are acquiring, NSX and Atrium, maybe a little bit about the rationale and what your plans are for those. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Sure. Start with Atrium. One of the things that we inherited and we've talked about before is the network that was around the NYSE called SFTI. It was largely built because Reg NMS required that the exchange have connectivity to the other exchanges and market trading centers. The NYSE very interestingly built that out to lots of exchanges and lots of trading centers. And so it is a SFTI network. The acronym is SFTI but it's appropriately named in that it is not a high speed network that is full of microwaves, it is a network that is incredibly reliable and it's used a lot by people for their secondary business continuity planning. So having that, we've just found that, boy, if we can buy other content like Interactive Data company that we can make available on that network, it's perfect. We found that Interactive Data company also had needed connectivity to exchanges. So we've offered various feeds across that network, including the data and feeds and access to our competitors. We bought Atrium which was connectivity in Canada to TMX. It's for me, as an engineer, it was almost an overlap of network that we had. So it allows us to move their customer base onto our network and deprecate essentially all of their underlying network connectivity and use the pipes that we already have in place. So a small deal. Should be very accretive for us in the long run. And it gives us a whole new customer base to which to sell other services. So those are the kind of things that we're thinking about on these bolt-on acquisitions. I use the analogy of television network. We have a great network. But if we can find a hit program or maybe a small program that if we put it on our network, because of the distribution, we can make it a hit. Those are the kind of things that appeal to us. They're small but, as I mentioned, just having more breadth, more customer touch, more diversity in the way we solve financial service solutions is driving growth for us across related assets that we have. Operator : There are no additional questions at this time. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Sprecher for closing remarks. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Thank you, Kate. And thank everybody for joining us today. We'll look forward to continuing to update you on the progress that we're making as we go through the year. Have a good day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP Operator : Good morning and welcome to the ICE Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kelly Loeffler. Please go ahead. Kelly Lynn Loeffler - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Good morning. ICE's second quarter 2017 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investor Section of theice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions, and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2016 Form 10-K. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures including adjusted income, operating margin, expenses, EPS, EBITDA, free cash flow, and tax rate. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP term in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful as well as how management uses these measures. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Before I begin, I'd like to welcome Warren Gardiner to ICE as Vice President of Investor Relations. And I want to thank all of you for the opportunity to work together in my investor relations capacity from the early days of ICE. I look forward to continuing my role as ICE's Chief Communications and Marketing Officer. Also with us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Chuck Vice, President and Chief Operating Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Scott. Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Thanks, Kelly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll start on slide 4, with some of the key highlights from our second quarter. ICE's record revenue was driven by balanced growth across each of our business segments. Data revenues grew 6% versus the prior second quarter on a constant currency basis, driven by strong results in both pricing and analytics, and desktops and connectivity. In our trading and clearing segment, average daily volume or ADV grew 28% and open interest increased 12% year-to-year. Our double-digit volume growth and open interest trends reflect continued robust demand for our global trading and clearing services. Our record revenue results combined with continued expense discipline generated three points of adjusted operating margin expansion, and record adjusted earnings per share, which grew 9% over the prior year. And importantly, through the first half of 2017, we have generated roughly $900 million of free cash flow, which has allowed us to achieve our leverage target even as we return nearly 80% of that to investors. Now, let's move to slide 5, where I'll recap our second quarter consolidated financial results. Second quarter revenues were a record $1.2 billion, up 6% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted operating expenses in the second quarter were down 1% to $488 million, and adjusted operating margins expanded to 59%. Adjusted earnings per share increased 9% year-over-year to a record $0.75. As we look to the balance of the year, we expect third quarter and fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses in the range of $480 million to $490 million. We also expect to refinance our October bond maturities and anticipate that interest expense will be around $47 million for the third quarter and $49 million for the fourth quarter. Finally, we expect the tax rate to be around 31% in the third quarter. Please refer to our earnings release for further guidance details. Please turn to slide 6, where I'll discuss our data and listings segment. These largely recurring revenues comprise over half of our consolidated revenues in the second quarter. Segment revenues grew 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis including data revenues, which grew 6%. We expanded adjusted operating margins by 4 points year-over-year to 54%, which drove an 11% year-over-year increase in adjusted operating income. During the second quarter, we recognized a few million dollars related to ongoing data audits that concluded sooner than anticipated. Entering the third quarter, we also expect the ongoing integration of Securities Evaluations (05:10) to lower revenues by a couple million dollars, reflecting the rationalization of duplicative business lines. Even though we now expect 3Q data revenues to be a little below heightened second quarter levels, fourth quarter revenues will reaccelerate and we remain confident that we will deliver at least 6% growth for the year. Within our data revenues, pricing and analytics revenues increased 5% year-to-year on an organic constant currency basis driven by new customers and new product offerings. Our exchange data revenues grew 2% on top of last year's second quarter, which was up 17%. Continued strong demand for exchange data on both our rates and commodities platforms was partially offset by muted trends in cash equities markets related to historically low volatility environment. Finally, revenue in our desktop and connectivity category grew 7% year-on-year, on an organic constant currency basis, reflecting strength in both our connectivity and feeds businesses, which are benefiting from trends away from traditional delivery methods such as desktops For a little more color as to what is driving our data revenue growth, let's shift to slide 7. As I previously noted, we remain on track to grow the data business at least 6% on a constant-currency basis. As highlighted at our Investor Day in June, an important contributor to our confidence in this business is the momentum we continued to see in new business signings during the first half of 2017. First-half new contract signings in EMEA were up 18% and pricing and analytics signings in Asia-Pacific increased 15%. Finally, as we entered the third quarter, ASV or the annual subscription value is up 5% year-over-year. Underpinning this growth is 7% ASV growth in pricing and analytics and 8% growth in desktops and connectivity. Exchange data ASV was flat year-over-year against very strong growth in the prior period. Importantly, as a point-in-time metric, ASV does not reflect the future benefit of the cross-sell opportunities that our fully integrated sales team will continue to deliver, nor does it reflect any future pricing actions. Next on slide 8, I highlight the strong performance of our listings business. As previously noted, we've had great success in a very robust IPO market through the first half of this year. The NYSE is ranked as the number one listing venue for U.S. IPOs with 49 new listings and $19 billion of capital raised. And as you know, these wins drive listings revenue growth primarily in the subsequent year, while also generating meaningful adjacent revenues across both our trading and data segments. The NYSE continues to be the venue of choice for world-class companies and entrepreneurs. Through the first half, over 88% of all capital rate by the IPOs of U.S. operating companies and 28 of the past 28 initial listings above $700 million have happened on the NYSE. I'd like to pause here and note that with the sale of NYSE Governance Services on June 1, we expect listings revenues and expenses to each decline by approximately $4 million sequentially. I'll review our trading and clearing segment beginning on slide 9. Revenues were up 6% year-to-year on a constant currency basis and represent our second best quarter ever for futures transaction revenues. We also expanded our operating margin to 64%. As the leading global energy marketplace, we continue to innovate and now, for example, offer more than 500 oil products. We've seen strong growth again this year in our energy benchmarks in our new products as well as European interest rates and MSCI equity indices. ADV for the quarter was up 28% and we set ADV records in our Brent, sterling, and MSCI contracts. Finally, as you'll have seen in our volume press release this morning, the momentum continued in July with ADV up 11% and OI up 10%. And importantly, we saw a solid uptick in our energy and rates RPC in July versus June, coupled with continued volume growth. Continuing to slide 10, you can see that the growth in trading and clearing has been very balanced with contributions across our diverse global futures markets. ADVs for the first half was up 15% versus a strong first half last year, including record commodity volumes of 3.3 million contracts and record sterling volumes of 1.1 million contracts during the second quarter. Perhaps more importantly, open interest was up 12% versus the prior second quarter and up 22% versus the end of last year. Open interest is a key barometer of customer interest and engagement in our markets over the longer term. Turning now to slide 11, you can see how the operating margins in both our trading and clearing segment and our data and listing segments compared to our peers. Not only do the absolute margins distinguish ICE, but we have positioned ourselves in businesses which will generate high incremental margins on future revenue growth. This is enabled by execution of our synergy commitments and the proprietary nature of many of our product offerings. We have curated a diverse global business by organically investing in product innovation, by opportunistically acquiring assets from which we are able to extract greater levels of growth and profitability, and by efficiently divesting or discontinuing non-core assets. I'll close my remarks on slide 12. We generated nearly $1.1 billion of operating cash flow in the first half of this year, which allowed us to strategically invest in our business and delever to our target of two times debt to EBITDA. We also returned approximately 80% of our first half free cash flow to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. And we now expect to return around $1.4 billion during 2017, which is 40% more than any year in our history. We are well positioned to meet our objectives in 2017 even as we lay the foundation for continued success in 2018 and beyond. I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A, but for now, I'll hand it over to Jeff. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Thank you, Scott, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'll begin on slide 13. You've just heard the financial details on both the best quarter and the best first half in our company's history, which builds on the track record that you see here. We grew revenues, margins, earnings and capital return while executing on our strategic agenda. Our track record demonstrates the durability of our model. We continue to grow and outperform in a range of environments. This includes our growth through the financial crisis, a time of very high market volatility, as well as growth during the first half of this year, a time of historically low market volatility. At our Investor Day in June, we highlighted our strategic vision for delivering complementary solutions across global markets, which you can see if you move forward to slide 14. Today, we provide more mission critical high-value services than ever, and we're delivering on those across our integrated and widely distributed technology platforms. Our number one priority remains meeting our customer's requirements. These are evolving rapidly due to advances in technology and automation coupled with the demand for efficiency, regulatory compliance, analytical decision-making, and real time information. Historically, we sought primarily to serve the needs for price discovery and transaction execution. But the expansion of electronic markets and our coverage of virtually all asset classes today has pushed us deeper into data and information services. This is a virtuous cycle, where providing more information to users fuels market liquidity and the ability to transact and to manage risk. Through the lens of our customers' workflows, we've identified these shifts early in their cycle and expanded our solutions into these growth areas. And while we've primarily focused our attention on our new data segment in our remarks today, we're executing on meaningful opportunities across our global businesses. On slide 15, we've detailed several of the drivers contributing to both our near-term and long-term growth, and I'll highlight a few of these. You can see how our core exchange business continues to serve as a growth engine through which we deliver related services and expand our proprietary data content and distribution. Starting in the upper left quadrant, the unique technology infrastructure that we've integrated through various acquisitions, such as YellowJacket, NYSE, Interactive Data and TMX Atrium have uniquely positioned ICE to securely distribute our content. By innovating around these assets, we've developed new applications to meet risk managers' needs for their revolving workflow and cyber security. In the lower left quadrant, you can see the complementary growth across our lines of business. Scott highlighted our leading trading and clearing volume growth year-to-date, our consistent data revenue growth and the fact that we're beginning to execute on new international data sales. As our cross-selling efforts continue, we also expect to see further results from integrating across our markets and information businesses. On the lower right, you can see that we're also leveraging our unique assets along with making opportunistic acquisitions to serve customers in new ways. In 2018, we expect to complete our work on developing a new digital backbone for MERS and we continue to build liquidity in our inter-dealer bond market offering. And we're delivering more services through ICE Benchmark Administration. Today, we operate benchmarks for LIBOR, the gold price and the ISDA SIMM, among others. As announced last week, we've been awarded a mandate from the LBMA to operate their silver price benchmark. We also expect to begin offering clearing for that daily benchmark in connection with a silver futures contract just as we expanded to clear and trade the gold price benchmark. These are just a few examples of how we're holistically serving more of our customers' trading and risk management needs. Moving on to slide 16, our clearing infrastructure is an example of how we're continuing to build on our solutions synergistically. Clearing is widely recognized for its central role in managing risk and providing critical settlement information. Today, our global clearing houses serve our customers not only in trading, but by helping to meet their compliance, information and capital efficiency requirements. In operating our first clearing house a decade ago, we saw the value of market data, which enables us to develop and clear new products. In 2007, we cleared approximately 300 products. Today, that number is over 3,000 products. And this year's launch of our gold and silver contracts is just one more example of how we're leveraging our investments in data and clearing to create opportunities for our customers to trade, make informed decisions and manage risk. Our global clearing operations are also a key strength for us in addressing the changing regulatory dynamics brought on by Brexit, MiFID II, Basel and the ever evolving regulatory environment. While we continue to advocate for a delay in those parts of MiFID II that we believe increase systemic risk or add significant cost to investors without a commensurate return, there are many ways that we're actually serving the new unbundling, trading, clearing and data acquisition framework that's mandated by this regulation. With our exchanges and clearing houses on a common technology platform in the U.S., the UK, Europe, Canada and Asia, we're confident in our ability to support our customers when and wherever they choose to do business. Shifting to slide 17, I'll remind you of the growth drivers of our data segment in the quarter, which we also expect will be key drivers in the coming years. It's worth noting that these dynamics are creating demand in our trading and clearing segment as well. Whether it's an asset manager looking to expand its passive investment business, an active manager looking to outperform the benchmarks or a quantitative manager looking to feed an increasing amount of data into its trading engines, we continue to see a long-term pipeline of data demand. In June, we announced our plans to acquire the Bank of America Global Research index family, which is the second largest fixed income index provider after Barclays. We've innovated in this area, allowing our customers to further benefit from our expanding fixed income evaluated pricing and reference data services and we expect to have roughly $1 trillion of assets under management benchmarked to our fixed income index franchise upon the acquisition's closure, spanning government bonds, munis, corporates, commodities and equity indices. Together with our suite of pricing, reference data, indexes and exchange-traded fund services, we're increasing the range of solutions that are available to asset managers beyond their traditional providers, particularly as they seek new cost efficient end-to-end solutions. More broadly on slide 18, we're also rapidly executing on the global demand for our data services. Scott noted the double-digit growth in new contract signings in Europe and Asia during the quarter, which is not yet fully reflected in our reported metrics. We see sales in these areas as a growth opportunity and a solid tailwind. The opportunity in these regions is unique due to the demand for holistic data and information solutions. And because the markets that we serve are global and continue to automate, we're expanding both our sales team and our product sets there. In closing, on slide 19, I want to acknowledge Kelly Loeffler's role and her track record of success. Shortly after the company's launch, we asked Kelly to organize the firm in a way that would position us to become an NYSE-listed public company. Kelly decided that our company needed a budget and it needed metrics that would allow us to measure and track our performance and that we could no longer fly by the feet of our pans. She determined that we needed an investor massage and an outreach program to share our message with the public. She recognized that I could use a heck of a lot of support both on and off the court. So today after 51 earnings calls, this is the last time you're going to hear her voice in this venue. The results shown on slide 19 pretty much speak how all this turned out for us and to the competencies that she laid down for us to be a public company. ICE continues to invest strategically in growth. We refine our portfolio around core assets. We expand our margins. We return more capital as a result of our strong cash flow and we deliver at or ahead of our stated integration plans. So I'd like to thank our customers for their business and their feedback in the quarter and I'd like to recognize my colleagues at ICE for delivering the best quarter in the company's history. And finally, I'd thank Kelly for giving us the foundation to share this success with all of you here today. I'm now going to turn the call back to our moderator, Gary, and we're going to conduct a question-and-answer session until 9 :30 Eastern Time. Operator : The first question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Jeff, what are your thoughts on the planned elimination of LIBOR? I guess maybe how does the decision impact ICE directly given your position in the process? And then, I think more interestingly, there's so much tied to LIBOR, maybe from a higher level, where and how do you see the opportunities for ICE to benefit from the pending changes? Thanks. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Sure. Let me take the second half of that question first. We've built this company called ICE Benchmark Administration, which we're really proud of. We stood up a from-scratch entrepreneurial effort to build a bespoke benchmark administrator. And where there are opportunities to administer benchmarks, ICE is pretty much at the front of the line for any new product that comes out. So, while there is talk about potential new interest rate benchmarks that could evolve in the world, I wouldn't roll out the back that ICE Benchmark Administration will have a high likelihood of being the administrator of those benchmarks, given our track record. The second \u2013 and a little more detail, what today LIBOR is overseen by ICE Benchmark Administration and a large group of market participants that formally meet to contribute to how LIBOR will evolve. And before the financial crisis, it was an estimate provided by the banks. Today, banks still provide IBA with estimates, but they also provide IBA with all of the underlying short-term trading data that they have and the rationale and algorithms that they use to convert that into the LIBOR estimate. So, what the industry has been doing around LIBOR is correlating all of the short-term data information that it has through real transactions with algorithms and estimates on how LIBOR should be based on those going forward. And that work has largely been done. And there is a high confidence in LIBOR as it exists today, because the market knows that there is a lot of underlying data that's being looked at and correlated into the daily publication of LIBOR. Now regulators have said that they would like it to be specifically based on those short-term transactions. And Ken, let me give you an example of what they're really saying. You're a very good equity analyst, you're going to listen to our call today. I suspect you'll read all the materials we put out and typically you would write a note to your clients suggesting the valuation of ICE stock and where you think the stock price might perform in the future. And if I ask you to do that same exercise tomorrow and then the next day and then again the following day, largely little would have changed in the world that would cause you to change your estimate unless it was some macroeconomic trend that was impacting ICE. If I did that same exercise with you and said you must link your estimate to the stock price of ICE's stock today, every day your estimate would move because our stock price could easily move around in a given day. So, you may tell your client today that you think ICE could be a $100-a-share company and tomorrow if the stock price moved, you'd say it was $110, and the day after that you'd say it was $90, then you'd say it was $80, and then it was $200 and whatever. So, one of the complexities of introducing specific algorithmic tie to short-term trading is that the market doesn't use LIBOR in that way. And so the complexity is not tying LIBOR to the underlying movement of rates, it is coming up with the solution that will actually work for the market in doing that. It's a throwaway statement to say things should be more transparent or based on real transactions. This has to work in the real world and, as you pointed out in your question really, there're trillions of dollars of assets that are tied against that including, as Scott mentioned, the loans that he's going to go into the market and refinance that we use ourselves. And the market is not really ready yet. In the minds of the marketplace, we're overseeing this to put that into full transaction-based mode. The good news is that the FCA has required the banks to continue to provide that kind of underlying information for the next four years to IBA so that these solutions can be worked on. The regulators are in the room. There're in these meetings. There're aware of these issues. They're aware that there has be to a long transition period. I'm confident that that group is going to solve this problem and figure out a way to introduce these new metrics into the market in a way that will work for the market. Because there is a lot of thought and care going into. But, again, I would reiterate, in the meantime, there is a high level of confidence in the way LIBOR is operating today. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And maybe just as a follow-up. Do you see opportunities for ICE in this change in LIBOR in either the future side, maybe in the U.S., or the OTC side of trading globally? And I'll throw in just a thank you to Kelly for all the help over the years that she has given to me and the rest of investors. Thanks. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Okay. I'll give you a short answer to the second one since I gave you a long answer to the first one and the answer is, yes. We do see those opportunities and we do think there will be additional benchmarks and just in dealing with what I suggested which is a LIBOR that is going to be much more volatile in the future will increase the need for risk management around that. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks, guys. Just first question, just on the announcement related to Trayport, just wanted to get your updated thoughts on how that you expect that to play out, any potential impact? And then probably just broader, what it means in terms of M&A strategy and where the areas that you think you still see opportunities versus the areas that apparently appear more complex? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yeah. So, with respect to Trayport itself, I can't get into the details of the process other than to say there's tremendously high interest in the marketplace to be an owner of that company, which is good news for us. And it's important for us that \u2013 and to the regulators, but our interests are aligned in that we want it to be owned by a good operator, so that we can continue to be a potential customer of the company. And so, we have that interest as well as the regulator. In terms of impact, we'll give you guidance once we know the ultimate outcome of that process and when it might actually be spun out, but we've got nothing right now to say. Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: And just to be crystal clear, Trayport's assumed in the guidance that we've given you. I suspect it will be an immaterial impact this year. To the extent either of those changes, as Jeff said, we'll give you clear visibility as soon as we're able. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then, I guess, just anything on the M&A front in terms of the outlook, just given that process? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yeah. I would just say that M&A particularly within Europe right now is complicated. It's complicated by Brexit basically and what is the competitive landscape in a post-Brexit Europe and what will the great repeal bill that the UK is adopting ultimately mean for the relationship that the UK will have with Europe. And so in order to do anything that's sort of pan-European, a manager needs to have an outlook on how that's going to unfold, because it will affect the competitive dynamics of how the regulators will look at these things. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Okay. Thanks. Scott, just on the tax rate, is that mix or is there any tax changes impacting that? Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: It's largely mix. I mean, one of peers mentioned the change in the Illinois State tax, that impacts us a little bit. But the increase that you saw from 1Q to 2Q and then as I mentioned continuing into third quarter is mix to the U.S., in particular a really strong performance by the IDC business, combination of synergies that we're delivering and solid growth that we're seeing. We talked about the EMEA and Asia Pacific signings, which were really good. But as we showed you on Investor Day, over 70% of our business is in the U.S. and that business is doing really well. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Thanks a lot. Operator : The next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. I guess, Scott, if you could remind us from a synergy expectation kind of what's left? And as you think longer term, the growth rate of the overall total expense base, how we should think about that? Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Sure. So, we continue to execute on our synergy plan. We told you coming into the year, that we had $100 million to go and then we increased that by $30 million. I said $25 million to $30 million but I think most of you wrote down $30 million. So, we're driving towards that $130 million goal. We said we'd deliver $60 million this year. I'm very encouraged by the results through the first half with regard to that expectation. I think, more importantly, the $70 million subsequent to that six months later, we've really firmed up the vast majority of the actions that'll deliver those synergies as well. So, I'm very comfortable with the synergy performance through the first half of the year. I'm confident that we'll continue to deliver on the original $60 million, and possibly generate some upside to that this year. And then again, we've got a full blown roadmap to the full $130 million now. So, I feel good about it. And your second question, it doesn't end with just the synergies for the acquired businesses. We're constantly focused on ways to run our business more efficiently in the base as well. As you know, comp's about half of our overall expense base, as is demonstrated by the results. Once again, our employee population consistently earns increases on their comp. But that comp is also tied to our performance, and so it self regulates. To the extent we're not delivering, bonuses come down. To the extent we overdeliver, bonuses go up. So, I would expect that that comp expense, as it has over the past couple years, probably grows around 3% or 4%. I generally think the rest of it will be tied to revenue growth because a lot of it is expense, that when we're growing, it contributes like our listings performance right now. That drives some marketing expense, but the revenues more than offset it. So, I think, over the longer term, what you've seen from us is somewhere between flat to plus 3%. And at least for the foreseeable future, I don't know why you'd have an expectation of more than that. So, I think expenses will continue to be managed in a way that'll allow us to grow profit faster than revenue. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Great. And then just a follow-up on the revenue outlook and wondering if there are any pricing changes in the quarter across either the data side of the business or within transactions, and maybe thinking about that for the remainder of the this year, if there's anything that's kind of in the hopper to come. Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yeah, so through the year, there's nothing in particular from a pricing standpoint that's driving the results. Right now, what really is driving it are new products, new customers, you see it in our signings results. We mentioned at Inventor Day that pricing is an element of our growth model. I think we said then that it was around 30% and then the debate ensued whether that was too much or too little. But I still think that's a reasonable expectation as you think about next year and the year after and the year subsequent. But, in this year, what's driving the performance year-to-date is signings, new customers, new products, and we're particularly pleased with the results we're seeing in pricing and analytics, in connectivity and we made a brief mention of it in our prepared remarks, but our feeds business is doing really well. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, guys, for taking the question. Couple of questions this morning. So maybe the first one around just some of the equity market structure dynamics. So Chairman Clayton obviously suggested that the SEC is looking to revisit some of the equity market structure topics, including lowering access fee caps. Jeff, can you guys remind us I guess where do you stand on this issue and what this could mean for NYSE if fee caps are lowered and how that should kind of play out in the business model? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Well, we've suggested that we believe that there is an opportunity to lower those caps. However, it should be done in connection with a broader restructuring of the market so that both lit markets and dark markets are operating under similar types of rules of engagement. Because what you don't want to do \u2013 and you can come up with scenarios where you lower the cap but all you're really doing is incenting people to leave the lit markets. The rules of engagement in many of the dark pools is not transparent and it's unclear what kinds of fees are being paid there and what kind of incentive programs exist and so on and so forth. And so it has to really be a holistic view. But we would certainly support a holistic review of the markets. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And just a follow-up for Scott. Looking at the annual subscription value metrics that you guys put out, those are helpful. I guess, as we look at the different line items there, pricing, analytics and desktop connectivity obviously seemed to kind of carry the organic growth momentum in the bucket. How does profitability across these services vary? And I guess what I'm trying to get at really is just thinking through the margin implications of some of these areas growing a little bit faster than the others, what does it mean for the data services margin as a whole? Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yeah. So look, I think the opportunities for the data margin are to continue the trend of expansion. Pricing and analytics and exchange data margin dynamics are really similar. And then I made a comment in my prepared remarks with regards to the fact that each additional dollar of revenue historically in the exchange data business has driven high incremental margins because it's an incremental user of data that it's already produced. It's similar in pricing and analytics. To the extent I've got 10 people that buy a particular bond price and I can then sell it to an 11th, a 12th, a 13th, there's not a lot of incremental expense that comes along with that. So, incremental margins on pricing and analytics and exchange data are very positive. Connectivity is a little lower only in the sense that that is where it requires some fixed assets, because as we build out capacity to handle more customers or we build, for example, larger ports for those customers to connect to, there's a little more incremental expense that will come with that. That notwithstanding, the incremental margins are still very attractive. So, I don't view it as a particularly large difference among the three and do believe then across the three \u2013 if we're getting growth regardless of which of the three or all of the three or two of the three it comes from, incremental margins will be solid and will contribute to expanding margins at the bottom line for that segment and for us as a company. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : The next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead. Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah, hey, good morning. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Good morning. Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC : Wanted to just come back to Dan's question on the pricing side. I think, Scott, you answered it on the data side which we've all been focused on, but can you talk a little bit on the transaction side as well? I mean, if you look at this quarter, on a year-over-year perspective, what stands out is on the interest rate side in particular really strong volume growth but the revenues didn't really follow through as much. And I know there was some FX, but it seems like mix is hurting you as well. And I saw you made some changes on the deals pricing a couple months ago and some ag stuff here and there. Just thinking holistically, I mean, is it time that you use your market strength on the transaction side a little bit more to drive pricing upside there as well? I mean, your primary competitor has been doing that for the last few years here and there as well. So, any new thoughts? Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yeah. So, I give you a couple of thoughts. The first one being that we're outgrowing the competitor you referred to. But the second one is with regards to pricing, FX is clearly affecting financials and so there is no price action to take to address that. That will somewhat self-correct as we move into the fourth quarter. We have had some mix impact in particularly volatile periods and this has always been the case, whether it's volatility that's Brexit driven or European economy driven, we tend to see a mix to heavier liquidity providers or market makers which tend to benefit more from the lower rates. The same thing is true in energy, where in oil we've seen volatility and a mix of a bit more of the market makers. We did see in June a little bit bigger dip than we had anticipated. We went back to the drawing board and redesigned some of the market making programs in both energy and financials and saw marked improvement in July RPC versus June. You won't see it in what we reported, because we report a three month rolling average and so effectively June, it will take all quarter to roll the impact of June out. But I will tell you and I'll give you specifically within our energy RPC, we were up 4% or 5% in energy in the month of July versus the month of June. And so as that rolls through to the whole quarter with the volume growth that continued year to year, it's a good arbiter of what we expect in terms of an ability to continue to grow our trading revenues. Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC : All right. Great. Thank you. And then on the data side, maybe on one specific area, I mean, yesterday you had the announcement with T. Rowe on the real time evaluated pricing. I think that's been an area of focus in the past. Can you just help us how to think about that opportunity going forward. I mean, I know you're not going to be specific about T. Rowe, but as you think about the addressable market, the number of asset managers or banks that really you're targeting or should be targeting, then how big the range of revenues could be for a typical asset manager or bank, so we can start dreaming a little bit about that potential business here? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: So, I'll just sort of highlight really what we're seeing and it was really written through our prepared remarks. But there is \u2013 a data strategy today needs to think about these macro trends and the more you can set this sail of your boat into these winds, the better you're going to do. And that's really how we've been trying to focus the business. The first is that there's a movement away from these large multi-asset class screens to data provided on feeds that are feeding bespoke applications, quantitative algorithms, and other kinds of things. So, there's a move from screens to feeds. There is more growth, we believe, in EMEA and Asia than in the United States. So, you need a distribution system that will get you to other geographies for us as Americans. There is a fundamental change going on in high frequency trading in the United States. It is no longer \u2013 the flash boys kind of phenomena in my mind is being arbitraged out of the market. Exchanges have been changing their policies and systems and brokers and customers have been changing their algorithms in the way they approach markets. And so, the kind of high frequency trader that's demanding data today is slightly different than the one in the past. They're more quantitatively oriented and need data in ways that kept them drive those kind of quantitative algorithms. There's fragmentation going on. Wherever there are markets where there's fragmentation, customers want to reassemble the market. And so, the areas where you see more fragmentation, you see our revenues growing faster. And lastly, as Scott and I pointed out, there is a lot of new regulation coming on that are really putting pressure on end users to take the kind of products that you mentioned, Alex, and use those in their workflow to make sure that they're getting best execution. So if you think about our strategy, the way we're thinking about our strategy is how do we get our sales in each of those wins and we do have a solution for all of those and it's why for the first time in the history of our company, Scott has been guiding to real substantial revenue growth that we think we can sustain over a long period of time. Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC : All right. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Ben Herbert with Citi. Please go ahead. Ben Herbert - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask, we've been hearing a little bit more from ETF sponsors around self-indexing and wanted to get your perspective on conversations or how you think that might impact your business there? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: We're actively involved with a lot of people in those kinds of conversation. So I would affirm that what you're hearing is what we're hearing. We have announced pretty publicly some major transactions with BlackRock on fixed income ETFs. We're in a very good position because we as a company, I don't really care whether we license you an index that's tied to AUM or whether you create an index or we create an index for you, but underlying is our data, which you'll acquire. In other words, whether you acquire the index from us, which we can calculate and use our data or whether you acquire the data and do it yourself, we're agnostic. And so it puts us in a unique position vis-\u00e0-vis many of the indexers to have these kinds of conversations with end users. We have the calculation engines. We have the data, we have the reference data that underlies that. We have a very good brand in the name of New York Stock Exchange. We have the listings venue. And so, all of that can go into a conversation on how we can help you. And those are conversations that we're having across the industry. Ben Herbert - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. And then just maybe a follow-up on fixed income ETFs specifically and how you might or how you might size or think about the listings opportunity off that? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: I think ETFs for fixed income are popular and on the rise and it's simply because it's hard for you and I as individual investors to acquire and own bonds. And to the extent that you want fixed income in your retirement account or portfolio, you're going to want some diversity of types of bonds. And what we are seeing is wealth managers are preferring to allow professionals to put those portfolios of bonds together and offer them to the market in a low-cost manner through an ETF. And so, I really do think that that's an area on the rise. It's an area that if you are an ETF provider, you can differentiate yourselves. It's somewhat hard to differentiate yourself if you're simply using a broad market-based equity index because most of your competitors will offer those. In fixed income, with so many SKUs that exist in the world, you can put together different kinds of portfolios, different kinds of metrics that can differentiate you from your peers and so we see a lot of work going on there. We're providing a lot of underlying data and analytics to ETF providers as they think about how to find niches in the market. Ben Herbert - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Please go ahead. Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First one is really on the corporate bond business. I know at the Investor Day you pretty clearly laid out the fact that ICE is focusing on the institutional dealer to dealer corporate bond market, but just given some of the recent press on retail bond trading platform for sale. I'm just wondering given the collection of assets you have, including NYSE bonds, could you just give us an update on how you view or how core you view the retail space for you or is the focus right now on growing the institutional side? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: It's a good question. We are really looking at the fact that we kind of have this core fixed income data and distribution infrastructure and then we think about are there other products or services that we could add to that network that would be accretive. And to the extent that we were to acquire something, will have returns above our cost of capital that would outperform other uses of our capital such as share buybacks. So I think, long story short, we're opportunistic. We look at anything that is available as a buy versus build, but in the background we're also considering how we use capital and what we can build ourselves. Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. And then just a follow-up, just more of a cleanup question for Scott. The $480 million to $490 million adjusted expense guide for 3Q, just wanted to confirm does that already reflect the sale of NYSE Governance Services or should we model that on top of the guidance? Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: It already reflects it. Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, folks. Maybe, Jeff, just to go back to the LIBOR, I guess, the debate about the benchmark. How do you view, as you mentioned, hundreds of trillions of dollars of loans and securities are linked to the rate. I guess, how do you view the process of untangling that in the loans and securities and benchmarking that to a different rate? Is that something that's going to be sort of prohibitive and therefore keep LIBOR going well beyond 2021 or is it something that's easier to fix? And then if you could just comment how you think it's going to impact your Euribor franchise on the (50:01). Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Sure. So I think one misunderstanding is that we publish 35 LIBOR rates. The alternatives that both the U.S. Fed and the Bank of England have proposed have a single overnight rate. The single overnight rate is the \u2013 in other words, the overnight LIBOR is the least used of the 35 rates that we put out. The market can't use those as a substitute as they exist today. What really needs to happen is confidence in the entire 35 rate portfolio of LIBOR across its entire pricing curve with underlying transactions that are much broader than overnight rates. And so I don't think it can be substituted as it's discussed right now. The only and my own view is, it's going to be easier to continue to build confidence in LIBOR than it will be to build 35 new rates that over a period of years that the market is prepared to substitute. Some of the efforts of the central banks are already feeding into the work that the LIBOR oversight committee is doing. And so, it's helpful in that sense, but one should understand that if there was a good substitute, the market would have already substituted it. We wouldn't need to have the debate, but there is not a good substitute. Something needs to transition and improve in order to continue to build confidence. And I think ICE Benchmark Administration has the infrastructure to do that. And so, we'll see how that plays out. But we didn't start this work today, we've been doing this now for the last few years. So there is a very, very deep-rooted effort going on and a head of steam on how to do these replacements. The point that I made earlier is that even any transaction-based substitute is going to have more volatility in it. And the market has to figure out how to work around that. Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: And Jeff noted it earlier, but, again, I've got a bank facility that's a five-year facility that as we start to think about our refinancing, it will include LIBOR as the base. So while the people who trade LIBOR at the banks may be talking about what they'd like to see as replacement, the people who are out helping firms like ours raise capital are still embedding LIBOR in their agreements for long periods of time. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right. So, this whole thing was going to play out a lot longer than 2021 it sounds like. Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Absolutely. I can't imagine that the number of corporate deals that have been struck around LIBOR that will have to be renegotiated and I can imagine how I'm going to feel if a bank comes to me and suggests that I need to go hire lawyers and pay them to help me renegotiate just around that fact. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right, right. Great point. Okay, and then just as a follow-up, maybe just go back to the data business. Jeff, you really outlined well I think some of the long-term growth drivers just in that response to a couple questions ago. As we think about, I guess, the organic data revenue growth of 4% year-over-year is how do you think about that accelerating? I think you were talking, of course, at the Investor Day of more longer-term mid-to-high single-digit potential. Do you think we'll begin to see that in 2018 with some of the themes that you mentioned, Jeff, including MiFID II? Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: So let me start and then Jeff can jump in. I wouldn't get too hung up on the 4% given that, as we noted, pricing and analytics was up 5%, desktops and connectivity was up 7%. And if you peel back the exchange data, that was largely a phenomena for the NYSE, which was down 5% year-to-year, while our commodities part was up 7%. So I would argue that embedded in the 4% is, if you will, a very narrow issue around NYSE data and the rest of the business is performing right in the middle of the mid to high single digits that we guided. And so we delivered it last year. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're going to deliver it again this year at 6%. And I do think particularly with the strength of the signings that we will deliver it again in 2018 and are positioned, based upon the model we showed you at Investor Day, to do it continuing. And again, it's based on new products and all the dynamics that Jeff talked about in Europe around MiFID and best execution. It's a growing presence in Asia Pacific which is the fastest-growing region and it's really a single sales team selling across the breadth of the products we have in the Americas. So, we feel good about the rest of this year. We felt good about the quarter, and I think we are well positioned to hit that mid-to-high single-digits growth into the future. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: And the NYSE data phenomena is that during periods of very low volatility, more business during the day goes into the dark pools because the market isn't that volatile, which then affects how the data revenues and messages to the exchange and the way data revenues are allocated. It's a phenomenon that isn't specific to NYSE, specific to all exchanges. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great, great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks, guys. Another one on data. Europe tends to be a little bit more of a mature market and you guys showed that the industry overall, the growth about 1%. But you guys are seeing 18% growth there on contract signings, which is really just obviously very strong. Can you comment a little bit on why your growth is so strong there in EMEA versus the industry on average? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yeah, I would say at the end of the day, there's specific requirements under MiFID that are driving end users to change their workflow. So, as we pointed out with the press release that we had with T. Rowe, we have products that allow people to assure that they're getting best execution in the fixed income space. That's popular. Secondly, people are bracing for more fragmentation as a result of MiFID. When fragmentation happens, the wallet increases as people try to put the market back together. I mean, in fairness, we advocate that there shouldn't be fragmentation. We think it's bad for risk management. But it's good for revenues. And we're talking out of both sides of our mouths, honestly. But I tend to think that the more we can do to help customers, the better we'll be in the long term, which is why we're advocating against fragmentation. But we're doing well as a result of it. I think this trend is going to continue, there's a lot of people that are unprepared for MiFID. We're going on sales calls and cold calling people to talk about these things and they look at us like we have three eyes and don't understand what it is we're talking about. I think there's going to be quite a lagging impact. And given the uncertainty around MiFID that's going to be caused by Brexit, I think that that trend is going to be in the market for many years. Operator : The next question comes from Vincent Hung with Autonomous. Please go ahead. Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP : Hi, good morning. So I'll give this a shot. How much revenue do you generate from indices now pro forma for the recent index acquisition? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: How much revenue we generate \u2013 Vincent, say the last part of your question again. Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP : From indices now, pro forma for the recent acquisition. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: I assume you're referring to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch. That deal hasn't closed yet. So that hasn't impacted our revenues at all and we haven't to this point broken out indices as a separate line item in revenue. Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: But to be clear, the reason that we're interested in the Bank of America indices is that we would want to fuel them with underlying ICE data. So Bank of America has been making that transition while they own them so that when those indices come to us that they'll be potentially all on ICE data. So whether we license the index or sell the data, we're kind of agnostic honestly. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Sprecher for any closing remarks. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Well, thank you, operator, and thank you all for joining us today and so we'll look forward to updating you as we work to close out the year and hope that we can continue to talk to you about building on this record performance that we had in this quarter and in the half. Thank you and have a good day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Operator : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Intercontinental Exchange Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator instructions] Please also note, today's event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Warren Gardiner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead. Warren Gardiner : Good morning. ICE's third quarter 2017 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived, and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of these risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2016 Form 10-K. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including adjusted income, operating margin, expenses, EPS, EBITDA and tax rate. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP term in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful as well as how management uses these measures. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses, and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Also with us on the call are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Chuck Vice, President and COO. I'll now turn the call over to Scott. Scott Hill : Thanks, Warren. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our third quarter performance. ICE's third quarter revenues were up 6% versus the third quarter of 2016, driven by solid growth across both our trading and clearing segment and our data and listings segment. Data revenues increased 6%, and trading and clearing revenues increased 8%, supported by a 15% increase in volumes. Adjusted operating expenses were down 2% year-over-year to $476 million and benefited from a few million dollars related to reserve releases in SG&A. Adjusting for that benefit, we still would have been around only $480 million in expense, and we expect to be around the same level in the fourth quarter. More importantly, we now expect full year 2017 synergies of at least $70 million, up from our original guidance of $60 million. The solid topline performance and lower expenses combine to generate a three-point expansion in adjusted operating margin, a 13% increase in adjusted operating income and a 14% increase in adjusted earnings per share. Finally, our profit growth has enabled us to generate strong cash flows during 2017. We used that cash flow to achieve our leverage target and to return over $1 billion to investors via share repurchases and dividends through October. In addition, that financial flexibility put us in a position to announce a number of important strategic investments during October, which will cause minimal impact to our leverage and no change to our capital return plans. Now let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide some additional color on our capital return priorities. We've generated over $1.4 billion of operating cash flow so far in 2017, and we remain on track to return over $1.4 billion to our shareholders this year, more than in any year in our history. Also of note, as we highlighted in our press release this morning, our board recently authorized a new $1.2 billion share repurchase program that will start in 2018, an increase of 20% versus our previous authorization. Please turn to Slide 6 where I'll discuss our data and listings segment. These largely recurring revenues, once again, comprised over half of our consolidated revenues in the third quarter. Segment revenues grew 4% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. Data services revenues grew 6% on a constant-currency basis, underpinned by organic growth of 5%. We expanded adjusted operating margins in the data and listings segment by 5 points year-over-year to 55%, driving a 14% increase in adjusted operating income. In light of the recent U.S. Treasury report, we thought it would be helpful to provide some additional context around our realtime proprietary cash equity revenue. You can see on the chart on the lower right-hand side of the page that realtime cash equity data makes up only a small fraction of our data and listings segment revenue. The vast majority of our $2 billion data revenues are derived from a broad array of proprietary pricing data, reference data, analytics, indices, futures data and desktops and connectivity solutions across multiple asset classes and consumed by customers around the world. Of note, our data revenues will grow 6% in 2017 despite an overall decline in revenues associated with realtime cash equity data products. Perhaps more importantly, we remain confident that our business is well positioned to continue to generate the mid- to high-single digit growth profile that we laid out for you at our Investor Day in June. The metrics that support our confidence are shown on Slide 7. In particular, our annual subscription value, or ASV, was up 6% year-over-year on an organic basis entering the fourth quarter. In the Americas, revenues were up 3% year-over-year during the third quarter on an organic constant-currency basis. Growth in new product sales and new customers driven by our fully integrated sales team more than offset the 6% decline in realtime proprietary cash equity revenue. Signings in our Americas pricing and analytics business grew 4%. We've provided signings as a new metric for only pricing and analytics because the metric is most indicative for that business. In EMEA, revenue grew 10% during the quarter, and signings in our pricing and analytics business grew 8%. With the demands from MiFID II building, customers are turning to ICE for our best execution and liquidity indicator products as well as our expertise in navigating change. Asia Pacific was our fastest-growing region in the third quarter, with revenues up 11% year-over-year and pricing and analytics signings up 13%. We continue to see opportunity to gain share in a growing market, and we are investing in the region. In addition, we recently announced additional connectivity solutions through our venture with Go West, which we believe will ultimately prove to be an important step in bringing ICE's full suite of trading, clearing and data offerings to the region. I'll review our trading and clearing segment on Slide 8. Revenues were up 8% year-to-year, and our operating margin expanded to 62%, driving an 11% year-over-year increase in adjusted operating income. You'll note that, as expected, our RPC rebounded versus the second quarter. I'd also like to highlight the strong performance of our CDS clearing business through September. Through the first nine months of 2017, revenues have grown 9% versus the prior year, and we expect to exceed $110 million in revenues for the full year. The drivers of our third quarter trading and clearing growth are reflected on Slide 9. Average daily volume, or ADV, grew 15%, driven by a 35% increase in interest rate ADV, a 22% increase in oil ADV, and a 16% ADV increase in our MSCI equity indices, which had a daily record of 1.3 million contracts during September. Open interest increased 14% from the prior year, led by EU and U.K. interest rates, with open interest up 46% from the prior year and record Gasoil open interest, which surpassed one million contracts for the first time. We expect to publish our October volumes tomorrow, and are pleased that oil volumes remain strong, with average daily volumes up 12%. More importantly, total open interest across our futures and options platform is up 11% versus October of last year. Before turning the call over to Jeff, I'll note that we have included Slide 16 in the appendix of our presentation to provide a summary of the trailing 12-month impact of our recent acquisitions. This is for illustrative purposes only as the timing of closing for BondPoint and MGX are as yet undetermined. You will see, however, that the net impact from our divestiture of Trayport and the additions of the Bank of America Merrill Lynch indices, NGX Shorcan and BondPoint is a small increase to revenues, expenses and profits. We will provide further information regarding expected 2018 implications during our fourth quarter earnings call. We also included some guidance updates in our press release this morning, and I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll turn it over to Jeff. Jeff Sprecher : Thank you, Scott, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'll begin on Slide 10. We continue to position ICE to meet the evolving risk management needs of global markets. Providing solutions to facilitate change and alleviating pressure points along the way has been a guiding principle throughout the life of our company. We've consistently and methodically broadened the scope of our business, adding unique content and expanding distribution. With each step forward, we've enhanced how we serve the workflows of our customers. And as global market structures evolve, regulation changes and technology advances, the value we provide to our global multi-asset class, risk management platform is rising. This philosophy underpins the strategic rationale behind our recent investments. The addition of the Bank of America Merrill Lynch indices broadens our content and scales our index business. BondPoint will enhance our footprint in the global bond markets. NGX will contribute new solutions to our leading global energy markets, and our stake in Euroclear offers us exposure to Europe's largest custodian at a time when collateral management is in focus. Turning now to Slide 11, I'll go into more detail on the strategic rationale and the opportunity that we see with the Bank of America Merrill Lynch indices. With over 5,000 indices representing over $1 trillion in benchmark assets under management, ICE is now the second-largest fixed income provider globally. But what really differentiates us, and what we think will drive our growth in a rapidly expanding market, is our complete offering. Providing solutions that range from reference data, pricing data and index calculation services to a listing venue and a trading venue, to a multi-asset class analytic platform, we have a full-service offering serving both active and passive investment strategies. As ETF sponsors search for flexible ways to lower costs and enhance quality, they're increasingly turning to self-index solutions, such as those provided by ICE Data Services. In addition, the range of providers has historically been highly fragmented across services. Today, ICE is able to tailor holistic solutions for fixed income participants, a value proposition that has not historically been available in the market. Continuing on this theme, and turning to Slide 12, I'd like to mention that last week, we announced plans to acquire BondPoint, expanding our presence in the fixed income markets. BondPoint's all-to-all trading platform and leading position in the retail channel will provide us with the opportunity to engage new customers and expose them to our broad array of risk management tools and content. Coupled with our existing dealer platform, it will enhance our solutions suite in the fixed income market that is rapidly automating and seeking efficiencies that electronic solutions can bring. By leveraging ICE Data Services' continuous evaluated pricing and analytics suite as well as ICE's existing technology and distribution, BondPoint will be uniquely positioned to contribute to our track record of bringing transparency and innovation to global markets. Moving now to Slide 13, I'd like to highlight the positive trends in our trading and clearing business, in particular our global energy complex. As a leading energy marketplace, we continue to address the increasing demand for comprehensive risk management solutions, not only in the crude oil markets, but across refined oil products as well. In our flagship Brent complex, average daily volume rose 20% year-over-year in the third quarter, was up 19% year-over-year in October and is on pace for its 21st consecutive record year. Within the oil indices, Brent is widely acknowledged as the global pricing benchmark due to its role as a reference price and its impact on pricing products in all stages of production. And Brent crude's origin as a seaborne benchmark has engrained the Brett index in the global contracts, pricing over 2/3 of the world's crude oil. It's one of the reasons why ICE's energy RPC has been resilient compared to competitors. WTI crude has been in contango due to the current high storage levels of oil at Cushing, Oklahoma and the constraints that surround it. While the forward curve for Brent has been in full backwardation, this signals a tightening physical market for Brent, as demand improved, as the commercial destocking progressed and as OPEC adhered to supply cuts. The dialogue that we hear around the global relevance of WTI versus Brent is, quite frankly, a red herring. Crude oil is not a homogenous commodity. And while WTI has current trading support from local cyclical storage problems, it is in contango. And the current data shows that when U.S. crude is transported to the Gulf for export, its forward prices are backward-dated, not in contango. There's a $4 price difference from WTI, and the pricing arb is established against the similarly backward-dated Brent complex. It is the Brent index that U.S. producers seek for forward price protection, as exported WTI joins the millions and millions of barrels that are already in seaborne motion. So, we continue to invest in Brent's future as it remains the cornerstone of an energy supply ecosystem that spans across an array of products, risk management tools and clearing services. I also want to highlight the addition of NGX's Shorcan, which we believe will only enhance our solutions serving the North American oil, natural gas and power markets. We've been working with NGX for over a decade. And upon closing, it will bring us additional physical clearing solutions, enabling us to more effectively serve our commercial client base. Similar to other investments I've spoken about today, this transaction checks the key strategic boxes. It enhances our content, it broadens our risk management services and it expands our distribution. I'll conclude my remarks now on Slide 14 by taking a moment to comment on the white paper released by the U.S. Treasury Department last month. Since we became the owners of the New York Stock Exchange in 2013, NYSE President, Tom Farley, and I have been discussing a proposal with market stakeholders, which we developed to improve the structure of the U.S. equity market. We do this in an effort to improve market structure for investors and the capital-raising activities of our listed companies. Our proposal attempts to find ways to reduce market fragmentation and produce the most efficient match for buyers and sellers with low friction costs. We're encouraged that the Treasury report picks up on many of these concepts that we've been promoting, and we appreciate the time the Treasury officials spent seeking our input. For the market to be improved for end users, a group of these ideas would need to be implemented as a package in order to get at the root causes of fragmentation and not just treat its symptoms with one-off remedies. Since the Treasury report was published, we've received a number of questions from investors regarding NYSE's data sales. As Scott mentioned, the sales of NYSE realtime equity data products are expected to be less than $90 million in annual revenue to us, and their growth has been relatively stagnant. These products account for approximately 2% of ICE's annual revenue. And whether their growth continues to slow, stabilize or improve, over time, it will not be particularly meaningful to the growth plan that ICE is pursuing. One should also note that in the context of approximately $8.5 billion in annual commissions that are charged to the U.S. equity market participants, any reduction in growth of our realtime market data fees is unlikely to enhance market quality for investors or encourage companies to go public. In fact, given their low relative cost within the industry, these realtime products seemingly receive much more publicity and attention than they deserve. The more-than-decade-long litigation over realtime fees, which has been the source of much politicizing, seems to be rooted in the earlier analog-to-digital conversion that surrounded the adoption of Regulation NMS. In 2005, a transition environment that was much less relevant than today. It is, however, our hope that NYSE's industry comprehensive restructuring proposal will gather momentum in light of the Treasury's report, and we've been pleased that a large number of buy-side firms have already reached out to us to talk about its efficacy. So, we're open to seeing further shifts of revenue away from our realtime products to our SIP revenue stream if our package proposal can be advanced to improve the overall market structure for end-users. And we don't believe our shareholders should be concerned about this idea, as our overall data business remains on track to post the robust 6% growth that we've anticipated, despite any headlines surrounding less meaningful realtime U.S. equity data. So, whether in the U.S. with efforts to rationalize regulation or in Europe with the upcoming implementation of MiFID II, we continue to find opportunity within regulatory change. This is why we have 6 clearing houses across the globe on common technologies. This is why we have 12 trading venues. It's why we have a data and analytics business serving the major asset classes, and it's why we have multiple solutions to deliver and distribute these capabilities to our customers around the world. So, as you could see on this Slide 14, we've uniquely grown earnings over the past 11 years, and in each of the past 11 years through both economic cycles and regulatory changes. And we're confident that we'll continue to build on this track record that you see here as we begin to look to 2018 and beyond. So, I'd like to thank our customers for their business in the quarter and recognize my colleagues for their effort to producing another strong quarter of growth. I would also like to welcome the Bank of America Merrill Lynch index team to ICE, and I look forward to soon welcoming the teams from BondPoint and NGX Shorcan. I'll now turn the call back to our moderator, Jamie, to conduct the question-and-answer session, which will run until the bell rings at 9 :30 Eastern Time. Operator : With that ladies and gentlemen, we'll begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] And our first question today comes from Rich Repetto from Sandler O'Neill. Sir, please go ahead with your question. Rich Repetto : Yeah. Good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Scott. Jeff Sprecher : Good morning, Rich. Rich Repetto : I guess, just a follow-up on the market data discussion. First, a more detailed question and I think you alluded to this, Scott, but why did the exchange data drop quarter-to-quarter? You said something about the demand for realtime data. And then more broadly, Jeff, I guess, if realtime proprietary feeds are only 4%, I guess, I'm trying to distinguish, so you've got probably $75 million to $100 million of tape revenue, and then this 4% from proprietary, is that the entire realtime data exposure you have to equities? Jeff Sprecher : Yes. Let me answer that second part first. So, we, and all exchanges and all price discovery venues and dark pools, can contribute data to the SIP. And there's -- that is a highly regulated venue that has its own sales force and its own operations. And we participate in a pro-rata piece of that, along with the rest of the industry. And that is, Scott, help me here, maybe $120 million or something in revenue for us, plus or minus. And then there is this separate bucket that seems to be the one that gets a lot of attention, which is basically proprietary feeds and realtime information that we sell outside of the SIP, which is probably less than $90 million this year. We've got a proposal out there that we think there should be a single point of truth for what is the value of a stock in the marketplace. And if that single point of truth would enure to the SIP, that would be fine with us as part of a package of reforms that would go along to bolster confidence in the market and protect the process of price discovery for end-users. Scott Hill : And then, Rich, to your specific question, you may recall in the last earnings call, I mentioned that we had an audit that resulted in some revenues in the second quarter that I had originally expected in the third quarter. I noted that second quarter was therefore a bit elevated. So that's what the dip is quarter-to-quarter. Jeff Sprecher : And, Rich, yes, the -- what is going on that's causing this? I mentioned in my prepared comments that there was a lot of angst as the industry was moving to Regulation NMS. And basically, was a forced fragmentation of the market by reducing the barriers to entry, there were a lot of parts in motion. And there were people, there were haves and have-nots in that environment, and there were arbitrage opportunities that high-speed traders were able to exploit. Over time, what's happened is that the exchanges like NYSE have gotten more sophisticated in the way we run our platforms to take out arbitrage. We've been able to time markets. We measure cables, work with networks and so on and so forth that has essentially taken the flash boys type of behavior out of the markets, in my opinion. And as a result, people that want realtime data directly from the exchange or simply looking for a breadth of products that we offer that are not available on the SIP, in addition to what you can get from the SIP. And the demand for that is stagnant and has been relatively stagnant for quite some time. So, I feel like the controversy around this is a legacy issue that's been going on for a long time, and we're still debating the flash boys mentality in a world where I don't believe that the same dynamics exist today. Rich Repetto : Jeff, just to move on from the market data, just one follow-up. Literally, I think within the last hour, the Bank of England raised the rates -- their interest rates for the first time in, I think, since the financial crisis. And I'm just trying to get your interest rate volume spike in September, but they came off in October, I guess, getting your broad outlook on the interest rate complex going forward. Scott Hill : Yes. So Rich, I'll take this, and if Jeff wants to supplement. He certainly can, but this is the reason why I highlighted in my remarks that open interest across all our products is up 11% year-over-year at the end of October. Interest rates, in particular the open interest levels, are high. And what we've contended consistently over time is that's what you need to pay attention to. Because if open interest is up, that means the market's paying attention. And when you get volatility, it drives volumes. And so, if you think about what the Central Banks are doing now, you've got the European Central Bank that said it's going to slow buying. You've got to the U.S. Federal Reserve that's come out and said they're going to move in December. And now you've got the Bank of England who voted seven to two to raise their interest rates, I think somewhere between 25 and 50 basis points. All of that -- I'm not predicting that all happened in November, but it certainly said that elevated open interest levels, interest rate volumes should respond. And I think importantly, I would note that our rates consistently respond to all three of those dynamics. So, it's not uniquely a U.S. movement. It's not uniquely a U.K. movement. Our European and U.K. rates move relative to all that Central Bank activity. And so, again, not predicting a particular month, but as I look forward with the Central Banks starting to move, I like the prospects of our interest rate business with open interest where it is. Rich Repetto : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Kramm from UBS. Please go ahead with your question. Alex Kramm : Hey. Good morning. Just maybe I think the one thing that you didn't really highlight a lot about was the Euroclear stake purchase here, Jeff. Maybe you can talk a little bit more about this. I think historically, you've shied away, maybe other than Cetip, from like buying some minority investments. So how do you think about that investment going forward? Could we upsize that? And then even if you don't upsize that, like what does it get you? What does it -- the seat of the table get you for your overall business over the next 2 years? Jeff Sprecher : Well, thanks for the question, and thanks for acknowledging that we typically don't buy minority stakes. We don't really view that our role as managing the shareholders' capital is to act as a venture capital firm. We believe people can do that better than we can. But where we have bought minority stakes, and we've done a number of them, we've bought a minority stake in the Climate Exchange in the early days of the movement of Climate. We bought a minority stake, as you mentioned, in Cetip, and a lot of changes going on in Brazil. And now we're buying a minority stake in Euroclear. At a moment in time when we think there's a lot of change going on in -- both in Europe and with respect to custody in terms of bank capital requirements and other pressures that are being put on the industry for cost. So, this stake allows us to have a closer relationship with the board and management of the company, and we believe that there will be a number of initiatives that we could work on jointly together in that context. That work -- that type of investment works very well for us in Brazil, where we jointly launched the bond platform with Cetip, which we still are a stakeholder in and which is doing very, very well. And so, we've already begun engaging in conversation with Euroclear management to try to set the table for some things that we could do together that would be jointly beneficial. Alex Kramm : Great. And then just secondly, maybe a little bit of -- a little bigger picture. Jeff, I think you ended your prepared remarks today on the slide with a consistent growth over time, which has obviously been impressive. And I think over the years, you've laid out that algorithm that gets you to double-digit earnings growth most recently at the Investor Day. But look at this year, unfortunately, given where consensus is and how the quarter is shaping up so far 4Q in terms of volumes, it looks like you maybe be falling short a little bit maybe like mid-single digits or so. So, I guess, the question is, first of all, can you identify like what the biggest areas where that didn't work this year, even though you took out synergies, et cetera? And then going forward, like how -- why should we have more confidence next year? And does this highlight also that we may have to do some larger-scale M&A again to juice the growth rates a little bit to get to that acceptable rate for you? Jeff Sprecher : Sure. Look, I think as management here, we believe that it's our job to deliver value for shareholders, and that our job is to deliver earnings growth and earnings per share growth specifically. So, we take that seriously. It's how we're compensated. It's how the culture of the company is developed. And I'm pretty confident that over the long term, we can continue to do that. We don't run the business quarter-to-quarter. But more, I think, than most companies in our space, we will buy businesses, and we will sell businesses. And we will curate what we do, and we'll continue to evolve the company to move into areas of growth. And I think the recent acquisitions that we've done, particularly buying IDC and the index business from -- fixed income from S&P and the index business from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, these are all assets that we're putting together in this new data space, which we believe really will be a growth driver for the next few years. It's early days for us in this area, as you know, but we've been amazingly positively surprised by the reception that we're getting. And we do think that it will be a long-term driver of growth for us. Alex Kramm : All right. Very good. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Alex Blostein : Hey. Good morning, guys. Jeff Sprecher : Good morning. Alex Blostein : Question with respect to a couple of recent deals you guys have done, one more clarification question. But I guess, Scott, with respect to BAML, I just want to make sure I got this. So, $480 million or so in expenses in Q4. I'm assuming that includes the expenses associated with BAML index business. Can you give us the revenue contribution there as well? And I guess, bigger picture, maybe just a couple of comments on how that business has grown recently. And how does the ownership of BAML index business by ICE could overall kind of enhance the offering there? Scott Hill : Yes. so, I'll let Jeff answer the second half of the question. But I'll just start with given when BAML closed, the $480 million of expense does include it. It's a very small number, and it's a very small impact of revenue for the quarter. And so, I would call it immaterial for the quarter. And then as we move into 2018, as I noted on our fourth quarter earnings call, I'll give you guys an update on that deal, plus the other two, assuming they close in time to let you know what '18 is. But for the quarter, yes, it's in the expense, but it doesn't move the needle, and revenue is also very small. Jeff Sprecher : And now just some commentary. Historically, index businesses that existed inside banks and trading firms were there to help facilitate trading, not to necessarily independently grow the index business. And by extracting that business now, it gives us an opportunity to actually put time and resources behind it and actually grow it as a business for both revenue and earnings. And it is an amazing complex, in that when you combine it with everything else, we now have the second-largest fixed income complex. And more importantly, for us, we have a lot of underlying data, reference data, pricing data, other proprietary tools that we have that just are additive when you can walk into a customer that is using those indices. So, whether we ultimately monetize the Bank of America Merrill Lynch indices directly or whether we monetize it by providing underlying tools, such as data, reference data and analytics, is part of the package that I mentioned of solutions that we can bring to the market, that give us a lot of flexibility to end-users. At a moment in time when there's a lot of self-indexing going on and pressure on index costs and so on and so forth, we think we can grow our franchise really well in that environment. Alex Blostein : Got it. And then the second question, just again, also more strategic. So, thinking through the credit trading dynamic, you guys earlier this year announced you'll start to -- you'll try to get bigger in the dealer-to-dealer space in terms of bond trading. You obviously still have the CDS business. You bought BondPoint, given your exit to retail. Can you tie these pieces together for us? Again, I'm just thinking through your bigger-picture aspirations in credit trading. Jeff Sprecher : Sure. I mean, really, what BondPoint brings to our current infrastructure is a different client base. BondPoint is a dealer to end-user wealth manager platform, and those people are not historically in the ICE ecosystem. So, it allows us to bring that client base in to not only the BondPoint trading, but to our analytics, data sales network connectivity services, desktops, so on and so forth that we are assembling around the fixed income space. I think it will be very additive. I think if you see BondPoint from the data we've put in the deck, the size of trades on BondPoint are growing. The viewership of BondPoint is growing. And having an inner dealer platform right now, i.e. the wholesale markets, this gives us essentially a dealer-to-client footprint, which is the retail market. And we think those two will work well together, particularly given the direction that regulation is going in the bond space, which is pushing things towards more transparency, but also protecting the inventory capabilities seemingly of the dealers in terms of liquidity that they will be able to provide long-term to the market. Alex Blostein : Great. Thanks very much. Jeff Sprecher : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question. Ken Worthington : Hi. Thank you. In terms of data, the U.S. business is big and growing a bit more slowly, and Asia is small and growing really fast, but it seems like Europe is big and growing fast, and that may be the most interesting. So, can you flush out further which buckets you see as the big drivers of growth in Europe, maybe just compare it to the U.S.? In your release you use exchange data versus analytics and versus connectivity. And then maybe discuss the broader themes and drivers of growth in Europe. So obviously, MiFID seems to be playing out here. But maybe talk about MiFID and, more specifically, how that drives data usage and growth for you versus other trends across the pond? Jeff Sprecher : Sure. Well, you've read our data correctly, in that the U.S. is a big market. It's an important marketplace. It's more advanced in terms right now of how it's consuming data and the real growth opportunities that we're seeing lay outside of the United States. And MiFID is a big driver of Europe. It -- and while people are looking for compliance tools specifically to meet the regulatory text of MiFID, MiFID, and in combination with Brexit, is also providing a nucleus for a longer-term change that's going on in the way asset managers do business, in the way that money is managed and the locations on where that's being done. And so, we think there is going to be a multi-year trend going on through Europe of change, of where workflow is going to be modified. Transparency's going to come in. Accountability in terms of end-user documentation and discovery is going to be increased. And to a certain degree, our large global clients are telling us that they may export some of those techniques, both to the U.S. and to Asia. And so, we think out of that for the data sales, if you will. Asia is just -- is really growing off a very small base, but it is the trend that we all see for Asia, more sophistication and money management, more ability to access global markets, more ability to manage wealth and risk within the region. And so, we've been investing a lot in the way we organize in Asia, the way we've got connectivity to Asia and so on and so forth. The U.S. is a bit of a transition period. The U.S. is going through a pendulum change under the current administration on how regulation is going to be interpreted. There's a lot of unknowns, if you will. There's obviously a lack of volatility, particularly in U.S. equities, that may be a drag on those markets. But I think, again, those are short-term cyclical issues. Scott Hill : The other thing to keep in mind, Ken, is Jeff talked about the realtime cash equities data, and I mentioned it was down 6%; the tape revenue down a similar amount, 5% to 6%. Almost 90%, if not a little more than that, hits the Americas and not the other two regions. And so that impact's a little bit more poignant in the Americas than it is anywhere else. Ken Worthington : Fair enough. And then just separately, Scott, how are you thinking about CapEx and capitalized software spending next year? Any big changes, up or down, versus what we are experiencing this year? Jeff Sprecher : Yes. So, we've given you that CapEx, Ken, in a couple of buckets. And I'm saying this in advance of our budget with our board, which we'll do later this year. But my early indications are the real estate CapEx, which I think we've noted would be $50 million this year, that will definitely be coming down as we move into '18. And I expect our operating CapEx will be somewhere between flat to down a little bit. So, we clearly have been making investments at 11 Wall for our listed companies and building out IDC in the pillar rollout this year. Some of that, particularly in IDC, that buildout will continue as we move through next year. But I think the general trend is down from an '18 versus '17 standpoint. Ken Worthington : Awesome. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeremy Campbell from Barclays. Jeremy Campbell : Thanks. On the self-indexing side, ICE had a small win, as several State Street SPDR ETFs cut fees because they dropped Russell and moved to a provider index that ICE support. But I guess, big picture, do you think the index branding is a bit more important on the equity ETF side with like Russell, S&P, MSCI, than it might be for fixed income? And kind of given your holistic fixed income offering that you discussed in your prepared remarks, how do you think about the addressable market and maybe some of the timing for getting further traction in that index solution-type business? Jeff Sprecher : It's a good question. I mean, when you think about the conversations we're having about the demand for U.S. realtime equity data, you see it being diminished. And most indices that we think about are equity indices. It's simply taking a basket of stocks and just grabbing those prices and in realtime calculating. So, it's a math project. There's very little -- that equity data is somewhat ubiquitous, available in a lot of places. Those indices in equities are -- have very little intellectual property around them, except for a few milestone indexes that the global industry uses to benchmark whatever else they do on a self-index basis. Fixed income is very different. When you think about any kind of an index, the life of a fixed income instrument is short. People do 5-year loans and retire them. People refinance loans and bonds. So that index needs sort of constant care and feeding for replacement and rebalancing. The underlying data is hard to get, both the reference data -- in other words, what is the legal name of the entity? When is the bond going to be redeemed? What opportunities are there for early redemption and penalties, so on and so forth? That reference data has to be underpinned as a foundation to any index, as does the pricing, which most of the fixed income instruments don't trade. So, pricing has to be discovered through related instruments, algorithms, other derivatives that you can back into rational pricing. So, there's much more intellectual property that goes into the construction of a fixed income index. And that's where we have been focusing. If you look at the acquisitions we've made with S&P, with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, with IDC, all of it is targeted towards having a holistic platform that really works in that fixed income space. Boy, anyone that owns one of the major global equity indices, congratulations to them. But whether or not the rest of the family of indices that they have, have much brand equity becomes much less obvious that you can continue to charge an AUM base fee for those. Jeremy Campbell : Got it. And then maybe, Scott, regarding the Trayport sale, how much of the proceeds were kind of already allocated to the recent investments and acquisitions you made, and maybe the upsize buyback versus what's maybe kind of freed up for future M&A or capital returns? Scott Hill : So, the way I would think about it is the Trayport proceeds and the proceeds paid for the other acquisitions are all kind of in one bucket. Any incremental amount above the Trayport proceeds we financed through debt, which had a very small, as I indicated, impact on leverage. And our objective, as we move into 2018, remains that we'll return 100% of the capital we don't need for forward-looking deals. And that's why you saw us bump our share repurchase authorization and our board bump our share repurchase authorization by 20%. So, I would think of the deals as a collective that we did in October with any incremental on leverage. And our share returns or our capital return policies as we move forward is to continue to grow it as we grow. And I think you saw in the share repurchase authorization, we're well positioned to do that. Jeremy Campbell : Great. Thanks a lot guys. Jeff Sprecher : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks very much. Maybe just some clarification, and sorry if I missed this, but of the pro forma revenue from the new acquisitions, the $93 million, how much of that was from BondPoint? I know you gave a good breakout on Slide 12 of the composition. I'm just trying to sort of gauge the size of it. And it looks like the volumes almost triple what you have currently in ICE credit trade. So, I just wanted to confirm that, and if you think that 40% CAGR over the last 2 years, or '16 to '17, is sustainable near term. Scott Hill : Yes. So, we haven't provided -- we gave you an aggregate of what the deals look like on a trailing 12-month basis. As I suspect you would expect, a big portion of those revenues are related to BondPoint. I'll give you more specifics with regards to '18 guidance once we have it. Again, the chart on '16 was just for indicative purposes to make, frankly, the point that all the deals net out to not a really material impact on our business. But again, more specifics to come when we have our fourth quarter earnings call. I think with regard to whether or not we think we could continue to grow the BondPoint business, I don't think there's any doubt. Number one, I think the business itself was well positioned, particularly in the corporate and the muni space. As you saw on Chart 12 that Jeff walked through, it's been strong growth. I think on a standalone basis, it could continue to grow. But more importantly, we have the opportunity for our dealer-to-dealer platform and the customers on that and the retail brokers, the wealth managers, et cetera, on BondPoint to cross-pollinate the different platforms. And so, it's a situation where we bought a business we think can continue to grow well by itself, but that we think we can grow faster once we put all our assets together. Brian Bedell : And am I correct in that? Is that about 3x the size of ICE -- of the current ICE credit trade? Scott Hill : I haven't looked at it in that way, but it wouldn't surprise me if it's something of that magnitude. Brian Bedell : And then just back on data. I think at Investor Day, you were talking about, and I know this is very hypothetical in the long-term, but pricing is about 30% of the driver for the increase in long-term data revenues. Are you still sticking by that with some of the potential pressure on U.S. cash equities data? And how would, I guess, you make up for that if that's a lower number? Scott Hill : That's a really good question, and I appreciate you asking it. Look, I think the point that Jeff made, and I'll reiterate it, is that realtime cash equities data, even in our data business, is less than 4%. And so, the model we showed you in June is the model we believe we can execute. I look at last year, mid- to high-single digits. Last year, we grew 7%. This year, we're going to grow 6%. ASV, kind of our forward-looking metric organically, is at 6%. So yes, we feel very confident about the model. I think the elements are all directionally correct. As I said at Investor Day, in any given year, one may be a little bit more, a little bit less. For example, as we sit here today, our number next year is not going to benefit from acquisitions. But again, we're confident of where it will be organically. So yes, look, I think the pricing element is right in the medium and longer term. In any given year, I think it can vary, but I absolutely don't think the impacts of the realtime cash equities business are going to be a big differentiator inside the model or inside our growth. Jeff Sprecher : And let me just -- we're providing more transparency in this call because we've been getting a lot of questions about realtime NYSE data. But we've owned the NYSE since 2013, so this is not -- the dynamics around realtime NYSE data are not new to us. And so, this has all been baked into the guidance that we've been giving you, the way we've been operating the business and so on and so forth. It is a high-profile topic. It is a low-profile issue within the management of this company because we are a company that is looking for change that is driving growth. And it is not in that space. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks very much for the color. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Carrier from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question. Michael Carrier : Thanks. Good morning. Jeff, maybe just on the fixed income or the credit part of the business. Yes, so when I look at ICE, you guys have CDS. Now you've got BondPoint. You've got the data part with IDC. So just trying to understand, when you look at that opportunity, like what other maybe like pieces are you missing to kind of build that out, whether it's from a client standpoint or a client-end standpoint to really maybe be able to attract that opportunity? Jeff Sprecher : It's a good question. I think the footprint that we have given us everything we need. That doesn't mean that we won't be opportunistic if things came along. I said on this call about a year ago that I thought that the future was going to be a lot more bolt-on acquisitions for our company just given the global trends that are going on in the market. And I still stand by that today. There may be interesting things, and we're in a great position from the way Scott's been managing cash, to be able to execute quickly on M&A opportunities as they come up. But we have a really strong team, Lynn Martin in Data; and Chris Edmonds, who oversees financial products; and Stan Ivanov, who oversees our credit CDS business, have all been working together with Scott and Chuck and I on how we can bring all of this together and really make an interesting offering. And I've said a number of times on this call that I've been surprised how quickly the market has responded to some of the things we've brought out, the positive feedback we've been getting. I have a meeting in the next couple of days with the most senior management of one of the big buy-side firms that is talking to us about how can we do more together. And so, I've never had that kind of conversation with these people in the history of the company. And so, I really do feel like we've had -- have a really good platform to bring together, but that doesn't mean we won't find things along the way that can really supercharge and enhance it. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Harris from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question. Chris Harris : Thanks guys. Another one on data. Thanks for the incremental disclosure. I guess, we're saying that U.S. equity prop is $25 million of revenue for you. NASDAQ disclosed that they have $100 million of U.S. equity prop data rev. So, I'm curious as to why NASDAQ might have so much more than NYSE in that area. And then a related question to that would be, if nothing happens on the regulatory side of things as it relates to data, might it be actually be an opportunity for you to narrow the gap between you and NASDAQ in this area? Scott Hill : So, let me just start on a quick key check. So, from a numbers standpoint, what Jeff alluded to in the script was for a full year, the realtime cash equity is less than $90 million. So, I'm not sure what the $25 million number is. And then he went on to say later that our tape data was around $120 million in total. And so, I don't think if you go back and check those against what's the disclosure, you're going to find them to be that different. Jeff Sprecher : Yes. And with respect to the market dynamics, there are a lot of competitors in the space that take realtime feeds from exchanges and what-have-you basically create a private-label version of the SIP. And that was interesting in a market dynamic where people were worried about the time that it took to see information. And as I mentioned, over time, exchanges -- we've changed our systems to try to take any latency and arbitrage capability out of individual servers, individual NIC cards, individual cables, software upgrades, I mean, you name it. There have been years now of markets making sure that, from a pure technology standpoint, the playing field is level. So, having the opportunity for a private-label SIP, when you've got a SIP that has price regulation and a lot of investment to improve it, is probably not a huge opportunity. NYSE never did a particularly potent job of moving into that space. It's probably, in retrospect, not a bad thing because I'm not sure it's a growth area for this management team to pursue. I do think that if you run a grocery store, you've got to have milk, butter and eggs if you're going to sell the high-priced rotisserie chicken. And so, NYSE data is milk, butter and eggs. And what are Scott and I and Chuck doing? We're making rotisserie chicken. So, I don't want to necessarily say that you don't want to have it, but I'm not sure that that's where you want to invest. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Allen from Rosenblatt. Please go ahead with your question. Chris Allen : Good morning, guys. Just wanted to touch on credit again. Greenwich Associates have recently published a paper talking about the evolution of corporate bond trading, and the conclusion was they expected to see bond trading venues more authentic data than analyst providers moving forward when your liquidity pools as the foundation of the business. I would argue you guys have a little bit of different tact just with the IDC capabilities, and now it looks like you're building a liquidity pool. So, any color in terms of how you think the bond markets evolve? Only 20% of us trade electronically right now, where do you think that can get to? And how do you think you can marry your data capabilities? A little bit more depths or color there with the trading venues. Jeff Sprecher : Yes. Well, bear in mind, at least in the U.S. and now coming into Europe, you have this notion of a publicly disseminated tape, the trace tape in the U.S. And so, there is bond transparency that all data providers can work off of. And then ICE can supplement that with realtime pricing that we're getting from other relationships that we have with realtime pricing we're getting from, in other words, from buy-side customers, realtime pricing we get from our own platforms, realtime pricing that we get through our CDS and credit vehicles. So, we have a lot of data that floats around here that we think will actually help facilitate trading. And in the holistic circle that we always like to talk about, if we can have better transparency, we think it will facilitate more trading and, ultimately, more clearing and more data dissemination, and then more network capabilities and analytics and so on and so forth. So, I don't think it's any one part of that drives the other. I think it's a transitional change that the market's going through. And whether we like it or not, fixed income are relatively illiquid instruments. And so, they, at the margin, are going to need a lot of help to be electronified and I think we're well positioned because we have tools that can provide a lot of help. And that's why we're investing in the space. Operator : And our next question comes from Kyle Voigt from KBW. Please go ahead with your question. Kyle Voigt : Hi. Okay. Maybe just one follow-up on MiFID II. Just wondering if we could get some updated thoughts here on the derivatives side. I'm just wondering if you're planning to take advantage of the 30-month delay for open access that's available for exchange-traded derivatives venues. And maybe some just updated thoughts on how you see open access playing out over the coming years in terms of the potential for fragmentation. Jeff Sprecher : Sure. Well, there's an interesting conversation going on in Europe right now between most of the major exchanges and most of the major regulators over whether or not MiFID II works in an environment where you have a Brexit. If you think of MiFID II as being essentially forced fragmentation of markets in order to stimulate competition, you've got this overlay now of a population that voted for fragmentation. And is there still a role right now for government to implement forced fragmentation when the market itself is fragmenting the market in ways that none of us sitting here today can fully comprehend. And so, there is an active dialogue going on amongst regulators and market participants about that 30-month delay and how that could be implemented potentially across the Brexit negotiation. We'll just have to wait and see where that comes out and what the outcome of that is. But you do see, for the first time, certain people in Europe suggesting that maybe that provision of MiFID is potentially ill-conceived in the current environment. And not knowing where financial services companies and customers are going to land post-Brexit further complicates regulatory and political oversight. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, at that time, we have reached the end of today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference call back over to management for any closing remark. Jeff Sprecher : Thank you, Jamie, and thanks, all of you, for joining us today. And we look forward to continuing to update you as we close out the year and as we continue to build on the track record of growth within the company. Have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Warren Gardiner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Warren Gardiner : Good morning. ICE\u2019s fourth quarter 2017 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today\u2019s call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of these risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2017 Form 10-K which we filed this morning. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including adjusted income, operating margin, expenses, EPS, EBITDA and tax rate. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You will find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP term in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information being meaningful as well as how management uses these measures in our Form 10-K. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Also with us on the call are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and joining us for the first time and available for Q&A will be Ben Jackson, our President. I will now turn the call over to Scott. Scott Hill : Thanks, Warren. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I will start on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our fourth quarter. ICE\u2019s consolidated fourth quarter net revenues increased 1% to $1.1 billion. Data revenues increased 2% as reported and grew 5% on an organic constant currency basis, while trading and clearing revenues were flat versus the prior period. Adjusted operating expenses were down 3% year-over-year to $479 million and adjusted operating margins expanded to 58%. Importantly, we delivered over $70 million in synergies in 2017 and as I will discuss later, we expect to generate around half of the remaining $60 million in synergies during 2018. The combination of top line growth and margin expansions generated fourth quarter earnings of $0.73 per share, which was up 3% from last year\u2019s fourth quarter and contributed to full year earnings growth of 6%. Our strong earnings generated nearly $2.1 billion of operating cash flow in 2017. Cash flows were down slightly from 2016, but that was primarily due to our proactive move to use $136 million to fully fund the legacy NYSE pension plan. We have now largely eliminated any future pension liability. In addition by taking the action in advance of corporate tax reform, we realized an incremental cash tax savings of nearly $20 million related to the higher federal tax rates in 2017. We leveraged our strong cash generations to return a record $1.4 billion to our shareholders, which you can you see in more detail on Slide 5. During 2017, we repurchased $949 million of our stock at an average price of just over $63 versus the 12/31 closing price of nearly $71. And even as we returned to record level of capital to our shareholders, we also achieved our leverage target ahead of schedule and continued to invest in both organic growth and strategic M&A, including the Bank of America/Merrill Lynch indices, Euroclear, NGX and BondPoint. It\u2019s worth pausing to note here that the combinations of assets we have acquired and divested during 2016 and 2017 will increase our revenues by over $30 million and reduced our expenses by around $25 million in 2018 versus our pro forma 2015 results. With our profits continuing to grow and CapEx needs shrinking, 2018 sets up as another solid year for cash generation and capital return. We entered the year with $1.2 billion share repurchase authorization, which is 20% higher than our prior authorization. And this morning we announced our first quarter dividend of $0.24 per share, which is 20% higher than a year ago. Now let\u2019s move to Slide 6 where I will discuss our data and listings segment. In the fourth quarter, segment revenues grew 5% year-over-year on an organic constant currency basis and our best in class operating margins expanded to 51%. Organic growth in our listings business was up 3% in the fourth quarter. Given our outstanding listings performance in 2017 as well as a very strong start in January, we expect organic growth in listings revenue excluding the impact of the sale of NYSE Governance Services to accelerate to 5% to 6% growth in 2018. In our data services business, organic constant currency growth was 5% in the quarter with balance growth across all business lines. Of note, fourth quarter results were reduced by around $4 million due to the sale of Trayport on December 14. I will provide some additional insights regarding our data services business on Slide 7. We entered the first quarter of 2018 with an organic ASV is up 6% year-over-year and new signings across our pricing and analytics business that increased 12% in 2017. Importantly, roughly 40% of our 2017 pricing and analytics sales were attributable to innovative new products such as our continuous evaluated pricing services, our reference data products and our index offerings. We expect this enhanced product lineup, strong signings and high customer retentions to generate organic growth in pricing and analytics greater than 7% in 2018. This is an acceleration from 5% growth in 2017, 3.5% growth in 2016 and the 2% to 3% growth at IDC prior to our acquisition in 2015. Our thesis when we acquired IDC was that a renewed focus on customers and product innovations would significantly accelerate revenue growth. That thesis is proving out. We are also seeing very strong growth in our connectivity and feeds business. The customers increased their capacity on our network by 20% in 2017, which contributed to revenues that grew over 7% organically for the year and we expect a double digit growth in capacity and strong revenue growth to repeat in 2018. The strong growth in pricing in analytics as well as connectivity indeed were more than offset slower growth in our exchange data and should contribute to overall organic data revenue growth consistent with the longer term outlook we provided to you at our Investor Day in June. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 8, where I will review our trading and clearing segment. Revenues were flat year-to-year in the fourth quarter, while segment operating margins expanded to 67%. Despite a 2% decline in average daily volume for commodities, our revenues increased by 2% year-over-year supported by a resilient RPC which benefited from favorable product mix and our commercial customer orientation. We continue to build on that growth in 2018 with January total futures and options volumes up 12% year-over-year. This growth was led by strength in interest rates which were up 28% year-over-year and ads which were up 17% year-over-year. Open interest trend also remained strong with overall OI up 12% year-over-year. Moving next to Slide 9, you can see the positive trends across our trading and clearing segment. Average daily volume in our futures and options business increased by 10% in 2017 and this was on top of 8% growth in 2016. Our 2017 growth was led by a 15% year-over-year increase in our Brent franchise, which notched its 21st consecutive year of record volumes. Our European and UK interest rate volumes increased 28% for the highest level since 2013. More importantly, open interest across the platform increased 11% in 2017 with oil OI up 8% and rates OI up 38%. Open interest is an important indicator of customer demand and future growth across our markets. And as I just noted we are benefiting from high open interest with a solid start of the year in January and the early days of February despite some temporary uncertainty created by the implementation of MiFID II. I will wrap up my remarks on Slide 10 with a preview of 2018. As I noted earlier in our data business, we entered 2018 with organic ASV up 6% year-over-year and strong momentum in our pricing and analytics and connectivity and feeds business. The ASV metrics combined with our consistently high customer retention, new products and improving sales efficiency supports our view that 2018 organic data revenue growth will accelerate to between 6% and 7%. We have provided Slide 17 in the appendix to help establish the organic revenue base for 2018. The strength of our data revenues accelerated growth in our listings business as well as growing open interest in revenue capture trends in our trading and clearing segment all bodes well for another year of solid top line growth in 2018. That revenue growth coupled with margin expansion, tax reform and capital expenditures, which we expect to be down by 10% year-over-year should make 2018 another strong year for capital return. As I mentioned this morning, we announced a 20% increase in our first quarter dividend and in January we already deployed $100 million of that $1.2 billion repurchase authorization. I will turn next to expenses. We expect expenses in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion for 2018. This includes $30 million of the remaining $60 million in IDC synergies. When we report our first quarter results, you will see our 2017 compensation expenses restated to reflect the change in the GAAP accounting rules related to pensions. The full year impact will increase 2017 expenses by just under $10 million and 2018 comps will be accounted for in a consistent manner. FX, as well as the small net impact from our various acquisitions and divestitures will add around $15 million in expenses in 2018, but are also expected to increase revenues by over $40 million. In addition, similar to 2017, we expect to see variable expenses which are directly associated with revenue growth increased by around $20 million. Next, we will invest $35 million to $40 million in our employees through increased merit-based compensation and cash performance bonuses in 2018. And finally, in light of the recent change in U.S. tax laws, we expect our tax rate to fall to somewhere between 22% and 25%, which should add around $150 million to $200 million to our net income and cash flow. We intend to reinvest $30 million to $35 million of those savings during 2018 to further strengthen our cyber capabilities and our technology and operations footprint. This investment will support the development and future growth of our fixed income indices, our reference data offerings, MERS, BondPoint and our Safety network. We do not anticipate a similar level of incremental investment to be required in future years and the majority of the tax savings will still drop to the bottom line. With that, I will be happy to take your questions during Q&A, but for now, I will turn it over to Jeff. Jeff Sprecher : Thank you, Scott and good morning to everyone on the call. I will begin on Slide 11. 2017 marked another year of solid revenue growth, margin expansion, rising capital return and for the 12th consecutive year record adjusted earnings. We have achieved this growth through bull markets and bear markets through periods of elevated volatility and muted volatility as well as through regulatory change and ever evolving customer needs. We credit this track record of growth to a consistent vision, which is to uncover and dissolve for inefficiencies across markets, while enhancing the workflows of our customers. As our platform has expanded, our opportunity and ability to execute on this vision has grown with it. We benefit from an execution business that now spans all major asset classes and operates across multiple jurisdictions. It\u2019s complemented by a subscription-based data business that is critical to our customers\u2019 workflows, one with a proven ability to generate consistent and compounding growth through various business cycles. Combined with our efficient cost structure, we deliver a consistent high-quality cash flow that provides us with the visibility and competence to continually invest in our future growth while increasing capital return to our shareholders. As you can see on Slide 12, this unique model was supported by a foundation of some of the world\u2019s deepest liquidity pools in its most important markets. We operate the world\u2019s largest energy market, the largest venue for European and UK interest rate trading and we are the global leader in corporate listings. We do this by levering our 7 clearinghouses and 12 exchanges across 5 major market centers. This comprises the world\u2019s largest and most flexible trading and risk management infrastructure, which drives a comprehensive suite of data and connectivity services. Our vast infrastructure is critical to linking participants around the world to the markets and information that they require to manage risk everyday. Moving to Slide 13, in our energy markets, we are building on our position as the premier global energy platform. Revenues in our energy business topped $900 million for the first time ever in 2017 driven by a year of record energy volumes. And our Brent oil complex recorded its 21st year of volume as commercial customers increasingly rely on our platform to help meet their global hedging needs. As you can see, 2018 is off to a strong start building on our track record of growth upon growth. Open interest in our oil markets is up 9% year-over-year, with Brent futures hitting a new record in late January as investment in North Sea oilfields continues. Similarly, in our Gasoil capital markets, average volumes are up 19% year-over-year as demand for diesel fuel rises on the back of an improving European and Asian economy. And given the Gasoil is a byproduct of a barrel of Brent crude oil, growth in our Gasoil business is generally a positive leading indicator for our Brent franchise. Notably, the extreme U.S. winter weather to start the year and the transitory market reports such as the surprise WTI inventory draw reported in January provided more speculative trading opportunities in the benchmark energy contracts of WTI and Henry Hub. While we benefited from the moves in these products, these types of trends tend to be transient in nature and not structural. Because we cater to a largely commercial customer base by offering a complete range of global energy contracts, our energy markets tend to be less cyclical in nature with an upward growth biased over the long-term. Also in January, Europe implemented MiFID II\u2019s position limit and reporting regimes. While these created short-term challenges for many of our commodity customers, particularly in the month of December and through the first few weeks of January, these market concerns have now quieted as we found regulators to be receptive to our customers\u2019 concerns. In fact, the UK\u2019s FCA has processed over 1,000 hedge exemption applications, many of which were filed at the last minute to bring clarity to our customers. And as you can see, our crude oil market share has rebounded accordingly compared to the first few weeks of the year. Again, this was a transient versus structural moment. Shifting to our longstanding global natural gas strategy, we continue to make progress on many fronts. In our North American markets, we operate the leading venue for natural gas basis trading, providing liquidity and hedging for over 100 gas delivery hubs. Given the structural changes in natural gas exploration in North America, we see signs that some of the large commercial customers are shifting away from hedging with the benchmark Henry Hub contract and are moving business into these regional basis markets. And this was demonstrated by record volume and open interest in our natural gas basis markets in January. The newest addition to our strategic natural gas efforts is our acquisition of NGX in December. It brings us additional trading, clearing and physical settlement solutions, enhancing our leading North American position. And when coupled with our European and UK natural gas contracts, we now offer a full range of trading and hedging tools across international markets, a service that our commercial customers view as increasingly important as this asset class continues to globalize. Turning now to Slide 14, as we move into 2018 and look for ways to leverage our multi-asset class platform, there are many secular trends upon which we continue to capitalize. In the fixed income markets, we are creating an expanded platform that\u2019s designed to facilitate the efficiency and information increasingly sought by market participants. The fixed income market is one of the largest investable asset classes in the world with a market structure that is early in its transition from analog to digital workflow. We have assembled a unique suite of assets to help facilitate this evolution, while addressing specific customer needs along the way. We are a leading provider of independent fixed income pricing. We have a global reference data business that spans 11 million instruments across 145 countries. We have widely used fixed income analytics critical to our customers risk and inventory management work flows. We are now the second largest fixed income index provider following our fourth quarter acquisition of the Bank of America/Merrill Lynch index suite, offering over 5,000 unique indices. And at the start of 2018 we closed on our acquisition of BondPoint, broadening our fixed income execution offering in the dealer to client segment. While we are still in the early days it\u2019s worth noting that BondPoint is off to a strong start in January registering the best volume month in its history, up 40% year-over-year. Customers are respectively engaging with the platform now that it\u2019s a part of the ICE fixed income ecosystem, demonstrating the complementary nature of our solutions. This suite of products and execution services are delivered over our purpose built secure connectivity safety platform that links the markets information and innovation essential to improving customer workflows. And so we positioned ourselves similar to how we have in times past to help evolve markets at inflection points, to bring efficiencies and to ingrain our services by the virtue of their capabilities into the daily workflows of our customers. Shifting to our role as the leading venue in the world for capital raising, 2017 marked the seventh consecutive year that the New York Stock Exchange led in initial public offerings, raising over $31 billion. This is almost twice the amount raised by any other exchange globally. As the world\u2019s premier listing venue we have attracted 38 of the last 38 large IPOs defined as raising $700 million or more. And in 2017 we raised 89% of the technology sector proceeds in the United States. 2018 is off to an exceptional start with over $8 billion raised through initial public offerings, which is the best January in the NYSE\u2019s 225 year history. I will conclude my remarks on Slide 15. 2017 was another record year. We grew revenues, margins, earnings and capital returns to new levels. We expanded our ability to provide unique mission critical content to drive markets. We enhanced our distribution by bringing markets, information and participants together and we continue to broaden the addressable market for our future strategic growth. So as we look to 2018 and beyond the foundation that we have created for sustainable organic growth has never been stronger nor has our opportunity set then is broad. Just a few weeks into the year we can already report on this strong foundation. In our derivatives business interest rate futures volumes rose 28% in January. Our North American natural gas volumes grew 16%. Our Gasoil volume rose 19%. In our data business global signings were up 12%, while ASV enters the New Year up 6%. And in our newly expanded fixed income business we benefited from BondPoint\u2019s 30% volume growth. And this growth is all off a base record year for us in 2017. As a leading provider of vital infrastructure and information the financial and commodity markets we continue to look for ways to efficiently connect the market participants with the risk management solutions that they need. It\u2019s a virtuous cycle, one fueled by a pursuit of efficiency and productivity. This is the platform that we positioned to generate sustainable long-term growth with benefits accruing to all stakeholders. So I would like to thank our customers for their business in 2017. And I want to thank my colleagues for their hard work and contributions to another record year, a year in which we became the first exchange operator to join the Fortune 500 and were named as one of Fortune magazine\u2019s Future 50 companies. These credits are something that we do not seek out, but I hope that our team takes great pride in being recognized. I will now turn our call back to our moderator Kate and we will conduct the question-and-answer session until 9.30 AM Eastern Time. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Rich Repetto of Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead. Rich Repetto : Good morning Jeff, good morning Scott and I guess I will start broad Jeff, you had a significant win with \u2013 in MiFID II in the open access mandate being delayed. So, I am just trying to get like how important that was to you? And then related to that, when you look at MiFID II, I know you talked about the impact in energy, but MiFID II and Brexit, you have had more time to look at Brexit as well. What\u2019s your view on it now both from a fundamental and M&A standpoint from those two items? Jeff Sprecher : Sure. Well, I think as you know we have spent a tremendous amount of time in Europe with the most senior people in governments all over Europe discussing the pluses and minuses of the open access provision, the way it was drafted and designed in MiFID II. And there is a concern across Europe whether or not the way that that particular provision operates makes sense in the future without the UK as a part of the EU and whether it makes sense to help drive the economy together and finance the real economy without overly fragmenting markets and creating a lot of inefficiencies. So, we saw governments all across Europe coordinate a move to delay that and what you could see now and it gets reported on from time-to-time is a conversation that\u2019s going on across the EU over whether or not that provision fits with their future and whether or not there should be some modification or reworking of broadly of MiFID, but specifically of that provision. So, we are very engaged in that conversation. We had a lot to do with the delay and we appreciate that the governments did delay and that they did engage with us and that they have taken a step back. More broadly, MiFID as I said in my prepared remarks, it was \u2013 it\u2019s just the way markets work, but a lot of people were unprepared and notwithstanding that we all have been talking about MiFID for years now on these calls, but a lot of customers waited till the last minute. There are some very specific reporting requirements. There are some very specific position limits, accountability type requirements. And so I mentioned that the FCA in particular processed over thousand applications. You did see at the end of December and into January a lot of people just stepped out of the market trying to figure out how this would work fortunately its much calmer. The FCA at our request has held a number of meetings and calls, broad calls with the market is going to continue to do more on how MiFID gets implemented across particularly our UK exchange and we really appreciate that they have engaged on that. I have had a lot of Brexit conversations with senior people over this period in addition to talking about MiFID. I think there is a lot of positive work going on underneath the headlines of Brexit, but there still has to be a deal agreed and how that\u2019s going to work and how that\u2019s going to shape out, it\u2019s very hard to know and there is certainly a possibility that things could go pear-shaped in the process. So, we have a cautious view towards Europe right now. That being said, we made an investment in Europe clear, which is a custody custodian \u2013 a custody solution for Europe. It\u2019s one that we use. It\u2019s one that we will continue to use and it\u2019s one that we want to help, grow and expand. So, while we have some broad concerns about how Europe unfolds where we have seen strategic ability to pinpoint opportunity we certainly will do it. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning. I want to talk about the BAML Index business, so you are providing reference data now for BAML, you have got pricing now for BAML I guess maybe you had it before is how do you see? There is analytics for BAML. What kind of cross-selling did you guys pursue in the quarter for these ancillary services? And I know it feels very early, but was there any positive impact from the ancillary services this quarter and if so or even if not maybe what is the outlook against the ancillary services provided to BAML as we look out say like a year or so? Thanks. Jeff Sprecher : Sure. Well, first of all, it\u2019s been great. I mean in a word it\u2019s been incredibly well received. And I have mentioned this before Ken and I think also in response to some of your questions on earlier calls that it gets harder and harder in financial services to provide content to major firms, because of the connectivity and cyber security issues. And because there is so much pressure on firms today from a regulatory standpoint they need really good clean data and information distributed across organizations in a way that is easily consumed. So by having a broader package of things that we can deliver people that didn\u2019t pay attention to these offerings when they weren\u2019t a part of the ICE ecosystem are suddenly paying attention to them and so that is essentially a cross-sell. And because so many people now are hooked to our safety network and increasingly hooking to our safety network in fact is one of fastest growing parts of our company. They have a pipe already that is secure that has the cyber security promenades over it that allows us to pretty easily get behind firewalls and deliver new products and services. So it\u2019s going well. The other \u2013 the interesting thing about this market as we have talked about before on both on this call and you and I privately is that there is kind of rapid demand for clean information and so it is not a case where a customer will buy information from one provider and not buy from a second provider. If people are taking the data and information and indices from multiple providers and some as a backup if you will for their own BCP planning and some just because there is a thirst for the best information that people can find, because of the increased use of quantitative analysis in investing. So longwinded way of saying the thesis that we had is working and Lynn Martin who is running that business is excited frankly about the responses that her team is getting particularly in that area of indices and valuation. Operator : The next question is from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning, Scott you mentioned your capital priorities are returning 100% of the free cash flow net of M&A, so I guess can you update us your thoughts on M&A after pretty active year of divestitures and small deals in 2017? Scott Hill : Yes. I think we are looking at the world the same way, we have said it a while ago that our focus would be on incremental both on deals and that\u2019s absolutely what we have executed on. I think the good news embedded in all of it is we were very active last year and are still sitting right in our leverage range with good on the balance sheet with as I mentioned earlier 20% increase in the dividend and a 20% increase of the share buyback authorization of which we already spent in one-twelfth of the year. So I think as we look out, we are continue to focus on strategic M&A that will enhance businesses that we already have, our strategies that we are pursuing, but the key as is always for us is can we find those deals at the right price that generate the right levels of return for investors. Operator : The next question is from Michael Carrier of Bank of America. Pleased go ahead. Sameer Murukutla : Hi, good morning, guys. This is a Sameer Murukutla on for Michael Carrier. Thanks for taking question. Just a quick one just related to the data services revenue again, I guess one is the 6% to 7% growth including any FX benefits and I guess given the divestitures and the wind down of those businesses and I guess that they are really strong ASVs and signings, I guess why isn\u2019t this growth in \u201818 even higher than the 6% to 7%? Jeff Sprecher : Yes. So first of all, the 6% to 7% as reported or at constant currency in each I expect will be in that range. Obviously, FX right now is a little bit of a help, but I think we will grow between 6% and 7% as reported and at constant currency on an organic basis. And compared to last year that\u2019s coming off 5 and so when you are asking why is not growing faster, it\u2019s growing significantly faster than it did in \u201817. And then I will note a couple of points that \u2013 I will repeat a couple of points that I said in my prepared remarks that includes our pricing analytics business that\u2019s going to grow faster than 7% versus 5% last year and 3.5% in \u201816 and 2% when it was owned by IDC. That includes our connectivity and feeds business that\u2019s going to grow faster than 7% again in 2018. And it\u2019s mitigated a little bit by exchange data where it will grow, but it\u2019s going to grow in kind of the low single-digits. So we are really happy, not only with the overall growth of that business, but the mix of revenues. And then the other thing not to lose sight of is we are growing revenues with a starting margin of 51%, which is significantly above anybody else in our space. So we are happy with the growth, we like the margin profile, the incremental margins will be the better. And again we feel good about the strength of data business across the board. Ben Jackson : And one other point that gets to some of the core of what we do is we have been trying to be more open and transparent about the data that comes out of the cash equities market, the New York Stock Exchange in the cash equities market. We participate in the SIP which is the industry revenue generator. Behind the scenes, we have been pushing the SEP to be more transparent. We have a proposal that\u2019s down the table for quite a while that the SIP committee is looking at and it\u2019s going to take up shortly to become more transparent. We on our last call for the first time started to put more color around that particular business. But long story short, there is really not a lot of growth in the earnings from U.S. cash equities markets. And I think that\u2019s maybe surprised people and is partly why we want there to be more transparency around the SIP. And that\u2019s a part of \u2013 for reporting purposes that\u2019s all embedded in that data business as well. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Blostein : Hi guys, good morning. I want to go back to data again for a second, I am looking at Slide 7, so Scott you guys continued to kind of give us a little bit more color on the drivers in this business which is definitely appreciated, I want to hit on the capacity growth number that you highlighted it\u2019s plus 20% year-over-year on safety network, I guess A, how should we think about this is kind of the leading indicator for data connectivity, any sort of revenue base you can kind of circle around to think about okay this is really the base that is growing and is indicative of this 22% growth or should we think of that more of a pay customers are using more capacity and we will be buying more of our data, so that\u2019s actually a leading indicator for the other stuff? Scott Hill : Yes. That\u2019s a great question. And look we are a couple of years into the business. My sense is that the connectivity capacity growth is very similar to open interest. If it\u2019s trending up \u2013 that if open interest is trending up that\u2019s a good thing about the future prospects of our trading business. As the capacity grows that\u2019s a good thing about our data business. And as we dig deeper into that understanding that business, one of the reasons I have that confidence is connectivity and the feeds businesses growth, so more people are taking more of their data from us. A lot of it\u2019s our proprietary data, but it\u2019s also feeds from other places as we become the single source, they need greater capacity in order to consume the data from us. And including those feeds, we are seeing customers sign up, historically it was more people connecting to the NYSE, now we are seeing more people connect up through safety, which again will help drive more trading, will help drive more data on our \u2013 on the commodities side of our business. So as I look at the capacity growing 20% last year it will grow double digits again in this year, people are moving up smaller ports to larger ports, for me it\u2019s definitely a leading indicator. And one of the reasons why Jeff talked about the additional transparency with regards to exchange data. But one of the reasons why we are giving so much additional transparency on data revenue growth is because we have metrics like this capacity, that give us confidence that the growth we are seeing is sustainable. Operator : The next question is from Ben Herbert of Citi. Please go ahead. Ben Herbert : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just another question around data and just the pricing in analytics, the 40% of signs from your growth [ph] products and then do you think back to your June Investor Day and that mix of data, revenue drivers, I know that\u2019s more of a long-term guide, but if we think of it this year just with newer products how that mix shift, that 20% that was guided back in June that might be a bigger share in \u201818 or maybe even into \u201819 just on some of your newer product developments? Thank you. Jeff Sprecher : Yes, great. So, thanks for the question. So, if you look at our revenue guidance in 2018 what we expect to get from new products is very much in line with what we showed you in June. And so the contribution we expected to be strong, it is strong. In addition to that, some of these new products are also driving another part of that pie we showed you that was meaningful with new customers. And so particularly in Europe, customers who have new demands put on them from MiFID, we are seeing consume those products. And so there is a little bit of a lead over between what\u2019s the new product and what\u2019s the new customer, but each are contributing to the overall growth. And when I talk about the 40% coming from those products, you will understand that some of those are new liquidity indicators. As an example, our BestEx product as an example that continue as evaluative prices has been around for a while, so that\u2019s not really a new product as much as it is for a platform to develop future new products. So overall, the contribution that we showed you in June if you look at it in terms of pricing new products, new customers, high retentions, we have around 95% retention in our pricing analytics business again last year. All of those things are contributing in a very good balance by the way in growth in \u201817 and also again in the growth in \u201818. Operator : The next question is from Alex Kramm of UBS. Please go ahead. Alex Kramm : Hey, good morning. I want to stay on the data side and it\u2019s probably an extension of some of the last few questions, but maybe you can be a little bit more specific around MiFID II and what you are seeing there? I guess, because you are obviously showing the upside in signings in Europe, so maybe you can give a little bit more detail of what exactly you have been seeing, but then more importantly how far along do you think the customer base is when it comes to the data side meaning like do you think throughout 2018 there is still a very big addressable market of people that still need to get ready, you still need to get BestEx products from you. And I guess around the confidence level just for more sales there? Then maybe just real quick on the flipside as well, I mean, budgets are still coming down because of MiFID II. So, I am just wondering if you are actually seeing people also struggling with budgets even canceling some of the things that are not as must have? Thank you. Jeff Sprecher : Yes. So, that\u2019s a great question, Alex and I will tell you I am very bullish on what we are seeing in EMEA related to MiFID II. And I think that \u2013 what I think Lynn Martin and I as we talk about it Tim Noble, who runs sales, they are very excited, but we are early days. There are some companies that have begun to prepare and have begun to understand what MiFID II\u2019s implications are, but its early days. And so as I look at 29% growth in signings in EMEA in terms of pricing and analytics as I look at ASV for pricing and analytics, which is above the 6% ASV on average, there is no question in my mind that MiFID II in particular and we noted on Slide 7 things like BestEx and CEP and liquidity indicators, all of those products are still really in demand in terms of Europe. And I will tell you that some of that confidence in that answer is reflected in the fact that our pricing and analytics signings in January were 40% higher. And so we have seen it and I don\u2019t have the geographic breakdown yet, but my guess is when we split it out, Europe is going to be a big driver of that growth just as it was for the year on Slide 7. The other thing that\u2019s really encouraging is though we have designed these products, the BestEx, the liquidity indicators to meet specific requirements of MiFID II customers in the U.S. and Asia are starting to see the efficacy of using those products as well. And so I am encouraged that those products will continue to be in demand in Europe, but also we will start to contribute more and more to the growth we are seeing in the U.S. and also in Asia. And so it\u2019s a great example where our product innovation to meet a given need with the sales team that\u2019s focused, which ours is, it offers a great opportunity to start to sell those products and their bill for purpose used to the other customers in different geographies and different industries and so excited about Europe, I believe were early days in direct response to your question, but also excited about the prospects for some of those products outside of Europe. Operator : The next question is from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Hi, good morning. Thanks, folks. Maybe just switching gears a little bit to the fixed income strategy, maybe question for both Scott and Jeff on this. Maybe Scott, if you could give us a little bit of a refresh of the revenue contribution from BondPoint parsing that out from NGX, the last data we had is a little old and given the increase in volumes in BondPoint coming into January, I just want to get a better sense of the revenue trajectory in the fixed income trading platform overall? And then maybe just more strategically Jeff, on as you think about that marrying with the BAML indices if you can talk about your view of how that platform will progress during this year? Scott Hill : Yes. So I will start and no, we haven\u2019t disclosed specifically the revenues associated with the bond business. As Jeff alluded to, we had a record month in BondPoint in January over 30% growth in terms of volumes. The way I would characterize it is it\u2019s a relatively small part of our revenue today, but a very big growth opportunity as we move forward. Jeff Sprecher : Yes. And what we have put together is an interesting collection of assets that is all available essentially on that safety network and the way we are thinking about it is that if an existing customer in one of those businesses want to just continue as they have in the past, that\u2019s fine, but what we really are trying to do is go to that customer and say, we have a whole suite of services around fixed income and since we have a purchasing relationship on a connectivity relationship with you, why don\u2019t you think about these other opportunities and we have put those together through our sales efforts in a package if you will. And we also have the benefit of the fact that NYSE Arca is the leading listings platform for ET apps and we have a very close working relationship with the ETF providers and are also following this trend of ETF growth in the fixed income space. It\u2019s a very convenient way for people to own fixed income instruments and is one of the fastest growing parts of that space. So, we \u2013 there are lot of services that\u2019s around NYSE that we can also provide for people that are launching and marketing those kinds of products. So, it\u2019s been a great reception so far with the various bits and bobs that we have put together. And honestly, I think it\u2019s even surprised us that a lot of major companies that didn\u2019t pay attention to certain pieces that we have now that they are under the ICE name and on our connectivity platform, these customers are very engaged with us in a way that bodes well for our future. Ben Jackson : And I will just give you one quick data point in this period, we gave you a chart last quarter that said if you look at BondPoint in Jackson, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch indices does it add about $93 million of revenue and I will tell you that split roughly half between NGX and the other half with BondPoint and Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. So, that will give you an idea of the base from which we believe we will grow. Operator : The next question is from Chris Allen of Rosenblatt. Please go ahead. Chris Allen : Good morning, guys. I am getting this question a lot from clients. So, I was just wondering if you guys could clarify the market data guide what\u2019s the impact from the acquisitions in 2018, it looks about $20 million. Is that based on kind of the 2017 run-rate and does that bake in any incremental growth opportunities for those that set of businesses you acquired? Scott Hill : So, I am going to answer your question and if my answer indicates I didn\u2019t understand, then I ask it again, but our 6% to 7% growth in the data business is an organic number. And so it doesn\u2019t benefit from nor does it detracted from in terms of acquisitions. So again going back to the models we showed you in June that model showed you that typically we will have around 10% plus or minus contribution from acquisitions, but in the 6% to 7% guide, that\u2019s organic \u2013 again organic as reported organic constant currency it doesn\u2019t matter we are going to grow 6% to 7% overall. And if you are looking for kind of the net impact of the acquisitions on data revenues, we gave you that on the last quarter that\u2019s $18 million, but again organic 6% to 7%, no benefit from acquisitions, no work from divestitures, it\u2019s 6% to 7% real growth that we are driving through all the reasons we have talked about on the call. Operator : The next question is from Vincent Hung of Autonomous. Please go ahead. Vincent Hung : Hey. I know you talked about a bit on last quarter\u2019s call and touch upon it today, but now having had a bit of time to look around your cliff and maybe a quarter or so, I will be interested to get your thoughts on that asset in terms of like the structural opportunities or you think you could do for them specifically and then ultimately whether you would be interested in control? Jeff Sprecher : Well, first of all, we think it\u2019s an interesting asset and it\u2019s one that we are a customer of and we use and so it\u2019s important to us. And so we had a \u2013 have had a long pre-existing relationship. But we like the management very much there we like the Chairman. And we really feel like that we can do things with it together with that company to both help us and the ICE shareholders and help Euroclear. It\u2019s similar to all that we had when we invested in Cetip in Brazil, which allowed us to launch a number of new initiatives in Brazil that on the back of that in partnership with Cetip and even though we have now sold out Cetip as it merged into BM&F. We still have those initiatives operating in Brazil and they are still very important to us. So we see that same template if you will with Euroclear. I think that we will know more. We have been invited to join the Board and Hester Serafini, who runs our U.S. clearing operations \u2013 commodity clearing operations is going to join that Board. And so we will have more insight, at least she will have more insight into how we can contribute at the governance level. But long story short I think it\u2019s a very good company and I think we have good relationships that will allow us to find opportunities together. Operator : The next question is from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Chris Harris : Hi guys, you are going to be moving some of your energy contracts to the U.S. I believe later this month, so just wondering can you guys can talk a little bit about that action whether that might create any complexity to your customers and could we see you guys do more there? Jeff Sprecher : Sure, let me ask Ben Jackson who is here for the first time to take that one. Ben Jackson : Thanks Chris. I am going to speak to all of you for the first time in this forum. So it\u2019s easy for people and we got a lot of questions around this when we move to looking at and thinking of this particular fallout from MiFID. And the reality is that this move is primarily about responding to our customers, their trade, our North American energy complex. These customers are primarily based in North America, they wanted our North American products to be based in North America. As Jeff mentioned in his comments our North American energy complex is doing well. When we looked at our portfolio of North American products, some of which were executed in the U.S. maybe our gas power complex in the U.S. and others in Europe with our natural gas liquids and North American oil complex and then you add on top of it the strategic acquisition of NGX. We have even more products in North America. So we collaborate with customers and determined that bringing this complex together in North America was the right way to service their needs. We have always \u2013 it\u2019s important now that we have always had a strategy of having multiple venues around the world to be able to have a diversified portfolio and easy way for our customers that access our various products around the world. Operator : The next question is from Kyle Voigt of KBW. Please go ahead. Kyle Voigt : Hi, I am just going to try one more on Euroclear, maybe one for Scott, I am just wondering if the opportunity came up we are becoming a majority owner in asset that needs a banking license to give you any pause and I believe Euroclear also has a very high credit rating, I think AA for competitive reasons, certain constraints that contain your leverage in credit ratings of the majority owned? And then lastly, maybe you could just give us an update on dividends you expect to receive from Euroclear in 2018 in the other income line? Thank you. Scott Hill : Sure. In the 10 years, I have been here we have never been settled in the M&A. And so the concept of creed to control and all that is \u2013 that\u2019s I guess on further talk, but I think Jeff, it was very eloquently described exactly what our intent here. And I think he is right it\u2019s completely analogous to fatigue. We think the management team now does a good job. We think the Chairman is managing the governance structure in a good way. We know a lot of the customers. We are one of the customers. So this is about aligning our interest interest to try and go after interesting strategic opportunities together, that\u2019s what this is about. And so I have looked at whether I want a banking license or not, we had one of those with ICE Trust. It was a little bit painful, but we managed through it. But again, we are not looking at those considerations, because that\u2019s not what this investment is. This investment is aligning our strategic interest for somebody to whom we are a big customer right now and what we believe can be a good partner and help develop additional custodial and collateral management capabilities that will benefit both of our customer sets. To your specific question, as was reported a week or so ago and as we disclosed further in our 10-K today, we have reached agreement to acquire an additional stake that would bring us to around 9.8% in total. That portion has not yet closed. And so it\u2019s difficult for me to tell you the size of the dividend, it could be 4 to 5. If the dividend is paid before this next set close, it could be 9 to 10, if the next round we get the regulatory approvals we need in time. And then in terms of timing, my expectation would be it would hit in first or second quarter, but we will give you more guidance as we know more on that. Again, the dividend is the nice return that we get over the short-term, but we are in this for the strategic partnership not the dividend. Operator : The next question is a follow-up from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks so much. I just wanted to follow-up on your comments on the market on close offering from BAPS, your view whether that\u2019s going to end up going through despite the protest we got in NASDAQ and maybe just sort of the portion of trading on revenue that happens at the close of the NYSE? Jeff Sprecher : Sure. So, in terms of where that is, it\u2019s been asked for the commission, the full commission to vote on whether or not that market structure should go forward. It\u2019s been approved by the staff and now it will go in front of the full commission. There is no timing on that. It\u2019s not been scheduled. So, it\u2019s hard to know when or if that \u2013 how that will be heard, but we are opposed to the proposal, because the market what we think will happen if that goes ahead is not one competitor challenging the liquidity at the close of the listing exchanges, we think all competitors will challenge all listings and what you will see is a massive fragmentation of the close and on days like Monday, where ETFs and stocks are highly volatile having a difficult time settling to have fragmented that a central moment for benefit that really hasn\u2019t been accounted. I mean, it\u2019s hard to know what the cost benefit of a highly fragmented market will be to save a few pennies and essentially in a market structure. Why one would do that? So, we have asked for the full commission to think about those issues and for the industry to really discuss those issues. Listed companies when they decide where to list their shares have multiple opportunities now to there are 3 about to be 4 exchanges that will handle a listing. And part of the listing process is a discussion about the various auctions and settlement mechanisms that each exchange uses and listed companies are coming out opposed to being forced to have their closing moved to another exchange after they have made a decision and are worried about this fragmentation. So we will see where it goes. I am a bit surprised that this is even being promulgated honestly that the highest priced closing, the person that charges is the most at the closing is the one that\u2019s actually trying to promote this idea. In my mind, I don\u2019t know why they wanted to put that offering that they have at risk, but nonetheless the proposals out there and I think the industry will have a pretty vigorous debate and we will see where this lands, but it won\u2019t be without a lot of negative input from market participants who as they think through the repercussions of the idea. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Sprecher for closing remarks. Jeff Sprecher : Thank you, Kate and we appreciate your time today. Thanks for joining us and we will continue to update you through the quarter and through the year as we build out on the strategy that we discussed. Thank you everybody. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Operator : Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Intercontinental Exchange First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please also note today's event is being recorded. And I'd like to turn the conference call over to Warren Gardiner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead. Warren Gardiner, CFA - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Good morning. ICE's first quarter 2018 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of theICE.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2017 Form 10-K. In our Earnings Supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including adjusted income, operating margin, expenses, EPS, EBITDA and tax rate. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP term in the earnings materials, and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful as well as how management uses these measures in our Form 10-Q. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses, and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the Earnings Supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain terms. Also with us on the call today are : Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Ben Jackson, our President. I'll now turn the call over to Scott. Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Thanks, Warren. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. I'll start on slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our first quarter. 2018 is off to an excellent start. ICE's consolidated first quarter net revenues increased 5% year-over-year to a record $1.2 billion. Data services revenues were $520 million and grew 6% organically. Trading and clearing net revenues increased 11% to $596 million. This solid revenue growth was supported by operating expenses which totaled $494 million for the quarter, slightly below our guidance and down 1% year-over-year. Our revenue growth and expense management generated adjusted operating margins of 60%, up 3 percentage points, and adjusted operating income of $731 million, a 9% increase over last year's first quarter. Looking to the second quarter of 2018, we expect adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $500 million to $510 million, including a full quarter of 2018 compensation changes and the anticipated ramp up of key investment. For the full year, disciplined expense management has mitigated the continued pressure of the weaker dollar even as it benefits our revenues, allowing us to lower the high-end of our expense guidance to $2.040 billion from $2.050 billion. During the first quarter, our bottom line also benefited from another solid quarter at MERS. We have nearly completed our work to deliver the new technology platform that will enable the next phase of our strategy to support automation in the mortgage market. We also received a $15 million annual dividend related to our 10% stake in Euroclear, a nice early return on investment. And in February, a member of our executive committee joined the Euroclear board. Our first quarter adjusted tax rate of 23% benefited from stock vesting in the quarter but was negatively impacted by some unintended consequences of U.S. tax reform related to federal and state taxation of our foreign income. 5% revenue growth, 9% adjusted operating income growth, and a lower adjusted tax rate combined to generate record adjusted earnings per share of $0.90, up 22% from the first quarter of 2017. Additionally, we generated operating cash flow in the first quarter of $573 million. We've used that cash to repurchase nearly $400 million of stock year-to-date through April, and to return $140 million through our first quarter dividend. All that adds up to more than $0.5 billion of capital returned to our shareholders through April, a 28% increase from the same time a year ago. And importantly, adjusted for the benefit of the recent federal tax law change, our ROIC improved by 30 basis points from the fourth quarter and remains well above our cost of capital. Now, please turn to slide 5 where I'll discuss the data and listing segment. Data services revenues were up 6% organically year-over-year. Adjusted margins in the data and listing segment increased by 3 percentage points to 52%. Within data services, pricing and analytics revenues were up 6% organically and signings were up 20%, driven by continued strong performance in our pricing and reference data services. Exchange data grew 3% organically in the quarter. This growth was driven by exchange data related to our futures business which was up 4% year-over-year. Importantly, current growth in our futures exchange data has often proven to be a leading indicator of future growth in trading in our markets. And finally, desktop and connectivity revenue was up 10% organically driven by rising demand for our global connectivity solution reflected in a 14% increase in capacity. Turning to listings, revenue increased 6% organically year-over-year. The NYSE posted its best first quarter for IPOs since 2011, raising over $10 billion in proceeds through 22 offerings despite a number of spikes in the equity market volatility during the period. Let's move next to slide 6. In an effort to provide more transparency and help with the modeling of our data business, we're providing you with incremental detail around our annual subscription value or ASV. ASV provides a point in time snapshot of subscription revenues under contract. And while it does not include revenue from products such as a consolidated tape or future signings, erosion or price increases, at around 90% of our business, it is an important metric to consider as you think about the forward momentum of our data services franchise. At the end of the first quarter, our ASV stood at nearly $1.9 billion and when adjusted for M&A and currency impacts, ASV is up 6.5% year-over-year which is an acceleration from 6% growth entering the year. This supports our continued confidence in our ability to deliver 6% to 7% revenue growth in 2018 and to achieve our long-term target of mid to high-single digits. That confidence is further supported by the 20% growth in pricing and analytics signings and 14% increase in network capacity I previously mentioned. Turning to slide 7, I'll provide an overview of our trading and clearing business. Trading and clearing revenue increased 11% year-over-year in the first quarter. Total ADV increased 4% year-over-year supported by continued strength across our oil franchise including record Gasoil volumes. In addition, we had solid contributions from our Ag, interest rates and equity index offerings including a record sterling and MSCI volumes. Cash equities and options also posted good first quarter volumes, as volatility returned to equity markets. Our CDS clearing business generated record revenues of $42 million in the quarter as a semiannual roll combined with volatility and demand for credit protection led to a record $4.7 trillion in cleared notional. This strong revenue performance helped expand adjusted segment margins to 68% and generated a 12% increase in adjusted operating income compared to the prior year. I'll wrap up on slide 8 with some additional color on our volume trends. In our oil business, building on the momentum of a strong first quarter, average daily volume in April was up 7% year-over-year led by continued strength in Gasoil which was up 36% from the prior year. Gasoil continues to benefit from an expanding diesel market, particularly in Europe and Asia. The benchmark is also increasingly being adopted as a proxy for the refined barrel, providing a liquid and efficient tool for hedging a range of related products. In addition, Brent ADV was up 5% year-over-year in April and open interest once again reached record levels during the period. Year-to-date, Brent volumes are up 3% year-over-year despite realized volatility trending nearly 20% below levels from a year ago. In our natural gas complex, we continue to see commercials gravitate towards our regional markets while realized volatility levels are at historic lows, suppressing the need for commercial hedging, growth across our basis markets has been strong, with futures open interest up 19% year-to-date which helped drive record open interest levels in our North American natural gas markets. Strength across our key financial products has also continued into April. In our rates business, sterling volumes were up 16% year-over-year. After a slower start to the month, volumes accelerated, nearly doubling the pace set through the first half of the month. And while Euribor volume growth has been impacted by significant outperformance in March and April of 2017 related to European political uncertainty, participants continued to position their portfolios for dynamic central bank policy in 2018 and beyond whether related to the ECB, the Bank of England or the Fed, individually or collectively. In addition, our FTSE and MSCI equity index ADV was up 7% for the month as volatility levels continue to be elevated versus the prior year, and customer engagement in non-U.S. equity markets continues to grow. So, to summarize, we delivered a strong quarter and are off and running again in 2018. Mid-single-digit revenue growth alongside strong expense control produced 9% growth in adjusted operating income, early and positive contributions from our recent strategic investment, our capital return priorities, and an improved tax rate further enhanced our earnings growth and yielded a 22% increase in adjusted earnings. And our commitment to executing on our strategic priorities, innovating to serve our customers, and generating positive economic value for our shareholders continues to deliver strong results. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey C. Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Thank you, Scott, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'll begin on slide 9. We've just highlighted a number of secular trends and our strong execution to capture those trends. Our efforts translated into record adjusted operating income, record adjusted earnings per share, and the strength and diversity of our global markets produced record futures volume that resulted in double-digit revenue growth along with solid growth in our cash equity and options markets. Coupled with strong data and listings performance, we expanded margins, generated solid cash flows, and have returned over a $0.5 billion to shareholders through the end of April. While we're pleased with this performance, our focus is 100% on future growth opportunities, which means strategically creating more value for our customers and our shareholders. The breadth and depth of each of our business lines uniquely positions us to lead and to innovate across asset classes and workflows for our customers around the world. We spoke to some of the ways that we're leveraging our global infrastructure at our Investor Day last year. These include our growing index business, our expanding bond platform based on our expertise in supporting markets as they seek automation and technology and our valuable SFTI network. Today this network has evolved well beyond its original capability, as a secure market infrastructure and grown into an expanded platform known as the ICE Global Network which encompasses vast content and connectivity solutions. So turning to slide 10, I'll update you on our growing range of assets and our progress in the index space. The shift towards indexation and passive investing in equities and fixed income has resulted in active managers demanding more data and richer analytics to better understand their benchmarks and to deconstruct market performance as they search for alpha. At the same time, passive managers are seeking more control and flexibility in terms of how they innovate and differentiate their offering. Our customers have shaped our approach to this rapidly-expanding market in a unique way, and they've enabled us to distinguish our services based on their evolving needs. So, while we offer traditional index licensing services and fund managers and ETF sponsors can choose to benchmark to our proprietary indexes under a traditional fee model, we've also become a leader in serving the growing demand for self-indexing services. We're uniquely able to pursue this multi-prong approach, particularly in the fixed income markets because we own the underlying content, as well as the building blocks and the crucial services that go into creating a benchmark. ICE's historical and real-time pricing data, our reference data and our detailed analytics are all key components of index construction. We offer index selection and calculation services. And for ETF sponsors, we operate the leading ETF listing and trading venue in NYSE Arca. So, we've built an open platform where asset managers and ETF sponsors can tailor solutions to meet their specific needs, allowing for customized benchmarks, to enhance and inform risk management or to assist in future product development. We offer complete flexibility, regardless of what managers choose to consume, whether it's an ICE or NYSE-branded index or services around their self-indexing needs. And you are seeing the success of this strategy. Over the past few quarters, we've signed self-indexing agreements with some of the major fund sponsors and we have now established index relationships with 11 of the top 13 ETF sponsors. As a sign of this success, our first quarter index revenue increased 20% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. So, while we're still in the early stages of deploying this strategy, we're executing and we're seeing very encouraging signs of traction within a growing addressable market. I'd like to now move to slide 11. Like a number of the markets that we've helped transform in the past, the fixed income market is held back by many inefficiencies across its trade life cycle and it's a market where buy-side and sell-side are seeking solutions to these issues. Over the past 10 years, dealer inventory levels, which used to be the primary source of fixed income liquidity, declined dramatically. While at the same time the size of the U.S. corporate debt market nearly doubled, the number of fixed income ETFs grew six-fold, and over $1 trillion flowed into fixed income funds in the U.S. alone. And so, with the unwinding of QE policies, market participants are looking for advances in workflow that improve their ability to access information and lower their total cost to transact. We've been aligning our solutions for this transition for some time. Our pricing and reference data is the foundation of our fixed income business, bringing a rich set of content critical to the fixed income trade workflow. Our decades of pricing expertise along with our technology and innovation has combined to lay the groundwork for further product expansion and enhancement, such as with our reference data offering, real-time pricing, indices, liquidity tools and best execution. These products are complemented by an analytics platform that sees nearly $3 trillion of customer assets uploaded each day. This enables us to deliver critical scenario analysis, cash flow modeling and factor-based performance attribution. It provides our customers with a unique window into their inventory and potential trading opportunities. And it's all fueled by our data and can be securely delivered over our ICE Global Network. Our January acquisition of BondPoint brought additional execution technologies and expanded our customer base into underserved markets. BondPoint brought technology such as a click-to-trade protocol that leverages a resting order book, which is similar to our futures and equity markets. Consistent to what we did in the energy markets, this data and liquidity is bringing more efficiency and activity to the fixed income markets, and we'll soon deliver this over the ICE Global Network tapping into a broader community of market participants. In its first quarter, as a part of ICE when coupled to our infrastructure, BondPoint saw average daily notional volumes increase 50% year-over-year, a record for the business. We've also seen a steady growth in liquidity as the average number of bids and offers set a record in the first quarter, up 35% year-over-year. And we've seen rising user participation as we invest and help facilitate more efficiency and growth in this space. And so, as a provider of pre-trade, trade, and post-trade solutions, and as the owner of the underlying content that fuels our tools, we're well-positioned for growth in a growing market. Let me turn to slide 12. The ICE Global Network is a unique offering within the industry. With its roots known as SFTI, its expansion now into the ICE Global Network flexibly serves buy-side and sell-side institutions, data providers, third-party exchanges and clearing houses, traders and market makers. With an unparalleled range of financial market content, including proprietary and third-party data gathered from over 600 unique sources, it serves as a backbone for information flow across global markets. As the markets become more reliant on consuming and analyzing large data sets to manage portfolios, the quality and integrity of data is crucial to wholesale and retail customers. And so, the ICE Global Network distinguishes us as a true provider of end-to-end flexible workflow solutions that connect participants, markets and critical information. Let me conclude my remarks on slide 13. These are just a few of the growth opportunities in front of us. And as you can see, our focus is on differentiated products and services that leverage both our vast infrastructure and our innovative culture. We're driving efficiency and new opportunities for our growing customer base around the world and we've been really deliberate and disciplined in our initiatives to differentiate the value to our customers. We've grown from a small start-up company focused on technology and automation to now a comprehensive provider of risk management solutions across virtually all asset classes around the globe. And with this expansion, the opportunities for our growth have increased, whether it's in data, our commodity and financial markets or how we connect markets to this information. We've never been more focused on driving growth and maximizing the return for all of our stakeholders. Importantly, I'd like to thank our customers for their business and for their trust. And I want to thank my colleagues for their efforts that contributed to yet another record quarter for ICE. I'll now turn the call back to our moderator, Jamie, and he'll conduct a question-and-answer session until 9 :30 Eastern Time. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Rich Repetto from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead with your question. Richard Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Yeah. Good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Scott. Jeffrey C. Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Good morning. Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Good morning. Richard Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : So, I guess the first question is on market data and the 6% organic growth that, right in line with your guidance. I guess, Jeff or Scott, can you talk about is it coming through the buckets that you put out, the different areas of growth that you sort of guided to in the Analyst Day which was 30% I think, pricing and new customers and new products and stuff, but is it coming from those products \u2013 those buckets? And then also, if you look at some of your peers, one peer saw actually a pullback in market data, another saw strong organic growth. I'm just trying to see I would imagine your market data is much more differentiated because of the fixed income and the broader foundation you have. But if you could differentiate, I guess, from your other exchange peers and their data offerings? Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yeah. Okay. Thanks, Rich. So, first of all, yes, broadly, the revenue growth is coming in the buckets that we indicated. As I said at the Investor Day last summer, it's not every year going to be exactly 30% from pricing and 20% from new products, et cetera, but it's generally coming from those buckets. And you get a number of indicators that can demonstrate that. For example, I mentioned pricing and analytics signings was up 20%. That's all about the 60% of the buckets that are new products, and new customers, and selling our existing customers more. So, as we're working to give you guys more metrics, we're trying to give you ones that will indicate where that growth is coming from. And again, signings is a good example. Connectivity is another one where capacity is up 14%. Again, that may be the same customer demanding more capacity or new customers driving capacity. So, we're seeing good contribution from all of those new products, new customers, et cetera. And of course, we are getting some contribution from price as well. And I think all of that leads to not only a good quarter where we delivered the 6% organically, but it builds into an ASV that I mentioned is up organically in constant currency 6.5%. So, I think that's fundamentally what's driving it. I think you're right there seemed to be some issues with some of our peers with regards to their data both sequentially and year-to-year. We actually had a good quarter in exchange data. As I mentioned on the call, we had a really strong futures exchange data growth of 4%. I think one of the things you're seeing in our results, it's certainly what you mentioned, which is the diversity of products that we have to offer. So, we're not subject to any single market. It's not just about natural gas. It's not just about oil. It's not just about the U.S. or Asia. It's not just about interest rates, we've got a breadth of products. But I really think a key difference for us today versus maybe a year or two ago is the nature of our sales team. With the acquisition of IDC, we acquired a really strong sales team, a really good sales leader. And Tim Noble, who you met at our Investor Day, and Chris Edmonds, who runs our Global Commodity Sales, have really worked hard together on cross-selling. So that when we're out talking to customers about IDC's information (00:24:11) or ICE data services information, to the extent there's an opportunity for energy data or interest rate data, we're able to communicate among the sales teams and go execute on that. So it's breadth of data. It's strength of sales team. And then the last thing I would say that distinguishes us is we serve a commercial market. And I mentioned the fact that our basis market open interest is up 19% in natural gas. That's because more people are fracking and more people are working on the shale and those types of initiatives. And those commercials are surrounding our market and in order to hedge their risk they need our data. So, I think it's all of that combined that's allowed our overall data business to perform well and underneath that specifically for our futures and exchange data to grow. Richard Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Got it. And I'll try to make the follow-up quick, it probably won't be. But on the fixed income market, Jeff, you've talked about \u2013 and thanks for the info in what you've done with BondPoint and sort of your platform behind it. I guess, how do you look at the \u2013 overall, you've talked about how distribution is so important. How do you look at it from like an organic or inorganic \u2013 if other platforms that had distribution came available, I would \u2013 just how would you evaluate? I would imagine it would be a good fit with what you're doing, or do you think you're \u2013 you've got the platform and the trading platform combined where you don't have to look at acquisitions? Jeffrey C. Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yeah. I've got a couple thoughts. First is, we're trying to \u2013 the bond market is so big, so global and so analog that there's a lot of touch points for its conversion to digital. One is trading. But as I tried to point out in my prepared remarks, we want to touch the workflow as many places as we can and starting with that data set and the connectivity we have on the ICE Global Network, just helping people with workflow. If we can enhance trading, that would be great, but that's not necessarily our driver. Our driver is where can we touch your workflow, indexation, data, analytics, analysis on the market as a whole, and that's how we're thinking about it. In terms of M&A, I mean, we have kind of a playbook here that you've witnessed for years. We like to buy very small immature companies that we think, are poised for growth where, when we bolt them onto the infrastructure that we have, we can accelerate their growth. That allows us to pay a premium for those companies knowing that just putting it into our network can accelerate that and deliver value for our shareholders even though we may have to pay a premium to buy the business. And then, on the other extreme, we buy legacy businesses that have fallen out of favor, that have sort of lost energy. And we go in and slice and dice them and sell off parts, and reconstruct them, and try to reenergize them again and that's worked very well for us. And so, that broadly speaking we sort of look at the two end points of a company's life cycle, and we do well on both of those ends. It's less obvious to us that buying something in the middle, in other words, that's growing and fully priced, that we can make a difference. So, that's why BondPoint was a very good fit for us. And the fact that it's growing at 50% validated our hope. Similarly buying IDC, which was a very mature company that was growing at 3%, then turning it around now so that we doubled that growth rate validated that point for us. Richard Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Got it. Thank you very much. Very helpful, Jeff. Jeffrey C. Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. And I'm going to follow up on that question. So, in terms of fixed income, you've talked about the suite of products, like indexes to ETF listings, to data, to analytics. As the market migrates from voice to electronic trading in fixed income, how does the value proposition in data evolve for ICE and IDC, like where does the value proposition go from and where does the value proposition go to? And to connect this to Tradeweb, should that company fall into a competitor's hands, to what extent does that create a threat for ICE's fixed income data business in the long term? Thanks. Jeffrey C. Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Sure. So, if you think about the move from analog to digital in any market, one of the things that will \u2013 or a couple things that will happen will be one, you'll broaden participation because it will be easier to access the market, and you'll likely increase the velocity because there will be an immediacy of your ability to trade in and out of a position. And as you know, there are so many bonds in the world that it's very unlikely that the market will move to a true bid, offer futures-type platform because there are just too many names. And then in each name, you have different tenors. And so, what we think and what we're seeing, and we're all witnessing, is that the more liquid names, the more well-known names, the tenors that are earlier duration if you will and more in favor, tend to be liquid and can trade on a platform. But then you have all this other inventory around the world that just isn't likely to be able to trade on a two-way bid, offer. It's not going to have price transparency. And so, you're going to need daily marks for those names. And we view that we're going to be the provider of those marks. And as the market broadens, as there are more participants and more interest in the market, as there has been by just some of the data that I read in my prepared remarks, we think there are going to be more customers that want to demand that data. So, Tradeweb is in the world right now, to answer your specific question. It's owned by a group of people. If it's owned by a different group of people, I'm not sure it changes anything for us. More importantly, we keep investing in the technology to calculate and deliver more and more accurate off-the-run and difficult names that the market is demanding because they've made their ways into portfolios. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Maybe (00:31:27) a wonky question, but China has launched an oil contract that's gained traction as I think we all expected. And I think in the near term it would seem to be a positive, it creates another arbitrage opportunity, I think as you have discussed in the past. So, longer term, what does this mean for Brent in the context of a market with potentially two viable oil contracts rather than one? I'm not sure it makes a difference, but that's part of it. And it ultimately begs the question, is there a way for ICE to leverage or better leverage the China opportunity directly or indirectly? You've got a suite of commodity and financial products. Can you do better with China? It seems like a big opportunity. Thanks. Jeffrey C. Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yeah. So, first of all, what's interesting about the China contract that you referenced is that it's a delivery contract. In other words, it's a contract that's priced at the delivery point. That's not the way the benchmarks have worked in oil historically. Brent oil and WTI oil are priced at their source, their production source. And so, the market has sort of grown up with take the benchmark at its production source and then add a basis price to it, which essentially is a transportation and infrastructure price to get the product to its delivery point. So, we obviously trade Brent, and we also have listed a Brent-Dubai basis market and that market is a very active market. We have a competitor that has also a \u2013 or a peer at least that has an exchange in Dubai. And so, in any event, there is this sort of notion of, okay, here's what the value of oil is in Dubai. That's largely \u2013 now add a transportation and infrastructure component to that price and now you've got the price of oil in China. And so what we see is, as I think you alluded to is that, that China contract is additive to the market. It's one more basis point in a world that is full of basis points. We list over a thousand energy contracts. Most of those are different grades and different delivery points than the benchmark of Brent and WTI. So we think it will be additive. We think it probably will contribute to growth in the benchmark contracts for not just in the short run, but into perpetuity. The second part of your question was we have a lot of Asian oil and petrochemical and commercial customers that come and do business with us in Europe. They've set up trading desks there. They have infrastructure in Europe. And so similarly to the oil, they've come to the source, if you will, of where the trading is. And so we don't expect that to change because those outposts for those Asian companies that are in Europe are being used to hedge all kinds of business and attract talent that would be difficult to attract on to the mainland. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Jeff, I want to go back to the indexation trend that you've highlighted and totally hear you on the self-indexation, definitely seems like a pretty big opportunity. Can you guys help us think about kind of the yield that ICE could get on a dollar in fixed income AUM that's going self-index, because it definitely feels like that's the market that's going to grow considerably. And then just maybe a reminder in terms of kind of the royalties you guys are getting on the proprietary indices as well. Jeffrey C. Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Sure. Well, our thought process is that the asset management space is getting more and more and more competitive. And the historical model of \u2013 and in doing so, it's getting increasingly concentrated into the hands of larger managers. And those managers are building their own brands. And in the past, a lot of the brands were the brand names that were on the indices. We have a lot of NYSE-branded indices. I mean, that's an amazing brand. And we were able to charge dollars per AUM in order for people to reference those brands. But as the managers themselves form their own brands, what they're finding and what many of them are finding is they can create their own \u2013 put their own name on their own index, and it has a lot of power in the market, and they can do that at a price much cheaper because they don't have to pay for the third party's brand. So, what we've done is, as I mentioned, try to create an open platform where we will sell you services on a non-dollar per AUM basis. We have, for example, calculation engines that we can license you under a more traditional software license. We have our own strong brands that we can license you on a dollar per AUM basis. And then, where we've really been working is in the middle, which is let's have some value between the two of us where we recognize the strong brand of the manager, but we also recognize that the data and analytics and index selection and calculation, third-party validation that ICE does also has brand value. And so, let's come up with some lower dollar per AUM or some hybrid model. We have been very open with you, Alex, and also with our customers that we think we can grow this data market at high to mid-single digits. We think it's going to grow like that for quite a while because of the trends that are in the market. And when we sit across the table and negotiate we basically say to people this is the kind of return that we're looking for if you want to do business with us and we recognize you are going to use your brand to go gather dollars in the form of AUM, and we hope that you can gather them at mid to single \u2013 high-single digits as well, and in which case there's a deal to be made. And so, that's our strategy. We're not getting greedy. We're trying to work with the managers and it's really been successful. We've really done a very good job, getting 11 out of the 13 top managers onto this platform. And as Scott said, it's helped to drive future contract growth and accelerating our data offering. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's helpful. And then, just a cleanup question for Scott. The slightly lower expense guide for the year, obviously despite FX, is that the additional synergies or just the timing of some of the synergies being pulled forward? Kind of what was the delta versus the prior? Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: No, it's a good question. We're right on track with regard to the synergies, the $30 million target that we had for this year. Ben, sitting to my left, he and the team are working and will certainly deliver that. We're actually generating some efficiencies in other parts of our business. The two more recent acquisitions, we believe we'll be able to integrate more efficiently than we had originally anticipated. I'll circle you back to where we were coming into the end of the year, one line item I mentioned was that we would have the net of all the M&A and integrated businesses, and FX as about a $15 million expense hurt but covered by over $40 million of revenue and that number has actually come down now. The expense impact is probably going to be only around $10 million, but the revenue is going to be better than $60 million. And again, that's from better integration of the more recently acquired businesses, plus continued efforts at efficiency in our core business. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys. Let me just get back on data, I guess. For the 6% to 7% growth and obviously also the longer-term mid- to high-single digits, can you talk about growth in Europe and your view on that? It looks like \u2013 correct me if I'm wrong, but it looks like the mix of the revenue shifted actually towards the U.S. from Europe quarter-over-quarter. So, I guess, maybe what drove that, if that's correct? And then how are you looking at the MiFID environment and the growth in data customers from Europe versus the rest of your mix? And also, Jeff, you talked about active \u2013 increased data usage from active managers in relation to indices, maybe you could just elaborate on that, what they're actually doing? Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Sure. Yes. So, look, I think, with regard to the first quarter and frankly for the year, the European revenues continue to do well and continue to contribute strongly, driven, as you said, by the MiFID II which, as we've indicated previously, even though it's now in place, there are a number of customers still scrambling to come into compliance. And so I think that's not unique to the first quarter. I think it's frankly not even going to be unique to this year. I think it will continue on into 2019 as well. And I think the place you see that even more clearly is if you look at signings. Signings in Europe were up 81% year-over-year. Now, I'm not forecasting that we're going to grow 81% every single quarter, but it is another indication that the sales team and the number of products they have to sell to help customers with MiFID II is really delivering. And so, as the European business will continue to contribute strongly, Asia Pacific continues to emerge and the U.S. just continues to put up solid numbers. Jeffrey C. Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: And on the second point, you may recall last year, we bought the bond evaluation business from S&P. It's is a very good transaction for us and that we were able to combine their evaluations business with our evaluations business and create a stronger offering, and then turn around and give S&P back the results which helped in their ratings, improving their ratings capabilities given that they have better underlying data. But that same capability, which is just having better and stronger ability to value fixed income products has particularly gotten the interest of the major asset managers. There's been a lot of growth obviously in ETFs over the last few years, particularly in the equity space. And you're seeing that same trend now move over to putting fixed income and other kinds of assets into the ETF design and they're having really good success. It's a real growth area. And so, in the bond area, we acquired the Bank of America Merrill Lynch bond index portfolio, thousands of indices. So, we have a standard, well-known, well-respected licensing platform that we can use. But we also have all this underlying data, and the ability, and the expertise with a lot of quantitative people that can actually help a manager design an index and figure out how to have an index that will not only be attractive but will be operable in terms of being able to do substitutions and provide end-of-day valuations. And so, that business has done particularly well and, as I mentioned, is attracting a lot of the top managers who are focusing on the non-equity ETF space right now. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just a question on RPC in energy. Obviously, that's improved nicely into the end of the year, and then it looks like it took a dive in the first quarter but now is back up in April again. So, maybe if you can just talk about what were the drivers? It looks like it's not really mix shift, so I don't know if there's anything else going on underneath there? Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yeah. Look. I think as you go through some of the more volatile period that you saw in the first quarter that tends to have a bit of downward pressure on the RPC. But again, whether you look at first quarter or April or last year or any given quarter, we're relatively consistent. For energy, I think we're $1.37 in April. You go back and look over time, we've been somewhere between $1.33 and $1.42. So plus or minus a couple cents each year. And I think that's one of the reasons why despite one of our peers where you see the RPC drop off as volumes grow, we are able to maintain volume growth, maintain open interest growth and, most importantly, because it's where the bottom line is made, we're able to maintain our revenue share, which we have consistently done regardless of volumes, and that's through the management of RPC. You're right. I don't think there's a particularly large mix impact in April, although we certainly benefited from Brent being strong and nat gas volumes were down, and that's lower RPC. But I think, generally speaking, it's just us paying attention to the rates. It's us being a more commercial market and not needing to pay for trade flow. And those are the things that have allowed us to be stable. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. So, is RPC more in line with sort of the most recent trend rather than sort of the sub \u2013 lower first quarter for the rest of the year aside from mix? Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: I'm not sure I heard your question well. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: No. Just in thinking about RPC trend in energy, would we look at April as a better \u2013 April and the fourth quarter of last year as sort of a better guide for the rest of 2018...? Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yeah. Look, again, plus or minus a couple of pennies in any month or any quarter based on volatility, market participation and products, it could move around. But, yeah, I think again, you look over the last 8, 10, 12 quarters, we're around that $1.37 plus or minus a little bit almost every month and every quarter. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thank you. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt from KBW. Please go ahead with your question. Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Jeffrey C. Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Good morning. Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Just on the strong other income of $19 million in the quarter, I think you called out $15 million that was a Euroclear dividend. I'm guessing the remaining $4 million or $5 million was MERS and the dividend from OCC. And you called out MERS in your prepared remarks as you're rolling out this new digital infrastructure and investing that business this year. Just wondering if you'd give us some more color on the progress for that business and whether or not we could see more substantial growth in that equity income line from MERS specifically or maybe some step function type growth as the new platform is fully rolled out. Thank you. Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yeah. Let me start quickly with the wonky and (00:46:43) then I'll hand it to Jeff to talk about the MERS strategy that we're excited about. So, in other income, you're right, we had the $15 million dividend. In that line there are always a bunch of stuff moving around. But just for the rest of the year, there are three things that matter; OCC dividend, the MERS contribution that we take, and the impact of pension expense which moved down into other income this year. And so, as you kind of think about the out quarter, $6 million to $8 million in other income is going to be about the right range. That's $8 million to $10 million from OCC and MERS and a negative $2 million from pension. So, obviously, we gave you that from a model standpoint. We definitely got a good contribution from MERS in the first quarter, and I'll let Jeff talk to you about where we're headed with that. Jeffrey C. Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Sure. So the progress we've made is that we've built essentially an all-new infrastructure for MERS. That infrastructure is running in parallel with the legacy system. And we are now in the process of opening up the new system, if you will, for market participants. There are hundreds of people in the mortgage space that have digital platforms that need to hook to MERS. So it will take some time for the market to spill over into the new platform. But we are deeply engaged with the market participants, particularly major market participants. And we would expect that they, over the summer and into the third quarter, will start to rebuild their systems and connect to the new MERS. That's an \u2013 the reason I get into that level of detail, that's an important point because once that infrastructure is all in place, people who are dealing in mortgages will now have a much more robust platform that they can start to change their own workflows and move much more towards a digital mortgage. Some of the early adopters in the space have been engaged with us for quite some time, trying to figure out how they can improve their own internal workflows and engage with MERS. It will be \u2013 it's hard for us to gauge specifically how quickly they'll be able to adopt digital mortgages, but it's definitely coming. It's definitely a trend \u2013 a macro trend that that has the engagement of the industry because, right now, in the U.S., it's a very, very clumsy market. At the end of the day, mortgages get registered usually locally with some kind of registrar. There are thousands and thousands of jurisdictions that deal with mortgages at the local level. So, it will take a lot of time for local jurisdictions to start to think about digital records and not boxes of paper. But the goal is to try to digitize as much of the workflow, the upstream, the actual homeowner participation, sit in your kitchen, be able to read your mortgage on a screen, be able to click with your signature, and keep all of that underwriting process as digital as possible until we get to the last recordation, in which case it may have to become paper and handed to a registrar. But that's the vision if you will. And we're well on track to deliver our part of it. So, we expect growth, and we've been pleasantly surprised that there's been early adopters that have helped, driven strong results for us. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Carrier from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks, guys. Jeff, maybe first one, just we saw a big kind of improvement in the CDS or the credit business this quarter. And it seems like cyclically we should see maybe more of that. But just wanted to get your guys' sense on is there enough clarity on sort of the regulatory backdrop and how that market's working now versus maybe the past couple of years where we could see more traction just given kind of the changing dynamics in the market? Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yeah. It's a good question. That business has been on a steady march up since we opened it, and it continued in the first quarter this year. And I think the thing that's probably been the most encouraging over the last four to five quarters, maybe even a little longer than that is that need for a regulatory push into clearing doesn't exist anymore. Customers are coming because they see the efficacy of clearing. And so, when you see a big quarter like the first quarter, where you've got a lot of people looking to cover their credit exposure, you see big notional come into clearing. And the reason it drives the revenues the way it did is because it's not those nine guys that helped us start the clearinghouse back in 2008. It is the buy-side firms. It is the other smaller financial institutions that want that protection, that want to see it cleared in order to have the confidence in their risk management. So, I'm very pleased with how that business has trended. Clearly, it helped that the first quarter was a roll month. So, I don't expect it repeats in the second quarter, but in the third quarter, around another roll, I suspect it will be really solid again. This year, I think we'll continue the trend of that business growing 10% plus or minus a little bit. So, the market dynamics are very good. Customers have seen the efficacy of the clearing model, and the regulatory push isn't really needed anymore for us to grow that business. Operator : Our next question comes from Vincent Hung from Autonomous. Please go ahead with your question. Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP : Hi. So, what do you think is your key challenge in claiming more market share of fixed income ETF AUM? And I'd be particularly interested in your thoughts on competition around what you're seeing from the large players like Bloomberg in market (00:52:44) because I recall one of the benefits of Bloomberg's acquisition of the Barclays business for you was the customer preferred the index calculated by IDC data and so then they shifted for the ICE Treasury bond index? Jeffrey C. Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yes. So, we have, as you pointed out, Vincent, we have competitors in that space, but we're all a little bit unique. And honestly, many of the major managers want to see everybody's information. There's this thirst for information right now that people are consuming as much of it as they can get. So, I'm not sure a lot of our customers necessarily are thinking of us as competitors. They're just thinking of us as a bunch of complementary data providers that can give them the ultimate vision, if you will. But we've done a really good job of establishing our own brand, if you will. IDC was well known, as you mentioned. The Bank of America Merrill Lynch indices were well known. And putting that together under the ICE banner and getting it onto our network has strengthened both of them, and we are a highly viable competitor. We also have very close relationships with a lot of the large managers. We touch them in many, many ways including on ETFs, as you mentioned, in our listings venue. So, we know the people there, we are deeply engaged at many levels of these organizations so that we can talk about their challenges and our opportunities, and that seems to be helping. If you add that index business that you're talking about to the fact that we are working on a complete workflow solution, to plug into these companies and help them at the multiple touch points that they need in the front, middle and back office, help them with regulatory compliance, with MiFID issues and what have you. All of that organically is helping to drive our indices into these organizations and is contributing to that nice, steady, we think, long-term growth that we're going to continue to get from that business. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Herbert from Citi. Please go ahead with your question. Ben Herbert - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to go to the capital return and just how you're maybe thinking about the buyback discussions with the board, just given it was authorized pre tax reform? And then maybe against that, just your capacity on M&A? Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yeah. So, let's start with the buyback. So, we consistently, obviously, talk with our board about our strategy. And as we go in with them, we're typically talking about best use of capital. And one of the things we do with that is we look at kind of where do the analysts think our price should be, how are we priced relative to the market, and then we've got our own internal model of where we're priced. And right now, frankly, it's a pretty easy discussion with the board that says yeah, go spend every dollar you generate that you don't need for internal investment in M&A on buyback because that's the best return on investment. And you're seeing it. I mean, $400 million, we told you we did $100 million in January. We told you we did $400 million through April. So, you can kind of see the trend. If you run rate that out and add the dividend on top of it, you'll know that it's going to be the most significant capital that we have returned largely in buybacks because that's where we think it makes the most sense. Having said that, the important second question you asked is capacity for M&A. And the good news is we're where we need to be from a leverage standpoint. We're generating really solid cash flows, and we've been able to execute some strategic transactions without dialing back on the buybacks. We did the BondPoint deal and we still bought back shares. We made the investment in Euroclear and we still bought back shares. And so, with the cash generative ability of our company right now, we're not having to pick either or. There will certainly come a time with the right deal at the right moment where we can generate the right return, where we may have to make tradeoffs, but that's not where we are right now. And it's certainly not where we are in terms of allowing us to return over $0.5 billion through April. Operator : And our next question comes from Chris Harris from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question. Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. I wanted to ask you guys a follow-up question on the Shanghai Brent contract. You guys rightly point out that the introduction of this definitely creates a new opportunity for traders to go back and forth between your market and China. But how should we be thinking about your commercial customers that are based in Asia? Might this contract lead some of those customers to maybe switch over to the Asian-based contracts or not? Just how should we be thinking about that? Jeffrey C. Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Sure. Well, I mean, if you're an Asian customer that wants delivery of oil in Asia, you have an opportunity to buy that contract. But if you're the producer of the oil, you're probably in the Middle East or in the North Sea or in the United States and you've got to figure out how to hedge that, not only the production but then the transportation and infrastructure to get it into China. And so, remember there's two sides of every trade and what we're seeing is commercial customers that want to service China coming in to these traditional benchmarks and basis contracts and increasing volume. So, I don't expect that this displaces anything. It's kind of a new basis contract of which we have hundreds in the market right now. It's an important one because it represents China, a growing economy. But there are lots of important basis markets in the world and the underlying benchmarks which we happen to trade both of the big oil benchmarks, we'll continue to do well against growth in those basis markets. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, at this time, and reaching the end of the allotted time for today's question-and-answer session, I'd like to turn the conference call back over to management for any closing remarks. Jeffrey C. Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Well, thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you in August and that's when we'll report results for the current quarter. Have a good morning. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Intercontinental Exchange Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please also note that today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Warren Gardiner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Warren Gardiner - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Good morning. ICE's second quarter 2018 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of theice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2017 Form 10-K. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including adjusted income, operating margin, expenses, EPS, EBITDA, organic revenue, free cash flow and tax rate. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP term in the earnings materials, an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful as well as how management uses these measures in our Form 10-Q. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses, and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain terms. Also with us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Ben Jackson, our President. I'll now turn the call over to Scott. Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Thanks, Warren. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. I'll start on slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our second quarter. ICE's consolidated second quarter net revenues increased 6% year-over-year to a record $1.25 billion. Data & Listings revenues were $637 million while Trading & Clearing net revenues were a record $609 million. Adjusted operating expenses totaled $503 million for the quarter, slightly below the midpoint of our guidance range and up modestly versus the second quarter of last year. Adjusted operating margins expanded two points to 60% and adjusted operating income rose 8% to $743 million. These strong operating results, coupled with a lower adjusted tax rate of 24%, generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.90, up 18% from the second quarter of 2017. And importantly, through the first half of 2018, operating cash flows increased 13% to $1.2 billion. We've returned nearly 85% of that cash through nearly $760 million of share repurchases and $280 million in dividend payments. You'll note that we accelerated roughly $160 million of repurchases into the second quarter following the short-term decline in our share price after our last earnings call. We continue to expect to fully utilize the approximately $440 million remaining on our original $1.2 billion share authorization during the second half of the year. Now let's move to slide 5 where I'll discuss the Data & Listings segment. Data services revenues were up 4% year-over-year on an organic constant currency basis. Adjusting for the impact of the audit true-up we noted during last year's second quarter and some delayed implementations in our connectivity business during this year's second quarter, 2Q growth would have accelerated to above 5%. This solid revenue growth combined with synergy achievements helped improve adjusted operating margins in our Data & Listings segment to 52%. Within data services, pricing and analytics revenues were up 7% on an organic constant currency basis in the second quarter. That's an acceleration from 5% in the first quarter. And with further acceleration expected in the second half, we remain confident that this business will grow 7% for the full year. That's two times to three time faster than prior to our acquisition of IDC. Importantly, that strong organic growth doesn't yet include the benefits of the Bank of America Merrill Lynch indices where revenues were also up meaningfully from where they were a year ago driven by leveraging ICE's global sales force. Moving to exchange data, revenues were flat year-over-year on an organic constant currency basis. Revenue derived from the Consolidated Tape plan was down year-over-year somewhat offset by modest growth in the NYSE prop data. In our futures business, data revenues were down 3%. However, adjusted for the 2Q 2017 audit fee, our futures data grew 4% on an organic constant currency basis. Finally, desktop and connectivity revenue was up 2% on an organic constant currency basis. Connectivity and feeds grew 4% despite the impact from the previously mentioned connectivity implementation delays. We expect connectivity and feeds growth to reaccelerate in the third and fourth quarter, and we continue to expect full year revenue growth of 7%. Our desktop revenues, which represents less than 4% of our overall data revenues, declined 8% on an organic constant currency basis. The market trend away from standardized desktop terminals to customizable feed and alert-driven solutions continues. In addition, we are seeing erosion in our retail platform eSignal where there is typically higher customer churn and competitive offerings with a wider range of services attached to the platform. Looking to the second half, organic ASV in the third quarter is up 6.3% including pricing and analytics ASV up over 7%, and connectivity and feeds up over 7%. We expect continued sequential improvement in revenues and revenue growth in the third and fourth quarters. Assuming current spot rates hold, we anticipate third quarter data revenues between $530 million and $532 million and fourth quarter revenues between $538 million and $542 million. Turning to listings, revenue increased 5% organically year-over-year. The NYSE raised nearly $9 billion through 20 IPOs in the second quarter. Through the first half of the year, the NYSE remained the global leader in capital raised through IPOs with over $19 billion. We are now home to 21 of the last 22 IPOs that have raised over $1 billion. Please turn to slide 6 where I'll provide an overview of our Trading & Clearing business. Trading & Clearing revenue increased 11% year-over-year in the second quarter. In our futures business, revenues grew 10% versus the prior year despite only a 1% increase in volumes. A positive mix shift towards higher RPC products such as gasoil, ags, and emissions yielded a 9% year-over-year improvement in our blended futures RPC. While July volumes have been lower, open interest in our oil franchise is tracking up 11% led by double-digit growth in our benchmark Brent contract. On the agricultural side, open interest is up 17% year-over-year. And in our rates business, open interest is up 11% led by Euribor and Gilt which are up 32% and 25%, respectively. As we've said before and as we saw during the first half, elevated levels of open interest generate strong trading volumes when mixed with volatility. Our over the counter markets benefited from strength in CDS clearing as well as ICE BondPoint. During the second quarter, demand for credit protection and continued strong buy side clearing activity drove a 45% year-over-year increase in CDS notional cleared. Volume at BondPoint grew nearly 20% versus last year on a pro forma basis. The strong revenue performance combined with disciplined expense management enabled expanded adjusted operating margins of a 68% and generated a 12% increase in adjusted operating income compared to the prior year. I'll conclude my remarks on slide 7. We're pleased with the strong start to 2018. First half revenues increased 5%. Adjusted operating profit increased 8%. Cash flows increased 13%. And adjusted EPS grew 21%. Our Trading & Clearing segment generated 11% revenue growth, margins expanded to 68% and open interest in July is up double digits in our oil, ags and rates products. During the first half, on an organic constant currency basis, our pricing and analytics business grew 6% and our connectivity and feeds business grew 7% while the NYSE remained the leader in IPO proceeds raised. We remain on track to achieve our 2018 synergies and our Data & Listings margins expanded to 52%. And we returned more cash to shareholders during the first six months of 2018 than we have in a full year prior to 2017 even as we continue to invest opportunistically in strategic assets that will further enhance our future growth profile. The right-hand side of slide 7 reflects updated guidance. Though our full year organic constant currency data revenue growth will be between 5% and 6%, our second half guidance reflects continued sequential improvement and overall growth in our data revenues of at least 6% on an organic constant currency basis. That accelerated growth will be supported by continued strength in pricing and analytics, and connectivity and feeds which, as mentioned previously, we continue to expect to grow at or above 7% for the year. Our core second half expense will land us near the low end of our original guidance entering 2018 and our adjusted tax rate for 3Q and 4Q is expected to remain around 24%. $23 million to $25 million in TMC and CHX expenses along with $10 million of nonrecurring severance charges related to our recent deals will be offset by incremental revenues of $33 million to $35 million. Our interest expense will be around $67 million in the third quarter and $73 million in the fourth reflecting our use of debt to fund important strategic initiatives while still returning a record $1.7 billion to shareholders in 2018. We began 2018 confidently. And having now met our first half objectives and established the foundation for a number of strategic growth initiatives that Ben and Jeff will discuss, we are even confident entering the second half of the year and looking towards 2019. With that, I'll hand the call to Ben. Benjamin R. Jackson - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Thanks, Scott, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'll begin on slide 8. When we acquired Interactive Data nearly three years ago, it brought a core foundation of fixed income pricing and analytics, the gold standard for price evaluations and pre and post trade analytics spanning nearly three million instruments around the world. We then bolted on additional content that is complementary to that foundation such as the S&P Securities Evaluation business and the Bank of America Merrill Lynch indices. With these assets now fully integrated, we bring to market a comprehensive solution of new and innovative services such as helping our customers better understand the quality of their execution and the liquidity risks associated with their positions. We have also engaged with that community of fixed income traders and asset managers about their workflow challenges. And the resounding issue is with trade execution. Whether it is a cash trade or in a mutual fund, an insurance company looking to hedge risk or a market participant that wants to create or redeem a share of the fixed income ETF, all of these participants are dealing with very manual and archaic processes and are looking for different and more efficient ways to source liquidity. As many of you know, fixed income today is still largely a voice market but it is also one seeking greater automation. We expect this evolution will continue as it has in many asset classes going from voice to RFQ to a central order book over time. And it is why BondPoint and TMC are such exciting assets. Specifically by marrying click-to-trade technology, which is essentially a central order book streaming thousands of CUSIPs throughout the day with critical pre and post trade data and analytics, we have a recipe to facilitate greater efficiency, efficiency that is very much in demand as both banks and asset managers search for greater productivity across their businesses. The phone is no longer an option for the high volume, smaller trade size, a result of fixed income market structure changes that have fragmented inventory. And thus, the efficiency in executions that our platforms provide is being embraced by the buy side, the sell side, corporations, and wealth advisors. BondPoint and TMC are also very complementary. First, BondPoint is largely a corporate venue while TMC leads in munis. Each began by catering to wealth managers, market makers, and the buy side. And over time, this audience has expanded to include sell side and corporates. And by leveraging our connectivity to the broader trading community, we expect to further expand this customer base. Since acquiring BondPoint and TMC, we have seen increased demand to engage with both platforms. It's one of the reasons BondPoint volume was up over 30% in the first half. In addition, it's important to point out that prior to our acquisition, TMC was owned by some of the largest wealth management platforms in the world. This ownership created a conflict of interest prohibiting their wealth management arms from trading on the platform. That restriction has now been lifted at all three banks and their affiliates. And as a result, we expect new flow will be shown on the platform. In sum, we are uniquely positioned to leverage our technology, our content and our distribution, and we look forward to updating you as we grow the business, expand margins and drive shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Thank you, Ben. Good morning to everybody on the call. I'll start on slide 9. I'll begin by expanding on what you just heard from Ben. This morning we announced an innovative solution addressing some of the workflow inefficiencies in the fixed income, exchange traded funds market. Fixed income ETFs have grown rapidly over the past decade, growth that we believe is still in its early innings and growth that this newly announced infrastructure is designed to support. Working closely with BlackRock, the world's largest ETF sponsor, and leveraging ICE technology, data and trading infrastructure, we plan to establish a central trading hub that enables seamless connectivity for market participants to more effectively communicate and transact. While the system will be wholly owned and operated by ICE and connect to our BondPoint and TMC markets, it will be an open source platform made available to all market participants. With BlackRock serving as a development partner, we seek to create new standards and new protocols to streamline the front to back office workflows and to bring together transparency and efficiency to the ETF marketplace. Another example of product innovation directly sourced from our customer dialogue is our recently announced partnership with Magellan Midstream Partners, one of the leading providers of pipeline infrastructure, storage and distribution of crude oil. This September following regulatory review, we expect to launch a physically delivered Permian WTI contract with offtake in Houston. The legacy WTI benchmark at Cushing, Oklahoma is an important market for U.S. crude oil in the Midcontinent, but it is a landlocked benchmark with growing quality concerns. This is evidenced by the price divergence between Brent crude and WTI Cushing crude which has recently widened to as much as $11. Conversely, crude that makes its way to Houston usually trades at only a $2 to $3 locational discount to Brent crude. Our Permian WTI contract offers a solution serving the increasing demand for an exportable North American crude benchmark of predictable quality and delivery in a location that commercial customers tell us that they desire. Permian WTI will also complement our Brent crude franchise as, once it hits the water, crude from Houston joins an array of other global crude oils that price against the seaborne Brent global benchmark. In our interest rate markets, we're working with customers and regulators to launch alternatives to LIBOR. Consistent with our mission to provide an array of options and solutions, we now offer one-month and three-month SONIA futures. While still in their early days, we've seen signs of success with traded gross notional value reaching \u00a3128 billion this week as investors and traders gravitate to the largest marketplace for UK and European interest rate futures. In addition, this October we plan to launch one-month and three-month SOFR contracts to round out our global interest rate offering. In our equities markets, we launched NYSE National during the quarter, which we have repurposed into a taker-maker pricing model. National runs on Pillar, a proprietary technology that we've been rolling out across our equity venues. Consistent with our broader vision, both NYSE National and Pillar bring greater efficiency, execution quality, and choice to our customers. This commitment to our customers and the market quality in which they list and trade is why we also have opposed some elements to the SEC's recently proposed transaction fee pilot. We appreciate and we encourage the SEC to consider holistic U.S. equity market reforms including the reform of the rebate model. However, while this proposal is called a pilot study by the SEC, in reality, we're troubled by what appears to be an experiment that involves all public companies listed on U.S. exchanges. And it's an experiment that doesn't consider the 40% of volume that trades off exchange, where much of the important broker data that the SEC is looking to collect is actually located. It's beyond ironic that an agency of the U.S. government is proposing to establish price controls on market making in what is the most admired free market. This is why we continue to encourage the SEC to make modifications to its recent proposals. Let me conclude my remarks on slide 10. We have built a platform that cultivates and scales innovation, a platform that embeds our solutions into our customer workflows and drives long-term growth for our shareholders. For many of our customers, data drives trading which in turn creates the information used in post-trade functions, which feeds into the future pre-trade decision making. It's a virtuous cycle and our global ecosystem of exchanges, clearing houses, information and connectivity is difficult to replicate. So I'd like to end by thanking our customers for their business and for their trust in the quarter. And I want to thank my colleagues for the efforts that contributed to another strong quarter for ICE. I'll now turn the call back to our moderator, Andrea, to conduct the question-and-answer session, which will run until 9 :30 Eastern Time. Andrea? Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question will come from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan: Hi. Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. Jeff, I think the topic du jour among investors happens to be volumes and volumes have been particularly tepid across asset classes more recently. Clearly, there is seasonality and volatility has declined across multiple asset classes. So, there's definitely elements of seasonality and cyclicality here. I guess, my question is, what are your thoughts on secular shifts in global trading? Are you seeing any sort of underlying shifts in trading behavior that's changing the longer-term rate of volume growth for your futures, equities and fixed income businesses? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: And that's a really good question. The short answer is no, we're not seeing that. But every asset class is slightly different. Obviously, I think you've covered us for years and one of the interesting things that we find about our physical commodities business, which in other words our oil and agriculture and metals business, is that those tend to be tied to supply chain issues, the volatility that affects supply chains. And there are a lot of volatility issues that are acts of God, and so they tend to not \u2013 they tend to be long-term structural issues just in the ecosystem of moving goods and services around the world. And so those markets have performed well. That's why I think we've had 21 consecutive record years in oil trading. And there's no end to that. Other markets that you mentioned; equities, fixed income, in other words, bonds and certain financial commodities, interest rates and the like, are very much driven by Central Bank policy and acts of humans. And they're global as well. And there seems to be no end to the act of humans right now in coming out of the end of the financial crisis and trying to return to some sense of normalcy in central banks, and various countries including the United States refining their trading policies around the world as the economy recovers. And so we go through fits and starts in those due to acts of man, but my own \u2013 I'm bullish long term because there's a lot of change going on in the world and essentially these products are used to help manage the risk of that change. Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: And Ken, I know you are a numbers guy, so I think the other thing that's support to what Jeff's saying is if we were seeing secular shifts away you wouldn't see open interest in oil up 11% and open interest in ags up 17% and open interest in rates up 11%. And the other thing that I'm encouraged by because, again, it's always to me been a leading indicator of ongoing interest in our markets, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, if you set aside the audit from the prior year, our futures exchange data in the quarter was up 4% year-over-year. And that's not price. That's customers. That's more people interested in oil market, that's more people starting to think about Houston as the place for physical oil in the U.S. So I definitely \u2013 not only do we not see it qualitatively; quantitatively, we're not seeing any shift either. Operator : Our next question comes from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Yeah. Good morning, guys. I guess my question is first about the crude oil announcement that you made, Jeff. I'm just trying to understand as a non-energy guy but trying to understand that if it should only be a $2 price difference and it's wider with the problem and how do you solve that? I guess you went through that but I just want to understand a little bit more clearly? And then to tie it into a little bit something more, tie it to current revenues and earnings is the \u2013 you've talked before about natural gas being negative byproduct of crude. The natural gas volumes are really hitting blows and I guess could you give a better explanation of that if it isn't \u2013 if you can give a better explanation of the natural gas volume you're experiencing right now? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Sure. I think first of all, I should say I was not an exchange guy until I started this company, so I guess you could argue whether or not I'd become one. But the fact you're not an energy guy is not something that's going to defer you from coming to the right answer. And I mean that as a compliment. So historically, the United States price of oil in the United States has been benchmarked to West Texas intermediate crude at Cushing, Oklahoma, which is landlocked as I mentioned. It's a very good tradable contract because there are lots of idiosyncrasies around moving oil in and out of this landlocked area. You need pipes and storage and the like to actually feed refineries and work with the commerce of the United States. So that contract particularly lends itself to speculative traders that really enjoy studying these permutations and benefiting from the knowledge of flows around Cushing, Oklahoma. But as you alluded to, there's been a fundamental change in where we discover oil in the United States and with the advent of fracking. And much of that oil is not connected to the systems that lead to Cushing, Oklahoma. And increasingly, because we're creating a surplus of oil in many areas, some of that oil is being exported. And it's being exported by getting it down to the Gulf of Mexico and putting it on ships and sending it overseas. And ICE has really built our energy business by catering to commercial customers and commercial customers tell us that they've been frustrated by the ability to hedge their new fracking oil businesses with the legacy WTI Cushing, Oklahoma benchmark. And there is some basis trading that goes on, financial basis trading that does exist in the OTC markets. But what our customers tell us, the commercial customers, is that they would really like a physically delivered contract which is how they're used to dealing with oil in the United States with the benchmarks. And they really like it in the Houston area and that will then create a more representative price of U.S. oil, if you will, and will also allow them to either use that oil price benchmark for internal hedging or, if they choose to, export. And as I've mentioned on other calls, the price in Houston more accurately reflects the price of oil around the world because the price of oil around the world is really oil that is moving from the Middle East or from Russia and elsewhere to areas of population growth, and so it tends to be seaborne. And therefore, there will be a very nice trading hedge, if you will, between Brent oil which is seaborne oil, and Permian oil at Houston which can be seaborne oil. And the price difference, generally speaking, will be the price of transportation and will allow people to hedge shipping cost by the delta price. And of course, there will be times when there will be hurricanes and other acts of God that will affect shipping and people will be able to hedge out that risk on that kind of basis trade. So long story short, that contract really is being desired by a lot of our customers who helped us stand it up, helped us arrange the relationship with Magellan and create the infrastructure for delivery. So we have high hopes for it. And we know that a lot of our commercial customers are anxious for it to begin to trade. You're right in that one of the byproducts of discovering oil in shale is natural gas and many of the these new shale areas don't have particularly good infrastructure for selling that natural gas for putting it into the natural gas systems in the United States. And as such many people literally are almost giving that gas away. So the marginal price of natural gas in the United States has fallen, as the increase in oil production has risen, which is an interesting phenomenon. The benchmark for natural gas in the United States, Henry Hub, is in Louisiana. And similarly it is not necessarily a great benchmark for the new infrastructure of natural gas that is being discovered. That being said, the market has been working on basis trades around the gas business. And because the price of gas is so low they don't really necessarily need to hedge in the way that they did before. So overall, Henry Hub volumes and natural gas volumes have fallen and we expect honestly that as long as the U.S. remains an active oil producer that that will be the case. We do think there will be more infrastructure builds over time because we think this is a permanent change the way the United States gets energy. And so we think some of these basis hubs may become primary trading hubs as opposed to the Henry Hub, but the market has yet to determine that. Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: And just again, to put a couple of numbers around that, kind of harkening back a little bit to is it secular or not, Jeff talked about the commercials are a lie for natural gas. Over the last three years, it's growing 13% a year on average. That's twice what you are seeing at one of our peers. And in addition to that, if you look at the basis market, our volumes are actually up 20% year-over-year in the first half. And so again, if you step back and think about where the commercials are and how they're hedging their risk, which is where the sustainable growth is going to come from and where you see an open interest growth, we're very confident in the natural gas platform we've built. And that's the U.S. statement. Then you add on top of that, that our European natural gas footprint is doing really well, particularly our index business, that we bought a number of years ago, volumes and revenues in that business are trending positively in the year. So we've long talked about the global nature of the natural gas franchise that we have, the commercial orientation. And I think what you see in our ability to grow energy revenues, despite the volume decline you see in the U.S. natural gas business, all relates to the global commercial nature of the franchise we've established. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Carrier of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Thanks, guys. Scott, maybe just one on the guidance, and this is more in the expenses. So I can see on the core a bit lower. Just on the acquisition, both when I look at the revenues, the expenses and in the interest expense, it seems like they're probably coming in roughly breakeven. Just wanted to get some sense on what's the maybe outlook on like the growth profile of the kind of the acquisition revenues. And probably just bigger picture, when I think about going into 2019, 2020 giving the lot of the focus on fixed income, what or maybe some of the key like drivers that you think can maybe extend the growth rate over the coming years? Benjamin R. Jackson - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Thanks, Michael, for the question. This is Ben Jackson. I'll try to unpack some of the questions you had there. On the acquisitions, I'll start with that. I think the way to think about it is really of two difference transactions. So first you have the Chicago Stock Exchange. That business is going to be fully integrated into our New York Stock Exchange platform. The way to think about that business in terms of size back half of this year is just approximately $8 million in revenue with $8 million in expense. So if you double that plus a little bit that gives you an idea of what that business is on a full year basis. As I said, that business is going to be fully integrated into the New York Stock Exchange. Scott also mentioned that there's some severance expense [Technical Difficulty] (35:07-38:37) Operator : Pardon me, everybody. And I will allow the speakers to continue where they left off. Benjamin R. Jackson - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Thank you. Thank you for rejoining us to the call. And apologies to those of you out there on the call being dropped there. So I'll pick up on the question that was asked that had multiple parts to it. And I'll just start over with where I was going with the answer. So, first on the acquisition, so the way to think about them is they're two different acquisitions. So the first being the Chicago Stock Exchange and the Chicago Stock Exchange business is a business that's going to be fully integrated into the New York Stock Exchange on New York Stock Exchange technology over time. That business is roughly $8 million in revenue at the back half of this year with $8 million in expense. If you double that plus a little bit more it gives you an idea what that business is on a full year basis. Scott also mentioned in his comments about severance back half of this year. We have already enacted in our integration plan so some subset of that severance is related to some of the immediate restructuring we did of the Chicago Stock Exchange business. And that will end up leading to about a 30% reduction in expenses on the Chicago Stock Exchange business excluding severance when you roll forward into calendar year 2019. So that's that business. Separately, when you think of the TMC business, the TMC business is a business we're really excited about. It'll be alongside our BondPoint business and there's a number of reasons that we're excited about these types of execution businesses. So both BondPoint and TMC, they're more central order book trading businesses whereas the vast majority of fixed income execution platform, electronic execution platforms that are out there are more RFQ oriented. And RFQ as a protocol is much easier to support. It's basically think of it as almost email facilitation compared to building a true central order book where you have millions of quotes being streamed into your markets on both the buy and the sell side being able to support that. In terms of the TMC business, we are going to be integrating that with BondPoint. The way to think of those two businesses as a combined entity is that it's approximately $100 million business with $40 million in operating profit and there's significant growth opportunity for both. We've already seen the growth in the BondPoint business with the BondPoint business up in terms of volume to 33% this year. Also on BondPoint, we've seen new connections more than double-digit connections from new entities connecting into it with more than half of those connections being with buy sides. Other things to point out that we look at that's very interesting on platforms like BondPoint and the trend is very similar with TMC is that we're seeing a significant amount of growth in odd-lot trading. To define what odd-lot trading is, odd-lot trading is trades that have an average of more than 100 bonds per trade that are associated to it. A lot of people think of these platforms as though they're micro lot trades which is less than 100 bonds per trade. One of the fastest areas of growth we've seen on the BondPoint platform and TMC is also seeing that is in this odd-lot trading, the trades that have more than 100 bonds per trade and that in BondPoint grew by more than 50% in the first half. The other thing we've seen is the streaming prices. The depth of the market continues to grow, more streaming prices are coming into the markets and that streaming is happening up with both buyers and sellers. We're seeing an equal amount of quoting on both buyers and sellers in the platform and TMC is seeing similar trends. The other thing I'd point out on TMC on the revenue side that's an interesting growth opportunity that I mentioned in the prepared remarks is that you have to remember that that platform was owned by three major banks : Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and Citi. These are some of the largest private banks and wealth advisors in the space. As a result of the significant ownership that those three banks had with TMC, that created a conflict of interest where they could not send \u2013 there literally was a stop sign that they could not send nor could their affiliates send their flow to the TMC platform. Well, I'm happy to say that we're just over a week from being closed and that restriction has been lifted at all three banks and their affiliates, so it's an obvious sign there's pent up demand to get access to the robust liquidity pool that TMC provides. And we look forward to that revenue flowing to this business soon. As part of the integration plan, so we are going to bring \u2013 because they're two central order book trading platforms, we are going to be bringing those platforms together, but we also acknowledge that the protocol associated to how bonds are executed in each is different. So what we'd like to and where we're heading towards is creating a single connection for our clients to connect into our platforms, but get access to the two different liquidity pools respecting the fact that TMC has come up primarily in the municipal space as an anonymous platform and BondPoint has come up primarily in the corporate space with post trade name give up. The last piece I'll hit, there was another question around just our strategy and the trends here. And one of the things we're really excited about that came from the announcement this morning is our strategy which Jeff has termed in the prepared comments as a virtuous circle around how pre and post trade analytics data and execution all comes together. The announcement this morning on the BlackRock opportunity, we see a clear sign of that strategy coming to life because this is an opportunity for us to partner with a leading ETF market participant in BlackRock to create a new innovative solution, a platform that will be open to ETF market participants that will help reduce the inefficiency and friction that exist in the fixed income create redeem process. This is a rapidly growing area of the industry. And when you look into that the details of how execution happens in that primary market trading you'll find that it's very manual we have disconnected systems, disconnected instant messaging systems from order management and execution systems, those are disconnected to execution venues. There's no standards on the protocols with which how these industry tools connect. And ICE is in a unique position we found from working with BlackRock with our combination of reference data, ETF constituent data, pricing data, instant messaging and our recently acquired execution platforms in BondPoint and TMC to help solve this challenge. So we're excited the BlackRock is a committed development partner for this. We look forward to reaching out to more industry participants to advance this effort. I think that's just one sign of things to come. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sach. Please go ahead. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey. Thanks for taking the question. So just building maybe on the credit build out topic, can you guys give us a sense of whether you \u2013 given the acquisitions you've made recently, are you sort of at the size and scale in terms of capabilities or should we expect you guys to do more bolt-ons? And I guess as larger deals become available to sort of really accelerate growth here, should we expect you guys to kind of follow your historical M&A targets which I think you tried to get things on a EPS accretion by the end of the first year or there might be change for something larger in terms of near term dilution versus kind of like longer-term strategic vision? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yeah. Alex, this is Jeff. It's a good question. Nothing has changed in terms of our outlook. I think if you think back about how we've been talking about the fixed income marketplace, we've been pretty diligent about the things that we've acquired and the things that we're building to bring those pieces together. We've talked pretty openly about the fact that we think the opportunity is in the fact that the workflow and fixed income is very clumsy and spaces evolving quickly and that there are gaps that we can fill. And by buying a pricing business than building out ourselves or reference data business than buying an index business than building out ourselves a self-indexing capability then buying a muni platform and buying a corporate platform and now tying all that together with our instant messenger and network, we think we have a powerful set of infrastructure tools that equip us well with the growth that's happening in that space and help drive the next leg of how trading and pricing and infrastructure will develop. So we don't necessarily need anything and the next leg, as Ben has talked about, is us tying all that together and making it easily accessible to the marketplace. We always look for unique bolt-on opportunities that will give us a buy versus build advantage, so that we can get to market faster. And certainly, some of the things, I just mentioned, really helped us to get to where we are today much faster. And we always look for unique opportunities that can be transformative. But as you've indicated they have to fit within our M&A discipline. And the people that I'm sitting with here, none of us enjoy running large companies. We hate bureaucracy, but what we love is growth, EPS growth. And so, if we can find something that won't change the culture of our firm in the long run, but will help our EPS growth, we'll always look at it. Those are difficult, particularly as people like you have really spent a lot of time in our space and written on various companies and very good companies tend to be priced as very good companies and are hard for us to acquire and we've got discipline. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. Scott, just a quick one on the guide, a nice step up in data revs for 4Q. I'm just wanting to know is that a good jumping off point as we think about 2019 or is there some perhaps seasonality in that number which might lead to a tick down in the first quarter of next year? Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: No. It's a good question, and I appreciate the compliment on the guide. It's a business that we feel really good about. We've seen sequential improvements from first quarter to second quarter. We'll see it in the third quarter. We will see it in the fourth quarter. And they're not a seasonal boost that we are getting in the fourth quarter. What you're seeing is the build in ASV. You look at the first quarter growth of around 5% adjusted for the audit fee from the prior year would have been around 5% in the second quarter. But ASV sits at 6%. And what we've said is in the back half of the year, we think we will grow data revenues at least 6%, and so that's really pointing you towards what the overall, I guess, path is in terms of revenue. So not seasonal, reflective of the building ASV. By the time we get to the end of the year, the nice thing will be the Bank of America Merrill Lynch indices, which are up 50% from where they were a year ago, but on accounting it all towards organic growth right now, will start to count. And so that's a tailwind. As we move into 2019, growth in that business will start to fully count towards organic growth. And so we're pleased with how the business has trended. We're pleased with where it's headed now and I think 2019 sets up to be another good year. Operator : Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt of KBW. Please go ahead. Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. I just I guess one on LIBOR. I guess, during the quarter some of the global regulators reiterated their prior stance that LIBOR must be migrated to alternative more transaction-based benchmarks. Just curious if we could get some updated thoughts on LIBOR as a viable benchmark longer-term. Because a couple of quarters ago, it sounded like you and maybe some other market participants were optimistic on the future of LIBOR and potentially making some changes to the calculation methodology that could prolong the license viability of the benchmark. But now every regulators is pushing back. So any thoughts there will be great. Thanks. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Sure. There's no question that regulators continue to urge the market to look for alternatives for new business. And to try to figure out if historical business there are contractual ways of migrating the historical business that is benchmark to LIBOR to other rates. And the market is responding and we've been responding. We see it as an opportunity and that's why we've launched SONIA and about to launch SOFR futures and those have actually been doing well. And you can imagine people that are supporting those are many of the people that are regulated and have been urged to get on with developing new alternatives. On the LIBOR side, LIBOR has increasingly become more rooted in transaction business and less rooted in estimates. And there is a white paper published by a large group that ICE is administrating that is overseeing LIBOR on how it will migrate and that migration is going well. The migration is basically away from estimates and to transactions. And so we think LIBOR will be a very good safety net that that contract for the legacy business that won't be able to transition and for new business that will have difficulty adopting some of these new benchmarks in the early days, there will be a safety net there. And we're confident that we can make that contract, that index more robust and give it my confidence than it had in the past. So it's kind of a double-edged strategy that we have and going well on both sides honestly. And a lot more serious activity and discussion about these alternatives in the last quarter than there had been leading up to it. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Kramm of UBS. Please go ahead. Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. Hey, good morning, everyone. Wanted to come back to the data guidance and outlook, Scott. And by the way, first of all, thanks for some of the incremental disclosures. It's really helpful. But I just wanted to compare the previous guidance with the new guidance. So I think for the full year, previously, you said 6% or 7% organic and I know this included currency beforehand. But even then, I think you said even without currency, should be at the 6%. So now you're saying 5% to 6%. You mentioned a couple of items like the audit fees and also the implementation. But just wondering if you could highlight any other things that maybe have been running a little bit slower. I know you've been very excited throughout the year. And in particular I think some people thought Europe and MiFID II could draw some upside. So just wondering if you think it fell short in some areas and identify those. And just related to that real quick, can you just remind us, TMC and the national exchange, are there market data feeds that are coming in now as well from the acquisition? Could you give us a million dollar number on that too as well? Thanks. Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: I can't give you a million dollar number because it won't add up to that. So it's not \u2013 those aren't really data plays. But let me step back, Alex. It's a good question. It's a fair question. We did say coming into the year 6% to 7%. I did adjust that now to say 5% to 6%. But let's put that in perspective. So we are about 0.8 point off what we thought coming into the year on a $2.1 billion business, which means we are off around $16 million to $18 million give or take a little bit. I noted earlier the Bank of Merrill Lynch indices, that business has grown 50%. I'm not taking any credit for that $6 million or $7 million mitigating it, but it's why in the quarter and in the guidance you see that from an absolute dollar standpoint, we're right where people expect us to be. And so if you kind of net it all up, I talked about it in my prepared remarks, there are a couple of places where we're a little bit short versus what we thought coming into the year. The first place I mentioned is the second quarter. We saw some delays in some connectivity implementations. The good news is what that means is contracts that would have run 2Q this year to 1Q of next year, will run 3Q of this year to 2Q of next year. So, no revenue lost in total, just a little bit of a slip out here that's a few million bucks. More importantly and this won't surprise you, our overall desktop revenues are coming down a little faster than we expected. That's consistent with what you are seeing in the industry. People really don't want the desktops anymore. They prefer the direct feed. And we've got a retail platform, eSignal, that really is not an optimal platform and not particularly strategic and we're off a few million dollars there. And then the last thing, again, it won't come as a surprise to you is our NYSE Tape data is a little bit softer than what we thought coming into the year. So again in a $2.1 billion business, we've got a few areas, three areas to be specific for a few million dollars mitigated by a really strong index performance that isn't reflected in the organic growth. And then you take a step back and say okay now you talk to me about 10% of the business, tell me about the 90%. The 90% of the business is pricing and analytics which is going to grow 7% for the year. I's connectivity and feed that's going to grow 7% for the year. It's an exchange data business on a futures side that you can go back and run the growth rates over the past few years, it's a good grower. It doesn't grow every single year. But over the course of two to three years, it's a good grower as well. So that's 70%, 85% of our revenues right there and we're putting up good numbers in the year. And by the way, talk about the guidance, we said 7% coming into the year on pricing and analytics, and connectivity and feeds and I'm telling you it's still 7%. So we feel good about the overall performance of the data business. Yes, in total, we're probably $8 million to $10 million light of where we thought we'd be versus the $2.1 billion forecast coming in. But overall, we have very strong confidence in where this business is positioned, the ASV being up 6%, pricing and analytics, and connectivity and feeds ASV being up 7%, so we feel good about the guidance we gave in the back half of the year, the acceleration in the growth in the back half of the year. And as I indicated earlier in response to the question, a continued acceleration as we move into 2019. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: And Alex, just to put a point on of the things that Scott said is, we've been \u2013 being more transparent about the data that comes out of the New York Stock Exchange. The large exchange groups, I think, created the false perception that somehow equity data was becoming more valuable. And the reality is, if you look at the long term trends, it's becoming cheaper and less valuable. And you could still read people that write articles that somehow equity exchange data is going up or that somehow there's pricing power in that area and not robust competition. The reality is that that's been in long-term decline. We expect that that's going to be the case long term. We expect that the market's going to continue to get cheaper for that data. As we all know you can go on your smartphone and you can look up a realtime stock price for free now and that is the long-term trend. So we've just been more open about pulling that out so that we can change the narrative that exists in the industry that this is not what people believe it is this is not an area of pricing power and growth. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks very much. Good morning, folks. Also thanks for the additional transparency. It's really helpful. Maybe just for Ben. And also thanks for your description of the fixed income. I just want to make sure I have it right and get your view on sort of near-term growth there. So we're looking at fixed income trading in its entirety being in the third quarter \u2013 starting in the third quarter roughly at $100 million annualized run rates. And it looks like about in rough numbers $50 million from TMC, maybe about $25 million from BondPoint, about $25 million then from the legacy \u2013 the CDS trading business. So first if you can sort of confirm if that's right. And then as you think about the organic things that you mentioned of how you're improving that fixed income trading including getting that new flow from the wealth management clients that weren't able to do that before, how should we think about that revenue from just those things and not the market broadly, growing into 2019 or is that already in your run rate? And then also if you could just comment on the BlackRock initiative when that starts and when that will start contributing from a revenue perspective? Benjamin R. Jackson - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Sure. Thank you, Brian, for the question. So as I've mentioned the combined business and we're just talking about BondPoint and TMC when I say that and, today, as it stands on an annualized basis, those businesses are $100 million in revenue with $40 million in operating profit. As I have mentioned, there's some growth opportunities, in particular on the TMC side, that we believe are quite interesting from just the affiliate revenue, sub-custody revenue with the restrictions being lifted on those significant major banks in the wealth advisory space and in the private banking space that I had mentioned. The fact that that restriction has been lifted already and, again, we've just closed a little over a week ago is I think a great sign that there is pent-up demand that wants to interact with that liquidity and with that flow. So if you look at that revenue flowing into the business, you look at the integration \u2013 the view towards integration that I had given some color on a little bit earlier of creating a single connection point so the customers can get access to both liquidity pools, I see that over near term that margins of these combined businesses will get in line with our other exchange businesses. In addition to that, so you asked a question about the BlackRock opportunity, so the ETF create/redeem platform with BlackRock as a development partner and that opportunity has a number of areas for revenue generation for that new company that'll be a wholly owned subsidiary of ICE. As you think about it, there's areas of opportunity for that to generate revenue in the creation and redemption of process and just order-taking. You have instant messaging in there. You have data. You have pre and post trade analytics. You have services for authorized participants. You have connectivity to execution platforms like ours and execution that would flow from that as well as third-party execution platforms, connectivity to third-party order management systems and execution management systems and analytics system such as Aladdin, as well as other third-parties. So there is a great opportunity there in a number of different areas to not only for this new company to generate revenue, but also to solve a real need for the industry as the growth trajectory that I'd mentioned before is expected to continue into the future. And these investments are needed for the ETF market participants to continue to help enable that growth to continue. The platforms we're expecting to come live and start in 2019. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And just to clarify then, the CDS trading is over and above that $100 million and the initiatives on the wealth management side are also \u2013 will be incremental to that $100 million of BondPoint, of TMC? Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: So it's Scott. You've got a bit of an overinflated view of what we're doing in terms of credit x-revenue. So I think Ben is right in discussing TMC and BondPoint as around $100 million. You add in all the pieces together, it's only a little above that. So I think if you think about our bond businesses as a starting point at around $100 million business and, as Ben said, lots of growth opportunity on the top line and more importantly, in the near term, lots of opportunity to expand margins. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Herbert of Citi. Please go ahead. Ben Herbert - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Jeff, just wanted to get your take on cross border regulatory coordination and just if you get a sense that it has improved at all over the course of the year or might improve going forward? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: I guess I'm a glass-half-full guy so I'll take the I think it might improve going forward. But we're at a very difficult inflection point right now globally in the middle of the Brexit negotiations and in the middle of renegotiation of trade policies around the world. And so there's friction that filters down through government systems through their various regulators trying to figure out how to work in a global marketplace. We spend a fair amount of time on a day-to-day basis going through these various changes. It's dynamic and happening in real-time. Honestly, we feel good about the decisions we made to distribute our network around the globe. We have a regulated trading venue and clearing house in London. We have a separate regulated trading and clearing venue on Continental Europe, separate regulated trading and clearing venues in the United States and also same thing in Asia. And a lot of the work we do is talking to our customers, trying to figure out what their thinking is and where various businesses may move if some of the worst case scenarios come to pass. And fortunately, there really hasn't been a change in business. We're still growing and business remains relatively interrupted but there are a lot of contingency plans inside my company and inside all of our customers on where things might have to land going forward. And we feel really comfortable with the position we're in because all of those platforms are on the same technology. And for us moving really means moving files and moving interconnections and not so much moving people in the way you would think about some of our customers being threatened. So I'm optimistic but we really are kind of at our pinch point and I expect that that might go on for the next two quarters right now. I also expect personally that it will impact foreign exchange rates as the market tries to figure out where economic flow will go. And so, Scott continues to try to guide you as best we can, on a constant currency basis. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeremy Campbell of Barclays. Please go ahead. Jeremy Campbell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys. I know we're near end of time here, so I appreciate it. So a quick one. Ben, I think you highlighted in your color a lot of the different touch points that you guys are going to have with BlackRock here. So when we think about the revenue opportunity, it sounds like the partnership is going to be kind of additive on the transaction side. But when you think about the data side of the coin, can we think about BlackRock really kind of accelerating data growth at all over the next kind of two to three years or is it just one of those extra contributing factors to keep that growing at your long-term guidance kind of mid to high-single-digit? Benjamin R. Jackson - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yes, Jeremy, thanks for the question. And as I've mentioned just over the past comments, there's a number of different areas that this new company which will be a wholly owned subsidiary of ICE would earn revenues. So you have transaction revenues as it relates to the order-taking of creation and redemption. You've got execution that can happen on our trading platforms. But you also have recurring revenue that would take the form of connectivity into this standardized messaging system that's interconnecting all these participants in the ETF marketplace. You've got also data that's associated to this in connectivity to third-party EMS, OMS systems, including Aladdin and others and also other third-party execution platforms that will be on there. So it will be a mix of both recurring revenue that'll be associated to this as well as execution revenue opportunity. And the other thing to point out is that BlackRock is a committed development partner into this. We are reaching out to. And since the press release came out this morning, our team has been inundated with very positive phone calls and feedback from other market participants that we're welcoming to participate in this important effort to help create these standards that will hopefully lubricate the type of growth that this business has seen historically, and lubricate that that growth can continue into the future. The other thing I'd point out is that in June, BlackRock filed to switch to our benchmarks as part of ICE Data Services for four of their largest corporate ETFs. So we see a trend there as well where we can provide services towards major index providers to utilize our data in support of their fixed income self-indexing efforts. Operator : This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Sprecher for any closing remarks. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Thank you, Andrea. Thank you all for your participation this morning. Thanks for dialing back in after the call was cut. Sorry, I apologize for that inconvenience. And we look forward to speaking with you in October when we are going to report our results for the third quarter. Have a good morning. Operator : The conference has now concluded. We apologize for the connection loss during today's call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. And you may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Warren Gardiner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Warren Gardiner - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Good morning. ICE's third quarter 2018 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the theice.com. These items will be archived, and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements which we undertake no obligation to update represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2017 Form 10-K. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures including adjusted income, EPS, operating income, operating margin, expenses, tax rate, organic revenue and EBITDA. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more effective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent non-GAAP term to GAAP term in the earnings materials and explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful; as well as how management uses these measures in our Form 10-Q. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction based expenses, and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain items. Also, with us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Ben Jackson, our President. I'll now turn the call over to Scott. Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Thanks, Warren. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll start on slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our third quarter performance. ICE's consolidated third quarter net revenues increased 5% year-over-year to $1.2 billion. Trading & Clearing net revenues were $558 million, up 7% year-over-year. Data & Listings revenues totaled $642 million, an increase versus last year of 6% on an organic constant currency basis. Adjusted operating expenses totaled $521 million for the quarter and adjusted operating margins were 57%. I'll pause here to note that in early October we exercised our option to acquire the remaining minority stake in MERS, which will be the foundation of ICE Mortgage Services. Going forward, ICE Mortgage Services will be reported in operating results and included in our Trading & Clearing segment. With the change, other income will be roughly $6 million lower in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. However, we now expect incremental fourth quarter revenue related to ICE Mortgage Services to be in the $17 million to $19 million range with associated expenses of $9 million to $10 million on top of our prior expense guidance. Continuing with the third quarter highlights, our adjusted tax rate was 21% in the quarter reflecting clarifications around U.S. corporate tax reform and other adjustments which drove a year-to-date true-up in our tax provision. Our adjusted year-to-date tax rate is 23% and we expect the fourth quarter adjusted tax rate to be between 23% and 24%. All of these factors helped generate adjusted earnings per share of $0.85, an increase of 16% from the third quarter of 2017. Through the first three quarters of 2018, operating cash flows have increased 23% to a record $1.7 billion. We've returned nearly 90% of that cash to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. And we continue to expect to deliver a record $1.7 billion to shareholders during 2018. Finally, please note that this morning we announced a new $2 billion buyback authorization beginning in January of 2019. This new authorization will provide us with capacity for buybacks over the next six quarters, and flexibility to act opportunistically should the need arise. And importantly, we expect to grow the dividend once again in 2019. Now, please turn to slide 5 where I'll provide an overview of our Trading & Clearing business. Trading & Clearing revenue increased 7% year-over-year in the third quarter. While third quarter volume trends were down versus last year, improvement in our futures and options RPC mitigated that impact. More importantly, open interest continued to trend higher through the third quarter and with one day remaining in October, open interest is tracking up 7% year-over-year and is near its highest level in over five years. This growth has been driven by strength across virtually every asset class. In oil, open interest is up 8% including WTI OI which is up 12%. For ag, open interest is up 14%. And finally, interest rate's OI is up 15% against the backdrop of continued uncertainty associated with Brexit, EU politics and further central bank action. As we have consistently said, open interest is a helpful guide for gauging the health of our markets and is proving to be a leading indicator of volume growth during volatile periods. And with the recent increase of volatility in many of our markets, you can clearly see the impact of that in the rebound in volumes during September and our strong volume growth in October. Overall, October futures and options ADV is tracking up 32% versus the prior year. ADV in our energy complex is up 15% year-over-year, led by strength in oil as well as natural gas, which is up 19% year-over-year. Ags and metal volumes are up 48%. And in our financials complex, interest rate volumes are up 53% year-over-year, while equity derivative volume, excluding the Russell contract is up over 75%. Now, let's move to slide 6 where I'll discuss the Data & Listings segment. Third quarter Data Services revenue grew 6% on an organic constant currency basis to $530 million. This result was consistent with our expectations entering the quarter, despite a small currency headwind and softness related to NYSE session fees within our connectivity business. As we have begun migrating customers to our new and more efficient Pillar technology, some have taken the opportunity to rationalize the number of trading session, a dynamic we expect will continue in the fourth quarter. Within Data Services, exchange data revenues were up 5% year-over-year on an organic constant currency basis. This was driven by Futures data growth of 6%, reflecting continued interest in our Futures market, even during periods of slower volume activity as in the third quarter. Moving to Desktops and Connectivity, revenue was up 3% on an organic constant currency basis. Desktop revenues declined versus the prior year, but stabilized sequentially. This was offset by Connectivity and Feeds revenues, which grew 4%, as the impact from the continued consolidation of our legacy network onto the ICE Global Network was mitigated by improved execution and new customer implementation and double-digit growth in our Feeds business. Finally, Pricing and Analytics revenues, which represent half of our data revenue and nearly a quarter of our total revenue, were up 7.5% on an organic constant currency basis. As you can see on the slide, this is an acceleration from 4% in 2016, 5% in 2017 and 6% in the first half of this year. Product innovation to meet customers' needs in an evolving market and regulatory environment continues to generate strength in our core pricing and reference data business. And importantly, ASV for pricing and analytics is tracking up nearly 8% year-over-year to start the fourth quarter, giving us confidence and a strong finish to 2018 and continued momentum entering 2019. Next on slide 7, you'll see the solid contribution from our NYSE business thus far in 2018. Total revenues associated with the NYSE are up 6% on an organic constant currency basis this year. Improved industry volumes and market share gains have yielded trading revenue growth of 8% through the third quarter. We believe that recent technology investments such as Pillar as well as additional trading solutions such as NYSE National and NYSE American, which provide unique liquidity and listing services to small cap growth companies, enhance our position in this very competitive market. Listings revenues on an organic constant currency basis have grown 6% in 2018. The NYSE remains the premier listing venue for global corporations raising over $25 billion in IPO proceeds year-to-date and has been the venue of choice for 23 of the last 25 IPOs over $1 billion. And finally, continued investment in both our data and connectivity solutions has helped drive 3% growth in NYSE Data Services revenue this year. Importantly, I'll note that total NYSE revenues, coupled with the business efficiencies we've delivered since our acquisition in 2013, helped generate strong cash flows that are enabling the record shareholder returns in 2018. In summary, October futures and options volumes in our trading business, which contribute around 30% of our total revenue, are up over 30% versus the prior year, and open interest continues to build and is up 7%. Our Pricing and Analytics revenue, which delivers nearly a quarter of our total revenue, will grow 7% this year. And ASV entering the fourth quarter is up nearly 8%. And the NYSE has grown 6% and is generating strong cash flows. All of this has combined to allow us to return a record amount of cash to our shareholders, even as we have spent over $1 billion in additional strategic initiatives to enhance our future growth. We're on track to finish 2018 on a strong note and positioned for continued success in 2019. I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A, but we'll now hand the call over to Ben to provide an update on our bond strategy. Benjamin R. Jackson - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Thanks, Scott, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'll begin on slide 8. As technology advances and the regulatory landscape evolves, fixed income market structure is transforming. Participants are increasingly looking for more efficiency and are challenging the traditional model. With our comprehensive suite of products and services, our growing portfolio of ETF and index solutions and connectivity to over 5,000 customers through our fixed income service offerings, we are uniquely positioned to address these needs and reduce the frictions that exist across the trade lifecycle today. The first example of this coming to life was the August announcement of our ETF primary trading initiative with BlackRock. The ETF create-redeem process is currently a disconnected workflow, sometimes taking hours, if not a full day, to complete. Leveraging our industry-leading pricing and reference data, portfolio analytics and our execution technology, we expect to bring to market the ICE ETF Hub, a tool that will improve participant productivity and lay down a foundation for this trillion-dollar industry to continue its robust growth. A second example has arisen this past quarter. In response to feedback from a number of large ETF sponsors and index fund managers, we launched a portfolio rebalancing service. The service is leveraging our customer network, pricing data, reference data and auction capabilities from ICE Credit Trade. Some of the world's largest asset managers have already utilized the product, which enables them to efficiently reposition a portfolio against a changing benchmark or to quickly absorb capital flows, while limiting trade friction and tracking error, particularly when those funds are benchmarked to indices underpinned by our leading pricing and reference data. The third and fourth examples are in response to customer demand in the growing area of electronic execution of micro and OddBot trading. These initiatives will include partnering and connecting to third party order management systems in order to streamline client workflows. Efforts are already underway with a number of providers, including Charles River and Aladdin. Finally, as the industry gains additional comfort with electronic trading, they are looking to combine the speed, liquidity and execution quality found in our well-established streaming price or click-to-trade protocols with RFQ functionality. While the underlying technology needs are relatively simple compared to our streaming price liquidity tools, RFQ is helpful for larger trade sizes and highly illiquid instruments. So we are working to enhance our existing RFQ capabilities which already represent close to 20% of our volume, and handle over 10,000 requests per day. And we will integrate this enhanced RFQ functionality into our robust all-to-all execution platform, which logged over 800,000 trades in the third quarter of 2018. And so as we look to 2019 and beyond, we see tremendous opportunity to partner with our customers to solve real challenges across this asset class, and I look forward to updating you on our progress in the future. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Thank you, Ben. Good morning to everybody. Before I begin on slide 9, I'd like to address certain issues surrounding the U.S. equity markets. Today, the U.S. equity markets offer the most advanced trading and most transparent data services in the world, services that are critical to market efficiency, resiliency and security and why the costs to trade U.S.-listed equities is the lowest in the world. Today, price information is available equally to retail investors for little to no cost, a direct result of competitive forces across the brokerage and exchange marketplace. And in fact, we believe that the NYSE data costs to the top five Wall Street banks is less than one half of 1% of the nearly $26 billion that they've generated in their equity-related businesses just so far this year. This is in stark contrast to the state of the equity markets only a few years ago, a state in which the exchanges were owned by many of those same banks and brokers and when access to data and information was discriminatory against those who were not the exchange owners. It was an era that many falsely romanticize. Today, the major U.S. equity exchanges are owned by the public and our for-profit status is a profits interest for the benefit of the public. Exchange managers, like my colleagues and me, are guided by discipline imposed by free competitive transparent markets. I've really been saddened at recent industry statements suggesting a disbelief in the power of public markets to guide balanced decision-making, suggesting that notwithstanding the rapid investor response of evolution of the U.S. exchanges over the last decade as public companies such free market capitalism is somehow thought not to be in the best interest of investors and our nation. The current rhetoric fails to acknowledge that it is competition that has caused the estimated total costs to trade for many of the New York Stock Exchange to be [over] 20% lower than a similar trade at the IEX exchange or 30% lower than some dark pools operated by Wall Street banks and brokers. It also fails to acknowledge the impact of our technology investments, which have improved cyber-security, reduced latency, and increased network capacity. In fact, the price per unit of bandwidth on our network is estimated to be 18% lower than it was just three years ago. At the same time, the consolidated tape known as the SIP now processes an estimated 20 times the number of messages as it did just 10 years ago, and peak messages on the public options tape known as OPRA are estimated to be up five times what they were only five years ago. And market participants have been the beneficiaries of the improved technology and economies of scale that come from operating multiple exchanges. These accomplishments were all the result of critical technology investments aimed at improving and advancing our public markets, which resulted from competitive public ownership of exchanges, not from regulatory fiat. And they're why we and the SEC are able to sit here today and unequivocally state that all Americans benefit from the most transparent and liquid capital markets in the world, a statement that I hope our regulators consider very thoughtfully before listening to those recommending that we regress to the policies and procedures from the flawed equity markets of a past era. Let me now shift to the other entrepreneurial growth initiatives that ICE prides itself on, a strategy that has driven value creation for our investors for over a decade. Applying technology information and expertise to a mission of bringing transparency and efficiency to markets is a playbook that we have run since our inception. And we see opportunity to apply that blueprint, not only to the fixed income markets that Ben just discussed, but also in areas such as mortgages and digital assets. This summer, we completed the technology build for MERS, and in early October, we exercised our option to purchase the remaining minority stake. If you're not familiar with MERs or as it will soon be called ICE Mortgage Services, it is an electronic data repository which tracks the changes in residential mortgage servicing rights and the beneficial ownership interests in the United States. Essentially, it is the DTCC for the U.S. mortgage market. Membership spans 5,000 banks, credit unions, servicers, investors and government agencies. And over the past 17 years, the number of loans registered has grown from 1 million to over 100 million, with over 75% of the newly originated U.S. residential loans being registered on the system. The mortgage market is now looking for efficiencies, and our goal is to help bring some of those efficiencies by electronifying parts of the mortgage workflow. Solutions such as our newly launched eNote and eVault offerings will help reduce paper costs and allow for greater oversight and control of what is a $10 trillion market. Another opportunity for growth is to help frame out the market for digital assets. We've long studied developments in both blockchain and cryptocurrencies, and in talking with our customers we saw a need for more institutional solutions. In August, we announced the formation of Bakkt which is a new company, designed to enable institutions and consumers to buy, sell, store and spend digital assets on a seamless platform. Bakkt is led by CEO, Kelly Loeffler, who many of you know from her past leadership roles at ICE, and includes a group of premiere partners including BCG, Starbucks, Microsoft and others. In its first phase, Bakkt will work with ICE's markets and clearing to deliver institutional-grade risk management, physical delivery and warehouse solutions that do not exist today. We're approaching this with a great deal of transparency and we've already gained approval from our Clearing House Risk Committee at ICE clear US. The digital asset risks will be in a segregated waterfall where the separate guaranteed fund is provided by Bakkt instead of the clearing members and we've set up the workflow in a manner in which bank and brokerage members do not have to take possession of crypto assets but are still able to serve their customers in this space. This type of infrastructure is critical to the growth and development of the nascent $200 billion asset class and for it to responsibly continue to innovate over time. This month, we announced that Adam White will be joining back as its Chief Operating Officer. Adam was one of the first employees at Coinbase and most recently served as their head of institutional markets. And in December, pending CFTC approvals, Bakkt plans to launch its first product, a daily physically-delivered Bitcoin future and a warehouse for storage that leverages the ICE technology and security infrastructure. Now, if you turn to slide 10, you'll see that uncovering these opportunities and executing on our strategy is why we've grown revenue and earnings for 12 consecutive years. And we lay the foundation for continued growth in the near term as evidenced by our year-to-date results. In the medium term with opportunities such as our new fixed income and ICE Mortgage Services products, and over the longer term with initiatives such as the FinTech innovation at Bakkt. I'd like to conclude my remarks by thanking our customers for their business and for their trust in the third quarter, and I want to thank my colleagues for their efforts that contributed to another very strong quarter for ICE. I'll now turn the call back to Carrie, our moderator, to conduct the question-and-answer session which will last until 9 :30 AM Eastern Time. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question will come from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Yeah, good morning, Jeff, and good morning, Scott. And first, thanks for the comments on the U.S. equity markets. It seems like there's a lot of distortion and thanks for the information on slide 7 because I think there's been a lot of extremely uninformed information out there on the exchange licenses. But anyway, let me just change the subject and go do something that's a little bit more optimistic on the fixed income side. I guess, Ben, you are looking at now \u2013 you've added the RFQ sort of model. And I was just trying to see what was the driver. Is this a recognition that RFQ is in place to stay? Or was it just \u2013 or that it will hold a certain portion of the electronic fixed income market? Or was it just because it's so easy to add to your capabilities right now? Benjamin R. Jackson - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Great question, and thanks, Rich. If you take just a quick step back, I think, at present, the market doesn't fully appreciate the comprehensive suite of services that we're providing to our customers across fixed income. But I'm pleased to say that our customers are starting to realize it. And that's why they're coming to us for solutions like the ETF hub that we've announced with BlackRock and that we've reached out to the industry, and we're getting fantastic response on that. We have the portfolio rebalancing service that we just launched this past quarter and have a large asset manager already utilizing it right out of the gate. But when you look at it, our strategy of connecting, integrating, and investing in market-leading assets across the fixed income landscape really helps our customers solve comprehensive problems that they're dealing with and inefficiencies that they're dealing with in fixed income, and it starts with pre and post-trade analytics. You have our golden record of reference data for bond terms and conditions. We are the trusted source for pricing, both end-of-day on millions of instruments as well as intraday. Our index and ETF expertise that started with NYSE and was bolstered significantly in fixed income through the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Index acquisition. And now with our execution venues, the ability for us to provide the choice of executing, whether it's via the efficiency of streaming protocols in highly liquid instruments or for relatively illiquid instruments, where RFQ may be the best option to get that price, or robust auction capabilities. What we're looking to do is to provide as much choice as possible for our customers to execute. And the reality is \u2013 and you hit it \u2013 is that RFQ is pretty easy to build. When you're building a streaming service, which is where these platforms such as BondPoint and TMC came from, you have to have the ability to handle \u2013 BondPoint, for example, handles 100 million price updates a day. That's substantial. You're dealing with streaming prices, where on BondPoint, 10,000 securities. If you go onto their screen, you can execute a single trade of 250 bonds on both sides. So you have this robust streaming protocol that's out there that people are choosing and is growing for us. But we felt that. And these platforms have already had an established RFQ mechanism. And we wanted to continue to provide that choice where the market so chooses. Operator : The next question will come from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. In terms of connectivity, it seems like the SEC focus on data could easily evolve to a more meaningful conversation about connectivity. Could you help us frame the part of your Desktop and Connectivity segment that could or does fall under the Exchange Act of 1934 or Reg NMS? And particularly the portion of your connectivity business, where your critics could suggest you're discriminating against access for trading? Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yeah, Ken. It's Scott. So our connectivity business, as we've said, is a single business that runs across the ICE Global Network. And so we report it as a single thing because it is a single thing. And we have customers who connect to us to trade at the NYSE. We have customers who connect to us to consume our data. We have customers who connect to us to trade in our futures markets. And so we look at it as a single business, if you will, and report it accordingly. And don't really see a need to break it down any further, particularly in a world where it was fairly clear in the remit from the SEC that they didn't challenge whether or not the prices were fair. They simply said, bring us more detail. And so we don't look at it as a business under threat or under pressure. We look at it simply as a business that may require us to provide a bit more information in the future. And one, I'll point out, that continues to see capacity growth. Our capacity growth on a year-to-date basis is up 12%. Jeff mentioned the cost per unit of capacity is coming down significantly, but the business overall continues to grow. So we run it as a single thing. We report it as a single thing. And that's what we'll continue to do. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Michael Carrier of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks, guys. Hey, Scott, maybe first one. Just on the volume backdrop. Obviously, October's been strong. You didn't give any update on the expense side. But just wanted to get your sense if we're in this environment and this \u2013 maybe not the October levels, but we're in a better volume backdrop over the next few quarters and into 2019. Like how should we be thinking about the incremental margin from the transaction part of the business? Just because it hasn't been the big driver of the growth. So I just wanted to get maybe an update on what it could mean for the margin. Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: It's a great question. For a part of our business that even though it's half our revenue, people seem to forget about. We've noted that over the last year, open interest has built and built and built and pointed people to \u2013 when volatility hits, volumes will be there. And directly to your question, why that's so powerful is because there is very little to no incremental expense that comes with that volume growth. And so the incremental margins are high. And so our expectation, as you've seen historically, is that as we deliver volume growth over 30% in October and as that runs through the rest of the fourth quarter \u2013 noting that it's the typical holiday quarter, and so you'll see some seasonal slowdown \u2013 that tremendous volume growth, that's based on really continued open interest growth, delivers with it high incremental margins. And so the expense growth that you'll see moving forward, as you said, we didn't update guidance because nothing really changed, other than we'll add $9 million to $10 million related to MERS, more than offset by $18 million to $20 million of revenue. But with regards to that Trading & Clearing business, as the volumes grow, the incremental margins are high, the overall margins will expand, and it really doesn't drive expense growth. Operator : The next question will come from Chris Allen of Compass Point. Please go ahead. Chris Allen - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC: Morning, guys. I just wanted to follow up on the fixed income side. Obviously, developing RFQ. You're looking to get bigger in the institutional side. Last quarter you gave us some color just in terms of the size of the executions done on BondPoint. Wondering if you can give us a follow-up on that? And then maybe speak to the impact on TMC as some of the largest wealth managers are now to trade the platform and any incremental impact they've had there? Benjamin R. Jackson - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yeah, so similar to \u2013 thanks for the question, Chris. Similar to the response I gave to Rich, I think the thing everyone needs to think about is the combination of our analytics assets, our reference data, our pricing assets, our index and ETF expertise as well as these execution protocols that we have through these trading platforms. And it's really the combination of these assets is where over time, as I'm updating you and I've been updating you on initiatives like the ETF hub and portfolio rebalancing, what's really bringing these institutional initiatives to life is the combination of all these assets that's enabling us to get there. To your direct question around performance of the businesses, so I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we had high volume of 800,000 trades in Q3 alone. That's across TMC and BondPoint. If you can think about that as being up double digits. So we're pleased with the growth that we see in these platforms and also the expansion into the institutional space through some of these strategic initiatives. Operator : The next question will come from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Scott, just wanted to clarify on the capital return. You guys have done a lot here in the first nine months. And I think your goal is $1.7 billion, I think you said for the year and you're already at $1.5 billion. So want to just \u2013 if that's an at least number and we can think about the opportunistic side of buyback and how we should think about capital return even into 2019 in terms of the priorities? Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yeah, it's a good question. We've consistently been at the $1.7 billion for the year and that's where I think we'll land. As you'll recall in the second quarter, coming off of our earnings call, the stock was under a bit of pressure that we felt was completely unfounded and we did move opportunistically and accelerated some of the share repurchase. Our authorization for this year is $1.2 billion. We'll spend that. We'll likely exhaust it, middle of this quarter give or take. Share \u2013 our dividend will grow to above $500 million this year. So that's where you get to the $1.7 billion. The nice thing about the new authorization of $2 billion is it shows \u2013 ours and, importantly, our board's continued view that our share price still seems to be disconnected a bit from true value. And so not only do we have the capability now over the next six quarters to grow our share repurchases, we have more flexibility if there are disconnects in the prices to move opportunistically. And so as we come into the February call, we'll give you an update specifically on the dividend which, as I said, we expect to grow again share repurchases, and exactly how much we would expect to spend during 2019. But I think the signal to you on the 2019 repurchase is we want to be positioned to continue to grow our cash returns, but also to be in a position to move in when the stock comes under unwarranted pressure. Operator : The next question comes from Alex Kramm of UBS. Please go ahead. Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Wanted to go back to MERS for a second. Thanks for the specifics there, Scott. But can you actually flush the revenue model out a little bit more for us going forward? I mean, I think if I'm correct, I think it's like $11, $12 per transaction kind of model today. So \u2013 but you're already capturing 75% of new originations. So is this basically the originations will go up? Or is there a different revenue model for backloading? And how could data fit in down the line? So basically, what should we be watching for as we try to model this business? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Alex, this is Jeff. It's a good question. So MERS right now, the way we think of it is a backbone that has unbelievable connectivity across the entire industry, and it's because of the legacy business that you mentioned, the legacy registration business that so many people have connected to MERS and use MERS, and if you buy a home or refinance now that you know the name MERS you'll look at your closing statement, you'll probably see that $10, $11, $12 charge on your closing statement for the basic registration. What we're working with the industry is to now take that backbone and add to it other services that can really digitize the mortgage market. The mortgage market in the United States is still very paper-oriented. Even though you may, with certain providers, do an online mortgage application, what you don't realize is behind the scenes, ultimately those things get printed out on the paper and are dealt with in paper form. So we launched two new services; an eNote services so that the note part of the mortgage can be digitized and the note itself can be kept in digital form. And then in eVault where that note could be actually held by MERS. Many of the large banks and mortgage providers have their own vaults and MERS would essentially have a pointer that would tell the market where the golden record is, even if it's not at MERS. But we've now launched an eVault service. What we've seen on eVault is an uptake by the small and mid-tier banks that are interested in a one-stop solution by MERS as they go digital. And increasingly, we're talking to them about how we could put these vaults inside our cyber layer, and inside our data centers and what have you, which have tremendous capabilities beyond the capacity of many, many small users. So those new initiatives are the things when we talk about digitizing the mortgage space that we'll be talking to you about. Not necessarily the legacy business. The legacy business is a fantastic business that allowed us to buy a company that is already generating profits now that we have the new platform in place. But it's really the future growth of the electronification that we'll be talking to you about. Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: And Alex, just to help a little bit with the model question. I think probably the best thing to do is to take the fourth quarter guidance and multiply by four to kind of think about that as the 2019 base. And then I think similar to Ben's comments on fixed income and Jeff's comments on ICE Mortgage Services, you look at that as the starting point with us building the strategy out through 2019 and then really generating growth into 2020, 2021, et cetera, which I think builds on our track record of investing today in new growth initiatives that will generate growth two, three, four years out. Operator : The next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for, I guess, all incremental data again on the NYSE data side of things. Scott, I think I heard you mention some choppiness in the NYSE session fees. Is it helpful to quantify, I guess, how much those are and whether or not that should impact in any sort of way your prior guide on market data? I think you guys had $538 million, $542 million for Q4? Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yeah. As I mentioned, that's largely actually a dynamic around the rollout of our Pillar technology. And that Pillar technology will make us \u2013 it has made us far more efficient from an expense base. It makes our security and uptime far better, our trading capabilities far better. But as we've rolled old technology to new technologies, some customers have taken the opportunity to rationalize the number of sessions that they have. And so that hit the third quarter a little bit. As I mentioned, I think it will continue into the fourth quarter just a couple million bucks in the quarter. And so it puts a little bit of pressure on the numbers. But overall, it's small in the scheme of things. It doesn't detract from the trends we've talked about, particularly the trends in pricing analytics which are very strong and accelerating and our futures exchange data, which was solid in the quarter. And our feeds business which I noted grew double digits. So the reality is our data business has a number of moving pieces. That's one of them that was a bit soft in the quarter and will be again in the fourth quarter. But I think the overall engine in the data services business is clicking pretty well. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: And maybe just another backdrop that I think all of you on the call that follow this financial services space are aware of, but just to state the obvious, there's been a consolidation in the exchange business by the large public company exchange operators. There's also been a consolidation in the market-making business. There's been a consolidation going on in the brokerage business where the large brokers have increased market share. There's been a consolidation going on in the ETF management business. Our financial services space in a digital world is consolidating and lowering overall transaction cost by putting scale against these digital systems. And you see it all across our industry. And ultimately, it's really massively lowered the cost of transacting business which is why we can say that the United States is the cheapest place to manage capital raising and equities in the world. Operator : The next question will come from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks very much. Maybe just to finish up the look at market data into the fourth quarter. The $538 million to $542 million. Thanks for the comments on the connectivity desktop side. Maybe if you can also talk about the contribution of the stronger futures data to the exchange data line within data as we move into 4Q. Clearly, the pricing analytics is also growing or accelerating, as you said, Scott. So as we look into 4Q, I guess should we expect a potential acceleration into that $538 million and $542 million with some potential upside given those trends or is the Pillar headwinds enough of a sort of a headwind to keep you in the bottom of that range? And then also, just any audits of collection data feeds in the exchange data bucket this quarter? Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yeah, look, audits are part of every quarter, frankly. And we've pointed it out when it's caused a particularly outsized impact on any given quarter. The fact that we didn't point to anything in the quarter doesn't suggest that there weren't any. It simply suggests that there weren't any that were unusually large as a kind of, if you will, a part of the run rate business. Look, I think overall \u2013 and I'm not going to focus just on the fourth quarter because we run the business over the longer term. I think what you should expect is to continue to see the data services business continue to accelerate quarter to quarter to quarter. And you see it in the absolute terms. You see it in growth terms. I mean you see it in the Pricing and Analytics business that has consistently grown. And as I noted, ASV for Pricing and Analytics is up 8% overall. Overall ASV is up between 6% and 7% ending the third quarter, entering the fourth quarter as well. So I think we've got strength across all of the businesses. You asked specifically about exchange data, good third quarter. The reality is that the futures exchange data we tend to get a little bit more out of the exchange data when the volume size is a bit little softer on some of our minimum commission fees. I don't expect that will continue into the fourth quarter because our volumes are great. And so it's interesting because it's a revenue dollar that doesn't go away. It's a revenue dollar that maybe doesn't show up in data, and does show up in trading. And from where I sit, it's the total revenue dollar that drops down to the total earnings which matters. And that's where we consistently deliver. So I wouldn't get too hung up on any single number in a given quarter. I'd look at the track record of growth every quarter in terms of revenue and earnings, consistent acceleration in the data business, great volume growth in the trading business. And I think an underappreciated contribution from the NYSE that we showed on slide 7 across the board. Operator : The next question will come from Jeremy Campbell of Barclays. Please go ahead. Jeremy Campbell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Thank you. Ben, I know you guys said that the response has been positive so far, but with the ETF hub, is this more of a, if you build it, they will come type platform. Or is there any sort of heavy-lifting on your end with some hurdles to clear to kind of ramp adoption there? And then in growing the institutional bond trading activity, do we see most of that early upside stemming from this ETF hub or is there some extra white space out there that some of our larger competitors maybe falling short on? Benjamin R. Jackson - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Great question. Thank you, Jeremy. So, remember, when we announced this initiative on the ETF hub, we didn't do it in isolation. We were actually brought into it from one of the leading issuers in BlackRock. And really got the product off the ground and thinking about the requirements of what's going to need to be built. A lot of it's leveraging expertise that they have to \u2013 that they want to see us be successful in this market. The other thing that well positioned us to do this and made it unique for us to be their partner, and why I believe they came to us to do this, is the combination of the analytical assets, the data assets that we've mentioned several times, our instant messaging platform that we have to handle the unique negotiations that happen in that create-redeem process, our ETF and index expertise and our execution capabilities, and willingness as a newcomer to the space to really help build an open architecture industry utility that would be embraced by the industry. And as we have gone out this past quarter with BlackRock to meet with all of the other main issuers, the other authorized participants that are in this marketplace, the banks and market-makers, the response has been overwhelmingly positive. We formed the advisory committee that's going to be guiding the requirements, and we're finalizing that as we speak. And as we finalize that, we're going to be finalizing our launch plan in 2019. So in sum, we're filling a void where nobody is really acting in a market that's growing at a 30% compounded annual growth rate. But underpinning it, it has no standards, no consistency of process, disconnected systems, prone to error. And really needs someone to step in and fill that void. Operator : The next question will come from Ben Herbert of Citi. Please go ahead. Ben Herbert - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a follow-up, Scott, to Mike's question on just a more constructive volume backdrop if that persists kind of into 2019. Just are there any perhaps areas you might be looking to ramp up investment against that? Thanks. Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yeah, look, I think as you're starting to think about 2019 expense, yeah, I'd point you back to the last couple years and I don't think the framework looks a lot different. We've got $30 million of synergies that we've committed to go, we'll deliver that. Our employees have delivered another good year. We've historically had 3% to 4% merit and bonus increases. We'll do that. D&A has tended to tick up $20 million a year or so as we roll through our CapEx spend and build out our IDC \u2013 or our ICE Data Services, data center plan and roll out Pillar. And then we've identified certain specific investments we've made in support of current revenue and future revenue. And I think that framework holds as we move into 2019. We'll obviously give you more specifics as we move into the February call. But I wouldn't go into 2019 looking for expense to really look that different than it did coming into 2017 and then moving into 2018. We did note coming into 2018 that we were going to reinvest some of the tax savings, which we're doing. And so I wouldn't expect the investment level necessarily to be at a similar level. But the other dynamic I think are pretty consistent and will remain. Directly to your question, none of that is driven by trading volumes. And so to the extent that that continues to trend as it has and certainly open interest is an indicator that it will, but volatility is a key metric that will determine the extent, that that requires no additional expense and will expand margins and does drop to the bottom line and will inform our decisions with regards to our capital return plans with shareholders. So overall expense for 2019, the model's going to look very similar directly to Trading & Clearing revenue. That growth is built on open interest and requires very little incremental spend. Operator : The next question will come from Kyle Voigt of KBW. Please go ahead. Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to ask a question on the regulatory environment and really relate it to the third-country CCP amendments by the European Commission that were proposed last year. I think, Chairman [Christopher] Giancarlo has been a lot more vocal about the potential impacts of those on U.S. clearing houses and has kind of threatened to respond to that EU proposal. Just wondering how you're thinking about potential risk to your business from all this jockeying between the EU, UK and U.S., given that you're kind of uniquely positioned in all the jurisdictions involved. And what you think the likely resolution will be moving forward. Thanks. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Thank you. That's a good question, one that spends a pretty significant amount of time and has for the last couple years with the management team here. Really the way we're thinking about it is, is a bit like the way you framed your question, which is, we don't exactly know how it's going to end up. So we feel like, and have for years felt like, we need to have assets in various jurisdictions. And we need to hone our technology and our skills and our capabilities so that we could theoretically move and follow markets if they move between those jurisdictions. And we have a large presence in the UK, as you may know. And the UK may become a third country to the EU, in which case there'll be some kind of third country CCP regime. It may have some kind of interim fix for how that's going to work. It may not, in which case the U.S. may have a third-country CCP regime into Europe. Obviously, businesses in Europe will be able to access Europe. But then the question is, can outsiders that are not in Europe access European CCP. So all of that is in the mix right now. I think recent conversation coming out of Europe and the UK is that there's a recognition that a hard Brexit that failed to deal with an interim solution would be bad for all the people involved. And so we've seen a lot of constructive conversation in the background about how to overcome these things, working within current law and the negotiations that are going on between the various parties. Long story short, I think Europe has basically said, we want to oversee our financial services infrastructure. And the U.S. has said, we want to oversee our financial services infrastructure. Those are rational positions that each government has taken. And so they're going to have to find the gray area in the middle on how they work together for the international players that are in both places. But honestly, I do see that happening notwithstanding the rhetoric. There's an appreciation that many markets are global and that everybody's going to need access in order to hedge risks. And that's in the best interest of local economies. So I'm sitting here being honestly more optimistic than I have been for the last few years. Operator : The next question will come from Vincent Hung of Autonomous. Please go ahead. Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP : Hi. So it seemed like at the roundtable, there's a lot of maybe some consensus around making enhancements to the SIP through the additions of flood data, (53:54) speed improvements and also perhaps opening up the SIP to competitors. So let's say, this happened. How much of a negative could that be for your SIP revenues? Or could there be offsets from charging for the prop data driving those feeds? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Well, it's hard to know how to answer that. But you may recall that when we bought the NYSE, we tried to put out a straw-man proposal that we hope the industry would adopt that maybe everybody uses the SIP and there is no prop feed. Or maybe we get rid of the SIP and everybody uses prop feeds or so on and so forth. So we have long had the mindset that change in that area will not hurt us. It may benefit us and certainly get rid of some of the rhetoric. I've been amazed to see in the press there's still a perception that there's somehow a two-tier market of speed and access that I don't believe even exists any longer. We go to extraordinary lengths to look at delivering messages equally to all participants including SIP and as do most of our peers so that there is no distinction. And of course, the markets should continue to invest in the SIP, the volumes, transaction volumes and changes going into the market would suggest that we need constant upgrade. And the total spend to operate the SIP is in the scheme of things, quite tiny. So it's \u2013 I don't think there's going to be a large debate over whether there should be continued investment. But the debate seems to be about who should sit in the room and who should get a vote and who should be the vendor and it's all small ball issues that in the scheme of things probably don't impact anybody in the market as long as we can all agree to continue to make it better. Operator : The next question will come from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks, guys. Jeff, appreciate all your comments on equity market structure this morning. I know in the past you've tried reaching a grand bargain with the banks on an unrelated matter. Unfortunately, that was unsuccessful. But with respect to these market data challenges, is there an opportunity, do you think, for the industry to come together and perhaps make a compromise on the fees? Or do you think at this point the two sides are just too far apart? Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: It's a great question. We proffered as part of the access fee pilot that why don't we freeze data revenues and why don't we come up with a better pilot that doesn't negatively impact listed companies but gets to the heart of where the argument by the large players which are the large banks by the large data providers and by the exchanges? Really this is a Range Rover versus BMW versus Mercedes argument. And we propose that the fee freeze on the industry for data. The interesting thing is that a lot of people now as a result of the SEC's actions think, oh, that's not a good deal. Maybe fees should go down. And even though it looked to us like the SEC went to great pains to suggest that they're not saying that fees should go higher or fees should go lower as part of their action, they didn't make any qualitative statement like that. What I think the market has missed and what I think may be realized over time in this debate is that these hundreds of filings that were made were not hundreds of fee increases. These are filings made over a decade. When we went from largely analog to digital and when we went from a market where there was no such thing as an ETF to a robust market of ETFs. When there was no such thing as a smart order router to everyone using smart order routers, when there was no such thing as a Robo-advisor to a massive uses of Robo-advisors. All of those things are different products and services and changes and bundles. And in many cases, they're fee decreases or getting rid of products and so on and so forth. So it's a big mixed bag of filings that are in there. The way those filings work, the way we've seen them work since ICE has owned the New York Stock Exchange is that there's not a big rubberstamp inside the SEC. We put filings in, in draft form and have a lot of conversation with staff around many of these filings. And staff often says we think the price is too high, or we don't like the bundle, or we don't like the way it's worded, or we don't like the access provisions and so on and so forth. And there's a large negotiation that goes on, on many of these with staff, and in many cases these filings are withdrawn, and they go away, or in many cases they're modified and they go forward. And what has happened I believe as a result of this order, the SEC has now said when you do a filing, if you're an exchange, show up with an army. Show up with an army of consultants, of economists and lawyers. And of course, from now on we're going to show up with an army of litigators. And I don't know if you guys have ever \u2013 that have been listening to me have ever been in a situation where you have a bunch of litigators that are advising you and so the quiet conversation of drafting and going back and forth with staff is going to be a very different dynamic from here forward because everything's going to be documented and footnoted and written down. And I'm not sure that prices go down in that situation. It may well be that exchanges that wanted to raise prices in the past, and had staff interfaced that said that that wasn't a good idea. That may be gone in this new environment at least for the next few years. And so I'm not convinced that this is some massive downward pressure on fees. It may actually have taken the downward pressure on fees away. And when the industry \u2013 if I'm right in that and the industry realizes that, I think there is a good environment for a negotiation. But right now, it feels like a lot of the big players think, oh, I'm going to use my lobbying effort at the SEC to reduce my prices, and I'm not convinced that that's what's going to happen as part of this policy. Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Yeah. I think an important point not to lose sight of too is, Jeff keeps talking about the overall quality of the markets, the participation in the markets, the cost to trade in the market. And that's more than just data. It's data, it's trading, it's all of the pieces. And so, again it's why I go back, if you look at half our data business is pricing and analytics and the revenue model we delivered, new products, new customers, existing customers. It all drives pricing and analytic 100%. For exchange data connectivity, the other half of that data revenue, it works intricately with the trading side of it. And really whether it's fewer session fees, but higher trading share or a little less on the data side, and a little more on the trading side, every one of those is a revenue dollar we'll take. And that's why I wouldn't get too hung up on which bucket it falls into. It's our revenues growing overall, it's earnings growing overall and are we providing better markets to our customers? Operator : And this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Sprecher for any closing remarks. Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.: Thank you, Carrie, and thank you all for joining us today. We'll be speaking with you again in February when we'll report our results for the fourth quarter. And I hope you all have a great day, a happy and safe Halloween, and we look forward to talking to you soon. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Warren Gardiner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Warren Gardiner : Good morning. ICE's fourth quarter 2018 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the theice.com. These items will be archived, and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements which we undertake no obligation to update represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2018 Form 10-K, which we filed this morning. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures including adjusted income, EPS, operating income, operating margin, expenses, effective tax rate, organic data revenue, free cash flow and EBITDA. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more effective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP terms in the earnings materials and explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful; as well as how management uses these measures in our Form 10-K. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction based expenses, and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain items. Also, with us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Ben Jackson, our President. I'll now turn the call over to Scott. Scott Hill : Thanks, Warren. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our record fourth quarter performance. ICE's consolidated fourth quarter net revenues increased 14% year-over-year to a record $1.3 billion. Trading and clearing net revenues were a record $657 million and data and listings revenues totaled a record $651 million underpinned by organic constant currency growth of 6%. Adjusted operating expenses totaled $553 million in the quarter. Our fourth quarter expenses included a $5 million increase in our performance-related compensation reflecting the strong end to a good year. In addition, the quarter included around $3 million related to organizational restructuring and a few million dollars of non-recurring items. These items weren't contemplated in our original guidance and aren't expected to be recurring. Continuing with our fourth quarter highlights, adjusted operating income grew 14% year-over-year and we delivered record adjusted earnings per share of $0.94, a 25% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2017. Importantly, that strong earnings growth combined with reduced CapEx spend generated record free cash flow of $2.3 billion, up 32% versus the prior year. I'll discuss the way we put that cash to work on slide 5. During the fourth quarter, we deployed the remaining $140 million of our 2018 $1.2 billion repurchase authorization. When combined with the $555 million in dividends we paid, the capital return to shareholders during 2018 totaled nearly $1.8 billion. That record capital return is 23% higher than last year and nearly double what we returned just a few years ago. We did all of this while maintaining our target leverage and investing over $1 billion in strategic initiatives including fixed income, mortgages and along with our partners the launch of Bakkt. The strong cash generation of our business model will continue to support our disciplined approach to investment and capital return once again in 2019. As we've indicated in the past, we're committed to growing our dividend as the company grows. Reflecting that commitment, our board authorized a 15% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.275 per share. And as we noted on our third quarter call, our board has approved a $2 billion share repurchase authorization from which we've already deployed around $115 million in January. Now, let's move to slide 6 where I'll provide an overview of the fourth quarter performance of our trading and clearing business. Trading and clearing revenue which increased 14% for the full year grew to $657 million in the fourth quarter with both energy and ag revenue up 13% and financials revenue up 28%. Fourth quarter ADV and our futures business increased 21% year-over-year as energy, ag, rate and equity index products all increased versus the prior year. While January volumes across our Futures & Option complex are down year-over-year, they're up sequentially versus an unusually strong December. And importantly, open interest continues to build with OI at the end of January 4% higher than a year ago led by continued strength in oil and interest-rate products. At the NYSE, transaction revenues increased 35% year-over-year driven by higher industry volumes and market share gains across cash equity and options as well as the acquisition of CHX. ADV in our cash equity's business increased 45% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and average daily volume in our options business was up 44%. This momentum carried into January with cash equity volumes up 19% year-over-year. Moving to fixed income and credit, which includes CDS clearing, our fixed income trading businesses and ICE Mortgage Services revenue totaled $83 million for the quarter. CDS clearing revenue increased 25% year-over-year and is growing at a compound growth rate of 15% since 2012. New participants, new products and the need for additional credit protection remain catalyst for that business. Turning next to slide 7, I'll discuss the data and listings segment. Fourth quarter data services revenue grew 6% on an organic constant currency basis to a record $539 million. For the full-year, data services revenues grew 5% on an organic constant currency basis including 6% growth in products included in our ASV, which account for roughly 90% of our data services business. Within data services during the fourth quarter, revenue from an exchange data and feeds grew 7% and desktops and connectivity grew 1% each on an organic constant currency basis. Please note that beginning with the fourth quarter, we have moved our feeds business out of desktops and connectivity and into exchange data. This better distinguishes the exchange related content we sell from our distribution capabilities and it provides a better comparison to our data services peers. We've provided a restatement of historical data services results to reflect this change in the Appendix. Revenues from pricing and analytics, which represent half of our data revenues and nearly quarter 1/4 of our total revenues, were up 7% on an organic constant currency basis for the third consecutive quarter. As you can see on the slide, our pricing and analytics revenue growth has accelerated from nearly 4.5% in 2016 to more than 5% in 2017 and now to over 6.5% in 2018. This accelerating growth reflects contributions from every component of our revenue model, new customers, new products, increased consumption from existing customers, and targeted price increases. And importantly ASV for pricing and analytics entering 2019 is up 7%, giving us confidence and continued momentum. Finally, in our listings business, revenues grew 8% in the fourth quarter and the NYSE listed 16 IPOs despite heightened market volatility. And for the year, we were once again the leading U.S. exchange in terms of capital formation, helping our customers raise $30 billion in IPO proceeds. I'll conclude my remarks on slide 8. On the left-hand side of the slide, you can see a recap of our strong 2018 performance. Revenues grew 7%, adjusted operating income grew 8%, adjusted earnings per share grew 21%, and free cash flow grew 32%. On the right-hand side of the slide, you'll note a few points of guidance for 2019. We expect full year data services revenues to be between $2.19 billion and $2.24 billion. This includes $540 million to $545 million in the first quarter with sequential improvement each quarter thereafter. This also reflects the impact of a stronger dollar versus both the euro and pound, which is currently expected to reduce 2019 data revenues by roughly $5 million to $10 million. And of note with no material data acquisitions in 2018, currency fluctuation is the only adjustment that should be required to calculate our 2019 data revenue growth. Moving next to expenses. We anticipate full year adjusted operating expense to be between $2.15 billion and $2.2 billion. 2018 acquisitions in our trading and clearing segment will generate roughly $35 million to $40 million in incremental expense, net of around $15 million in actions already taken to reduce the costs of those acquired businesses. In addition to the cost savings, the expense will be more than offset by over $100 million of incremental revenue. On top of the cost savings for the recently acquired businesses, we will deliver the final $30 million of synergies related to IDC, which means we will have achieved our original commitment of $180 million in total synergies. Next, consistent with past years, we will once again reward our employees for their strong contribution as a part of our pay-for-performance philosophy, which will increase compensation expense by $35 million to $40 million. Investments in technology as well as expenses tied to revenue growth will add around $30 million to $35 million. And finally, our investment in Bakkt will generate $20 million to $25 million of expense based upon the run rate in the first quarter. We will update you on progress at Bakkt and the level of investment as we move through the year. We delivered another record year in 2018 and we have momentum entering 2019. I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now I'll hand it to Jeff to expand on our strategic plans entering the new year. Jeff Sprecher : Thank you, Scott, and good morning to everyone on the call. Let me begin on slide 9. We're pleased to report what was the best year in ICE's history and that marks our 13th consecutive year of record revenues and record adjusted earnings per share. Our track record of growth is a testament to the strategic approach that we've taken since our inception to build a globally diverse platform that enhances our customers' workflows using technology to bring efficiency, transparency and reliability to markets. In our futures markets, we're strategically positioned in major market centers around the world with six simple clearing houses across North America, the U.K., Europe and Asia. It's a footprint that gives our customers choice, helps insulate us from regulatory and political risk and provides a platform for product development that enables us to swiftly capitalize on growth opportunities as they emerge around the world. Our exchanges and clearing houses operate on common technology, providing our markets with the flexibility to move jurisdictions if desired often as quickly as over a weekend. These markets run on proprietary technology, designed to meet the comprehensive workflow needs of a wide range of market participants. On top of this technology and our global distribution are the critical benchmark contracts that traders investors and commercial participants rely upon to manage their every day risks. In our oil markets, Brent crude is the global benchmark for nearly two-thirds of the internationally traded oil that moves around the world each day. Once again, Brent generated record revenues in 2018 and it remains a cornerstone of our energy product development as well as for customer acquisition and retention in our energy business. Brent's relevance to our oil complex is complimented by our Gasoil contract. Gasoil's been one of the fastest-growing energy benchmarks with open interest up 11% per annum on average over the last five years. Gasoil has become a key benchmark for the refined barrel including diesel and jet fuel. And the upcoming IMO marine fuel regulations which are set to take hold in 2020 could provide additional risk-management tailwinds to our oil complex. In our natural gas markets, we offer a suite of liquid, global benchmarks, a platform that is unmatched in the marketplace. In fact, roughly two-thirds of our natural gas revenue is now derived from products other than the U.S. Henry Hub, a benchmark that is losing relevance to commercial customers as other global benchmarks grow. As natural gas globalizes, our customers' participation in these markets have accelerated with open interest across our 58 North American natural gas spaces markets, up 17% year-over-year, our European TTF natural gas contract with open interest at near-record levels, up 64% year-over-year and with our JKM contract which is the benchmark for Asian natural gas achieving record trading volumes in January. We see a similar dynamic in our financial futures business which includes European interest rates and equity indices. Brexit uncertainty and the shifting expectations around global economic growth, continue to drive increased hedging activities with interest-rate average daily volumes increasing 14% year-over-year and open interest up 8% through the end of January. And our alternative interest-rate complex is also benefiting from increased adoption with over $1.6 trillion of notional cleared in our SONIA products since its launch just over a year ago. In our equities futures business, average daily volume in our MSCI index has grown at a CAGR of 34% since 2014, and was up 40% in January. In particular, as trade tensions in the U.S. and China continue to build, so too is open interest in the MSCI emerging market index. As of the end of January, open interest stood at 1.4 million contracts. And for comparison purposes, this represents over 20% of the total notional outstanding in the S&P 500 E-mini contract an amount which was less than 5% only five years ago. In addition to our futures markets we're continuously working to bring efficiencies, transparency and reliability to the U.S. cash equities markets. At the NYSE, we've been rolling out our pillar technology, a technology that has the capacity to handle 80 billion messages a day and which should improve the customer execution and access experience to our seven distinct equities trading venues. When combined with our hybrid designated market maker model, we provide customers with a differentiated platform that reduces volatility, provides tighter bid offer spreads and offers an all-in cost to trade that is significantly lower than the average dark pool or dark venue like the IEX exchange. Our model of compensating designated market-makers to protect and manage stocks is a unique value proposition that shines brightest amidst market volatility such as we've seen in December as the average quoted spreads on NYSE listed and traded stocks were approximately 100 -- excuse me 180 basis points tighter and volatility was over 50% lower on the open and 60% lower on the close than our closest listing competitor. And finally in our data services business, we continue to build on our unique platform as the leading provider of mission-critical derived data and analytics. The results of these efforts are best illustrated by the performance in our pricing and analytics business which grew nearly 7% in 2018. Demand for our pricing and reference data analytics and indices is accelerating. Active managers continue to search for better tools and data to drive output as there's a shift towards passive investing which continues. These two trends have provided a tailwind to our business in particular to our index business. At the end of January following the transition of the iShares preferred stock ETF, ICE had $175 billion of fixed income ETF assets tracking our indices, a whopping 80% increase from just a year ago. Turning to slide 10 as I noted at the beginning of my prepared remarks, 2018 was yet another record year for ICE. A strong topline contribution from our transaction business was complemented by compounding growth in our data and listings business. Coupled with strong expense management and our synergy execution, we produced double-digit EPS growth, reinforcing our conviction that we have in our long-term strategy. And as we look to 2019 and beyond we're excited about the opportunities that lie ahead, not only for our core business but also for newer initiatives such as ICE Mortgage Services, our fixed-income businesses and Bakkt which recently raised over $180 million in its first round of funding. I'd like to conclude by thanking our customers for their business and for their trust in 2018 and I want to thank my colleagues for their efforts that contributed to yet another very strong year for ICE. I'll now turn the call back to our operator Kerry and she'll conduct the question-and-answer session until 9 :30 Eastern Time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Rich Repetto : Hi. Good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Scott. I guess, my question's going to be a broad question on some of the external sort of forces you're bumping into both in Europe and the U.S. And I guess, in Europe when you look at Brexit, Jeff, you mentioned some of the benefits that people are needing to hedge more, but could you overall give us a recap of where do you think you stand on Brexit? There's this issue of I know the tax on commodities potentially being forced by the EU. And then in the U.S., the external forces where these ideas of compete -- new competing exchange as well as the scrutiny on data, do you think that that -- we can move on beyond that? Or what points would you highlight to investors in those areas? Jeff Sprecher : Well, welcome to my world, Rich. You basically asked me to describe my job. So let's start with Brexit. First of all, as you've mentioned, unfortunately, we benefit from Brexit because the volatility that government actions impose on companies force them to manage their risk and we're in the risk management business. So there's really an overarching positive impact on our revenues and income. That said, as you know we've long felt that we shouldn't consolidate all our businesses geographically. And we have a trading and clearing operation in the U.K. and we also have a trading and clearing operation in the EU. And we put both of them on common technologies, so that we have to move \"business\" around. It's really just a database move inside of our company and not a physical move. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that's something we can do over a weekend. That said, there's a lot of political back and forth going on including now revisiting tax issues. On the tax issues specifically, this has been going on for over a decade. It's remanded to the courts now, the EU courts. In 21 months or so, the U.K. theoretically is no longer bound by the EU courts. So I don't know that it's going -- and this is going to have any practical impact other than another negotiating ploy that's going on over a complicated relationship between the U.K. and the EU as it relates to Brexit. It's something that we -- everybody and our whole industry has lived with forever, but ICE has always maintained the optionality to move contracts and to locate business where our customers want to be. And if certain things would have to move or be relocated in order to map and minimize the impact of that we certainly would do that. We'll take our cue from the industry. With respect to the U.S. and the members exchange, let me just set the table if I could, because for some reason there seems to be an incredible amount of concern about this press release. You have to go back to a decade or so when we've had the automation of trading particularly in the equities world. We had the Flash Boys book in the \"Flash Boys phenomenon\". And as a result of that we saw the SEC a couple of years ago order the exchanges to do what they called a tick pilot, which was essentially widen out or narrow the spreads of certain stocks to see how they would trade. And really what that is doing is affecting the behavior of the high-frequency traders that make their income by trying to capture the bid offer spread. That pilot has finished and the data's being analyzed and you next see the SEC trying to promulgate something called a fee pilot. It's not that well named in my mind, because it actually doesn't impact the fees or the capture rate of the exchanges, but it changes theoretically over a number of different buckets the amount of rebate that can be paid to high-frequency market-making firms and brokers. There are a lot of people in our industry that are looking at the retail equity market and saying the next leg of that stool. If one follows the SEC's actions maybe to investigate and change the way retail payment for order flow operates. And Rich, I think you know that, retail order flow that comes through retail brokers is largely sold directly to high-frequency market-makers. It never goes to exchanges. And what we saw is a group of high-frequency market-makers that participate in the retail space organized up all of the retail brokers that they pay these fees to and try to quickly move to set up an exchange that we believe is to try to get in front of what may be the trend of eliminating and changing their business model. Now for us at the New York Stock Exchange, unfortunately, we don't see any of that retail order flow. We don't believe that that the behavior impacts us at all. In fact to the extent that those orders are not executed on after they're sold to the market-makers the exhaust which are basically people consider to be toxic because these are bids and offers that are off-market are routed to an exchange that is not us. So we have very little impact with what's going on over there. That said, we believe that \u2013 we support what they're doing and we'll not fight to what they're doing, because we think it has still over benefits to the New York Stock Exchange. First of all, we don't compete for any retail order flow. And if the idea is that they're no longer going to be able to sell order flow directly to market-makers and it's going to have to be public competition to the retail consumers for the best bid offer we would like to compete for that. And if there's going to be a new exchange they think, they can compete for. We believe we could compete for. We have amongst the lowest cost of trading all-in cost of trading anywhere cheaper than dark pools, cheaper than the newer exchanges that have formed up. And we believe that the new exchange is going to have to cover its cost. For us this workflow will be incremental and we believe we could offer low-cost trading that would be accretive to ICE shareholders and very, very competitive to the end user for the bid offer. Secondly, a new exchange is going to continue to fragment order flow. Even if there are even if there's no business there bids and offers that are sent there are going to have to be viewed. That's going to increase the capacity, the network capacity needed to manage that. That means, the data spend wallet of end users is going to go up not down. And we run networks and we can compete to provide that increased capacity. That's in fact a big part of the growth of this business. So we see the wallet going up. And lastly, one of the techniques that the SEC uses to promulgate, these changes is to essentially order the exchanges to adopt rules instead of going through a large public rule-making where \u2013 which takes a long time and have a lot of comments and difficulty getting through. Oftentimes the SEC will just order the exchanges to adopt the rule given that we have rule making capability. So this is the case for example in a consolidated audit trail. The exchanges were ordered to build a consolidated audit trail by filing individual rules at each exchange that would allow that to happen. There's a lot of complaints in the market over who got the vote on that, consolidated audit trail for example. People that were not exchanges, didn't get a vote. Now we know the reason that the buy side and the sell side would like to have a vote is they want to make sure that they don't have to pay for it or that they can at least cap the costs. In the consolidated audit trail case, there is no budget. It is an unlimited spend. It is one of the most technically difficult projects that has ever been attempted in our industry managing billions and billions of data point that have consumer information, that can be captured time stamped on an atomic clock and can be readily searchable for trends is a daunting challenge. And it has been a huge spend on behalf of the exchanges. So we would welcome others to come in and help to fray those costs and have a vote in that matter because they also would be pregnant with the obligations of that matter. The recent exchanges have been fighting people having votes is that they don't have the underlying obligation. So long story short, we see that we may have an opportunity to compete for retail order flow. We believe there's going to be an increase data wallet spend and we believe that this could finally align interest in the industry. And so in that regard, I don't see why in any event anyone should consider it a negative impact on our company. I think it will ultimately accrue positive. Thank you for listening to that one-winded answer but that is my role. Operator : The next question will come from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning. On the data side, your ASV is up 6%. Your revenue guide for 2019 is up 3.5% to a little under 6%. Can you help us bridge the gap between the two? Clearly, FX is a part, but I think some of the inflation Scott gave show that it was really a small part. So what are the other factors in the gap between ASV and the data revenue guide? And is BAML -- where is BAML in these figures now on the organic side? And where is it not? Scott Hill : So, Ken first of all the guidance range we gave constant currency is roughly 4% to 6% year-over-year, so just to take any concerns or questions out regarding what a constant currency guide is in those dollar terms. If you think about ASV at 6%, if you remember that's 90% of our revenue. As I said in my prepared remarks, in 2018 our overall data business grew 5%. Our ASV revenue grew 6%. And so the elements that aren't inside ASV things like NMS, session fees et cetera haven't been and we don't expect will become big growth drivers in the overall business. So I actually think, if you take the absolute value ASV and you consider it as 90% of our revenue, it gives you -- it pushes you right into the middle of our range. So I feel like we're set up very well to deliver another year of solid growth in the data business. The mix of that's going to look a little different. The Pricing & Analytics business as I mentioned is moved up from 4.5% to over 5% to 6.5% and I think it's headed to 7% this year. Connectivity on the other side capacity growth has been tremendous over the last couple of years. I think that will likely slow a little bit this year as customers consume that capacity. But again you're seeing that content coming through the additional capacity in Pricing and Analytics grow. But connectivity itself is likely to be closer to a 1% to 2% growth. And then exchange data is going to be in the middle of those two with our futures and exchange data continuing to be in strong demand, some additional value capture from oil products that we were able to add to our energy packages. And so overall I feel like 2019 sets up to be a very good year and I actually think the ASV aligns perfectly with what the guidance suggests. Operator : The next question will come from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning One more question on the data. Just looking back at your -- the pie chart from the investor data broke down the mid to high-single-digit growth and the components of that. Can you talk about the breakdown between pricing new customers incremental consumption kind of those -- the various buckets that you would outline and how that fits today as you look at 2019 where we're looking pretty much squarely like a mid-single-digit number versus that mid to high? Scott Hill : Yeah, thanks for the question. So the interesting thing about that model is there are parts of the business where as you look at 2019 expectation it fits perfectly. There's a very good balance in the Pricing and Analytics business, which I just said I think is going to go around 7% for the year. New products, your reference data products, indices -- by the way Ken the answer to your question is the Bank of America Merrill Lynch indices are fully organic this year. Everything is, because there weren't data acquisitions last year. So all our growth in 2019 will be organic. But we've got new products that are driving growth, new customers; the MiFID II introduced us to a lot of small and medium-sized European customers who are now buying the breadth of our products not just things like the liquidity indicator that solved an existing need. Existing customers buying more of those MiFID II products that really drove great growth in Europe that you'll look at the back of the slide and see that our mix to Europe has actually moved back to 20% where it was 21%, 22%, back when we had trade dipped below 20% now it's back. Those new customers buying more but then those new products existing customers in the U.S. are buying, because they need liquidity indicators and best execution indicators. And so that's driving growth. And then again we are seeing a contribution from price. I'll note one thing in that model if you pull it out; it included roughly a point of growth from M&A. And we don't have that this year. If you look back over the last couple of years and exclude the businesses we divested our inorganic growth if you will was close to 7%. So I look at 2019 as a year where we're going to deliver very solid growth with the 10% element that relates to M&A not present at all and then a very strong balance across pricing, across new customers, across new products et cetera in a fairly even contribution again inside Pricing and Analytics. If you look at exchange data that really is our existing customers buying more on the future side, and growth in the number of customers consuming those products. And on the connectivity side, even though I think it will slow versus where it was, we continue to see capacity growth, which again is existing customers buying more with in fact an actual price reduction there because as they buy the larger ports, the actual price per gig comes down a little bit. So it mixes across the elements, but I think that revenue model is still very indicative other than again in 2019, we don't have the point contribution from M&A. Operator : The next question will come from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Blostein : Hey guys, good morning. Just a question around the -- I guess just thinking of the business. So maybe get an update on initiatives you guys have lined up for 2019 and credit trading on the back of the platforms that you purchased. I think on the last call maybe the call before that you talked about that being call it $100-ish million kind of trading annual run rate. Where does that stand today? And what are some things you guys are working on to get that going higher? Jeff Sprecher : Let me have Ben Jackson answer that for you. Ben Jackson : Thanks Alex. So our platforms had a very strong Q4 when you look at TMC and BondPoint. As a lot of you know, volatility came back to U.S. corporates and munis in the fourth quarter and we were a beneficiary of that where volume on BondPoint and TMC was up over 9% over the prior quarter and 20% over the prior year. And in notional terms, what was traded we were up 12% over the prior quarter and 50% over the prior year. And note that I was highlighting there that notional is greater than volume which means the average trade size is also increasing on the platform. So one of the things I've talked about on prior calls is that OddBot trading, so trades of north of 100 bonds per trade has continued to increase. And last year, we saw a BondPoint, a 50% increase on an annual basis of OddBot trading and 23% increase on TMC. The other thing I'd highlight is you've got to remember we've owned these platforms for a short period of time. So BondPoint, we've had for about a year; TMC about six months. And our integration effort is well underway. Just in the last few weeks, we've combined our business and technology teams across TMC, BondPoint, Creditex into one team, now called ICE bonds. And we're executing with a single-mission, direction, leveraging technology across the group for efficiencies and scales. So we're starting to realize some of what I have mentioned on prior calls is getting the operating income of those businesses in line with where we see our other trading businesses. The only thing I'd say is, you've got to take a step back because buying those businesses wasn't about just fixed-income execution and isolation, it's really about providing our customers a complete integrated comprehensive solution to real challenges that there are in fixed income. When you combine real-time and end-of-day pricing, we're the market leader, providing for three million instruments around the world, not only end-of-day prices, but real-time prices. With our reference data business where we're providing reference data, the golden record of the terms and conditions for bonds for 13 million instruments, a leader in that space. We have index expertise and fixed income that came onboard with the ICE Bank of America Merrill Lynch index business that's growing fast as mentioned in the commentary. We also have analytics leadership in the fixed-income space where customers trust us with $1 trillion in assets to run through our analytical platforms, to understand the return attribution, to identify the next optimal trade opportunity, to identify liquidity risks that they have in their portfolio et cetera. And last but not least, you add onto that the choice of execution protocols that we have from central order book and streaming protocols that's core to the businesses that we bought and that's the most difficult protocols to establish. When you have to manage 100 million price updates a day on BondPoint, 77 million price updates on TMC, you have securities that you can provide customers that on 10000 securities you can provide markets that have 250 bonds up on the best bid and best offer at any given point in time. We have 23000 securities with two-way markets. You have to manage best execution, manage connectivity, manage latency, all these are real challenges in building out those streaming protocols and we have that well established in our business. In addition I've highlighted that we're building out our cue and auction capabilities that already represents 20% of the volume on those platforms and will be instrumental as well when the ETF hub project comes to life later this year that I've also talked to this group about. And the ETF hub project gives us an opportunity to be at one of the hottest and highest growth area in the fixed-income space which is passive investing which has had a 30% CAGR over the last 10 years. That gives you a little bit of a flavor of the initiatives that we have coming down the pipe. Operator : The next question will come from Michael Carrier of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Carrier : Thanks, good morning. Scott just on the on some of the guidance on the expenses just in terms of - like some of the buckets that you gave just anywhere like $30 million, $35 million on tech investment for new growth and then the $20 million, $25 million on Bakkt just wanted to get your sense on like what are those maybe initiatives? What are the expected returns or like revenue growth associated with some of those expenses whether it's a 2019 or further out? Scott Hill : Yes. So it's a good question. And hopefully you found the guidance pretty consistent with what we've done in prior years. And as I look at kind of the average expectation, I think they're -- in terms of 2019 expense, I think they're pretty consistent as well with two adjustments. And I think right now you guys on average are expecting us to be around 21.60, 55 or 60. We told you that we went to work on the businesses we acquired last year and I've already taken out $15 million of costs there which if you would just use the run rate would be new news. And then additionally as you point out, we did note that we would be investing based on our first quarter run rate $20 million to $25 million. And I said we'd keep you updated on that as we move through the year. Specifically with regards to the revenue and the technology investments, I think those will continue to support revenue growth that likely overall is going to be in kind of that mid-single-digit range in total. That's all subject to volatility. But I definitely think those investments just as they did in 2017 and 2018 will support continued revenue growth. I think Bakkt is really an investment and I'll hand it over to Jeff to talk a little bit about it. That's more about the future and revenue and market opportunities that we see in the future and less about 2019 topline. Jeff Sprecher : Yes. Bakkt is a unique structure for us and that we've actually set it up as a separate company with a separate name, its own management team and separate capitalization. So right now ICE is the majority investor in the company, I expect that we'll do other rounds of financing. We'll make a decision as it goes forward whether we stay majority or allow it to spin three of us. We believe that what ICE has if you step back and look at us is, we have obviously trading clearing. We have settlement capabilities, warehouse and custody management capabilities, large treasury operations, banking connectivity and a global infrastructure that is in many, many jurisdictions -- regulatory distinctions around the world with a massive cyber overlay. That infrastructure has attracted a lot of very, very interesting companies that have come -- some that have invested in Bakkt, some are just working with Bakkt to try to tap into that infrastructure for some new use cases that will involve blockchain and digital assets and other things that we can provide these people. Obviously, we've announced the Starbucks -- our work with Starbucks and Microsoft. We have very, very large retail franchises global connectivity to end users that we hope will be brought into that ecosystem and could create a very, very valuable company out of that initiative if our business plan plays out. So it's a bit of a moonshot bet and it's been organized in a manner that is very different than the way ICE typically does businesses. Bakkt has its own offices, its own management team and et cetera. And then we've entered into agreements with it to provide services, as I've described over that Bakkt -- over that ICE overlay. So we'll see how it goes. They're well along in building out an infrastructure that I think you'll see launch later this year. And I'll let Bakkt talk more about how it wants to go about an what the business and use cases are its revenue model, et cetera, as it unfolds. Ben Jackson : Yes. And then the other only thing I'd add is in addition to separate teams, separate office it's separately funded. We and our partners have put cash aside to fund this business. And so while it won't generate revenue in the current year, it also doesn't impact our leverage that's already funded. It doesn't impact our capital returns. We increased the dividend 15%. We've already bought back over $115 million of shares in the quarter. And so it is funded in a sense, even though it's incremental expense on top of what you would have anticipated it is funded by cash that we and our partners have already put aside. Operator : The next question will come from Kyle Voigt of KBW. Please go ahead. Kyle Voigt : Hi. Good morning. Just one on M&A. Over the past few years, more of the M&A for ICE has been targeted on deals that are more bolt-on in nature. So I guess my questions really on the large-scale M&A and the exchange space. I think you've previously cited uncertainty around Brexit, uncertainty more broadly about the regulatory environment as an impediment to that occurring in the future along with the political environment, but it seems that we've gotten some clarity at least on the Brexit side for clearing, right? Can you give us an update on whether you still see the regulatory environment and this uncertainty more broadly as an impediment to large scale M&A in the sector? Thank you. Jeff Sprecher : I think your -- the sort of leading aspect to your question I think is correct is that things are clearing up from a regulatory standpoint, from a market structure standpoint. People have the large exchange groups have sort of stepped their footprints and it becomes more obvious where other acquisitions should flow in my mind. In our industry, we've seen obviously the formation of large exchange groups like ICE and our peers. We've also seen a consolidation in traders particularly high-frequency trading has consolidated and we've seen a consolidation in brokers. Order flow tends to go to a more limited number. The MiFID impact of providing analysis and analytics in your space has concentrated people. So we've been seeing a concentration across the entire financial services market that we serve. You could sort of date in there as well a number of large data companies formed up. So I do think that there will be continued M&A in our space and maybe more obvious as to where these large companies will touch one another. That said M&A for us have to be disciplined. We've done a lot of M&A that's been opportunistic. Large M&A has been opportunistic when it's been obvious that we should get together with somebody. That's set into our model that -- where we target returns above our cost of capital and make sure that these deals work with shareholders. And as you know we've been very disciplined on our synergy cases and we hold ourselves to high regard to deliver the synergies that we promised. And so M&A is not easy as companies get larger. But all that said, I do believe that some of the impediments are clearing. Ben Jackson : Yes. And just in the event -- you missed it on my first slide to validate Jeff's point on the financial discipline that we've executed on our past deals, our return on invested capital is now back to 9%. In total, it's 300 basis points above our cost of capital. And if you look at kind of outside IDC, it would've been back at 10%. And so when we say we're committed to doing deals that generate 10% returns, you see it in the results on our overall return on invested capital, which, again, as Jeff said, is that capital base has grown moving that made will continuously higher which we've done requires us to continue to grow profit which we've done. Operator : The next question will come from Ben Herbert of Citi. Please go ahead. Ben Herbert : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to go back to the data and particularly, Pricing and Analytics. Just within fixed income, how do you feel positioned to continue to accelerate growth there? I mean could we see more of that as you further integrate the ecosystem you've built? Or I know you gave the M&A guidance for 2019, but I mean is there an opportunity do you think to be a bit more acquisitive in the fixed-income side? Thanks. Ben Jackson : Hi, Ben, it's Ben. I think one of the place I'd start with is some of the commentary that I've mentioned before in that our strategy when we've looked at fixed income is we took a different approach to it than many others where we looked at what is the comprehensive solution that people need to solve the real issues in fixed income. Issues like how do I get a fair price? How do I figure out for someone that doesn't trade all that often, what is the price of that instrument? How do I keep on top of all of the vast ocean of reference data I need to understand in trading that? How do I find people that when I identify a trade I want to do? How do I find somebody that has inventory that indeed wants to trade? And then on the execution side being able to offer a number of different protocols for someone to execute. The thing I'd highlight that really pulled -- that I think is a good sign that we're heading down the right path year is that ETF hub project that I mentioned because it really -- in order to deliver that you have to have all those pieces and we're uniquely positioned to do that. And when you think about it, for the first time later this year when we launch the ETF hub, again, one of the hottest areas of growth in the fixed income market. For the first time if you're an authorized participant or a market maker and you want to create or redeem a share of an ETF, you're going to be able to, for the first time, connect to a single portal. And in that single portal, you'll be able to connect to multiple issuers as opposed to having 12 different interfaces that you're dealing with -- interface with these -- with the issuers. Second, you'll be able to gather the index constituents for each issuer's ETFs. So, think of all the hundreds of ETFs that they have, multiply it by the number of issuers that's all going to be able to be done in a single portal. Third, you'll be able to view that days basket constituents to be able to create or redeem a share. Every day those constituents change for each one of those funds and each one of those issuers. So you can see the problem compounds on itself as you think about it and the way that things are done today. Fourth, you'll be able to gather market data, data from us that we're the leading price provider in the space to be able to understand what are the trading levels of the constituents and the baskets that could be created or redeemed in that day. Next, you'll be able to negotiate, what is acceptable to submit through a create or redeem. In order to do that, you have to have instant-messaging capabilities which we have a well-established instant-messaging capabilities to be able to underpin this. And last, but not least, you'll be able to execute via our streaming protocols, our RFQ, our auctions as well as third-party venues to choose to connect through this portal. To me that's a pretty powerful sign of a place in the market that's growing very fast where market participants are pulling us into it because they see us uniquely positioned with the combination of assets that we have to solve this problem and to help the passive investing fixed-income space go to that next level of growth. Operator : The next question will come from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks very much. Just Scott, on the data revenue guidance, on the constant currency basis from 4% to 6%, what do you see as the biggest drivers between the difference of the 4% to 6%? Is it mostly in pricing or actually new customers? And then, if I could just ask one -- a couple of timing questions. Just on Ben, I think you said launching the RFQ and ETF hub later this year, when you think that might start contributing from a revenue perspective, if that's later this year or 2020. And then just one on timing of NYMEX development Jeff, thanks for your answer. Prior on that, do you think that is -- the members exchange is something that actually gets up in running and can begin to affect the markets later this year? Or is that more of a 2020 type of event? Scott Hill : Yes. So I'll start. I think there were three questions embedded in there. The 4% to 6% look I went into last year and I gave you guys a fairly tight data guidance and said we have good visibility into it, which I still believe is the case. But I think that got interpreted to something like 99.5% certainty in February. And so the range is a little wider this year just acknowledging what happened in 2018. There were some places where we had some erosion that we didn't expect on the downside in the desktop business some audits that we didn't anticipate in certain quarters as we move through the year. And so the reality is that all of those things worked out to a year where we grew the business 5%. And as I mentioned, ASV revenues actually grew 6%. But there were some churn that ran through the stock because the $2 million or $3 million difference in any given quarter and a $15 million or $20 million difference on $2 billion of revenue for the year. And so I thought it was prudent to try and take some of the volatility out around people who are trying to guess that $1 million on $500 million in the quarter. As I said on the call, I feel very confident that if you look at the ASV number that's going to point you right to the middle of our range. And then inside that, it's going to be driven by growth in Pricing & Analytics. So Ben's laid out a very compelling case for our overall fixed-income investment. But that's a bit -- that is effectively the IDC business that used to grow 2% to 3%. And I'm telling you it's going to grow two-and-a-half times faster than that just a few years later. And the ASV supports that and there's a lot of momentum in the products that we've got. So I feel very good about the business. I think the only thing you should interpret in the widening of the range is, just a little bit more, hey, yes, it could be plus or minus 1% versus plus or minus 0.5% last year. Ben Jackson : And, Brian, I'll pick up on the RFQ, ETF hub questions that you had. So on RFQ, we have that capability now. So in your question you said, is that going to be coming later this year? You have to remember, from being a long-time exchange, clearinghouse market operator in a number of different asset classes, we have expertise in the RFQ auction space in many of our markets. So we leverage a lot of that expertise and we're able to get those RFQ capabilities established on both BondPoint and TMC very rapidly. So that capability and functionality is there now. And now it's about leveraging our network and our distribution capabilities to get that out, which we're very well able to do as we have brought those businesses together with our Creditex business, that I've mentioned, and also leveraging all of the touch points we have in the fixed-income community through our ICE Data Services business. For the ETF hub, that will launch later this year. That's our targeted time frame with our steering committee. We have completed the requirements definition around that. We have the design well underway. We have most of the major issuers that are onboard, helping us with this, as well as the major APs and market-makers that are helping and assisting with that design. And that has enabled us to really lock that down and now we're looking at later this year. So you'll see contribution on this. We're targeting 2020. Jeff Sprecher : And lastly, on the members exchange. I guess, I'm not aware that there's management or anybody working on anything, but that's really not their obligation to discuss it with us. But that said, if I was in their position, if I wanted to get the market fast, I'd probably just copy verbatim somebody else's rule book. And probably there's a one year-ish process, one maybe two. Of course, if I copy somebody else's rule book, it doesn't give you anything that's unique that exists. And I would suspect that there's going to be a lot of scrutiny around the very issue that many pundits are talking about which is -- are the members going to try to bias their business towards the exchange, rather than seek the best price for their customers in the marketplace. And that come along way in the last few years in terms of disclosure and audit ability of that behavior. But it's not completely done yet. So I suspect there'll be a fair amount of conversation and review of just how is order flow intended to be routed. All that said, nothing moves fast in the regulatory world. And I can tell you that I'm watching Bakkt try to stand up its regulatory footprint. And things are not moving necessarily fast right now in the United States. Operator : The last question for today will come from Chris Allen of Compass Point. Please go ahead. Chris Allen : Good morning, guys. I think most of my questions have gone answered. I just had a quick numbers question. Just on the other revenues, which are boosted by $5 million in fines in 3Q, up sequentially again in 4Q. I'm just kind of wondering what's been driving that over the course of the year and kind of the outlook there? Scott Hill : So the other revenue Chris is where we've got the revenues associated actually with the interest we earned on our clearing house deposit. And so as the fed has moved rates up and the balances have grown and they tend to grow at year-end people like to part cash at our clearing houses at year-end. That's what drove it up. And so depending on what the rate environment is as we move through 2019, you could see a similar dynamic. If rates were constant, it will all correlate to the actual levels of collateral, cash collateral specifically that to some that's held at our clearing house. Nothing, more than that. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Sprecher for any closing remarks. Jeff Sprecher : Thank you, Kerry. Thank you all for joining us on the call and we look forward to really a guided up-year again for 2019, and we'll talk to you in the next quarter. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Warren Gardiner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Warren Gardiner : Good morning. ICE's first quarter 2019 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of theice.com. These items will be archived, and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements which we undertake no obligation to update represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2018 Form 10-K. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures including adjusted income, EPS, operating income, operating margin, expenses, effective tax rate, free cash flow and EBITDA. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP terms in the earnings materials and explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful; as well as how management uses these measures in our Form 10-Q. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction based expenses, and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain terms. Also, with us on the call are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Ben Jackson, our President. I'll now turn the call over to Scott. Scott Hill : Thanks, Warren. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4, with some of the key highlights from our first quarter performance. ICE's consolidated first quarter net revenues totaled $1.3 billion, up 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Trading and clearing net revenues grew 5% and data revenues increased 6%, each on a constant currency basis. This strong revenue performance help deliver the second best quarter of earnings per share and free cash flow in our company's history. First quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $528 million including, roughly $7 million non-recurring benefit and comp expense. Adjusted for that, we would have been at the low end of our guidance range at around $535 million. Second Quarter adjusted expenses are expected to increase to be between $537 million and $547 million largely driven by the full quarter impact of annual merit increases in equity grants. We then expect each subsequent quarter to increase sequentially by about $3 million to $5 million, reflecting increased technology investments and spend related to Bakkt. Incorporating all of those dynamics, we are now lowering our full year adjusted expense guidance to a range of $2.15 billion to $2.18 billion. I'll pause here to note that in the first quarter, we recognized $19 million of non-operating income related to a true up for OCC's 2018 results. Additionally, unlike last year, we did not receive a dividend from Euroclear in the first quarter. We do however expect a dividend of around $20 million in the fourth quarter, a 40% increase from the dividend received in the first quarter of 2018. Shifting to capital return, we deployed over 95% of our free cash flow to dividends that once again are increasing by double digits and share repurchases. Of note, the $440 million distributed via share buybacks in the first quarter included an additional $100 million, we opportunistically spent to repurchase shares at an average price of $75 during the month of March. The nearly $600 million in total capital that we returned during the first quarter has only been surpassed by the second quarter of last year, when we similarly deployed an additional $160 million to repurchase shares. We remain committed to strong capital returns, a dividend that grows as we do and opportunistic repurchases even as we continue to make key strategic growth investments. Now let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide additional color on the performance of our trading and clearing business. First quarter revenues were up 3% year-over-year or 5% on a constant currency basis. In our energy markets average daily volume was down 12% versus the prior year, as trading in the U.S. natural gas markets and the Henry Hub in particular suffered from lower levels of price volatility. Participation in the Brent and gas oil markets was negatively impacted by a combination of various geopolitical uncertainties and supply/demand dynamics. As you will note though, the volume declines were almost entirely offset by an 11% improvement in our average rate per contract. The improved RPC reflect strong volume growth in our European natural gas business, were ADV increased 42% in the quarter as well as our emissions business were volumes were up 35% that strong performance continued in April and more importantly, overall energy open interest continues to grow and is up 3% versus the end of 2018. In our financial futures market, while interstate volumes were impacted by Brexit and an uncertain European economic backdrop, MSCI volumes improve by 9% year-over-year. Importantly, while interest rate volume has been somewhat muted April to date, open interest continues to trend higher up 11% year-over-year as at the end of April. Moving to cash equities. Volumes increased 9% year-over-year in the first quarter and market share improved roughly 25%. Wrapping up with our fixed-income and credit business, revenues totaled $87 million in the quarter. This compared to $56 million last year and includes the addition of TMC and MERS, both of which were acquired in the second half of 2018. Turning next to Slide 6, I'll discuss our data and listing segment. Starting with listings. Revenues of $111 million, were up 2% year-over-year, while the U.S. government shutdown delayed IPO activity through the end of January. The NYSE helped raise over $2.5 billion of IPO proceeds during the quarter. In addition, the second quarter is off to a strong start. With year to date proceeds raised now in excess of $5 billion including the Pinterest IPO in April. Both Uber and Falck have also recently announced their choice of the NYSE as their listing partner. Moving the data. On a constant currency basis data services revenues grew 6% year-over-year to a record $546 million. In pricing and analytics revenues increased 6% over the prior year. The automation of fixed-income workflows and the growth in passive strategies is continuing to drive increased demand for our evaluative pricing services both real-time and end of day as well as our reference data and our index offerings. Exchange data in these revenues grew 8% year-over-year driven by growth in the number of customers using our futures data and improve market share at the NYSE, which determines the revenue we received from the share take plan. And finally, desktops and conductivity revenue was up 3% versus last year. Conductivity services related to our futures exchanges generated solid growth benefiting from the aforementioned increase in our customer base. Mitigating this strength conductivity revenues related to the NYSE were roughly flat. As we continue to rollout our pillar technology, which we expect will improve efficiency while reducing industry costs. We believe the momentum in data revenue growth will continue in the second quarter with revenues expected to increase sequentially to a range of between $550 million and $555 million. Our competence is supported by an annual subscription value that was 6% higher than a year ago entering the quarter. 2019 is off to a great start. The resiliency of the business model we have constructed is evident and our ability to deliver the second best earnings and cash generation quarter in our company's history despite a challenging backdrop for industry trading volumes. I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Sprecher : Thank you, Scott and good morning to everyone on the call. I'll begin on Slide 7. Our first quarter performance highlights the value of the organic and inorganic initiatives that have undertaken over the last year. We've been engaged in a deliberate evolution to add growing subscription-based revenues and to increase our addressable market by expanding our asset class coverage. Despite softer trading volumes across our industry in the first quarter, and as a result of this evolution, we grew revenue, earnings per share and free cash flow and we returned nearly $600 million in capital to our shareholders, the second most in any quarter in our history. 10 years ago, we were largely commodities trading venue. At the time, roughly 85% of our revenue was transaction-based. Today, half of our business is recurring revenue in nature and spans a diverse set of asset classes. Asset classes that we think are well positioned to continue to grow. At roughly 30% of our business, commodities markets still remain an important component of our growth profile. We offer a full spectrum of risk management tools that are critical to the daily hedging and trading needs of global energy and agricultural commodity market participants. Global benchmark contracts such as Brent crude oil, Gasoil, sugar and European natural gas, the name of few, Anchor what is the industry's most diverse commodity in complex. Our financial markets businesses home to futures on global interest rates and equity indices, such as the MSCI index complex, where we recently launched a suite of new indices as we partner to expand the range of risk management tools offered to our customer base. In our cash equities business, the New York Stock Exchange stands as the leading provider of listing and trading services. We are the listing venue of choice for the world's largest and most sophisticated company, and as the deepest liquidity pool for equities on the planet. The NYSE provides customers with a state-of-the-art technology platforms helping to reduce volatility as well as reducing their trading costs. In our fixed income business, an asset class that now represents about 1/4 of our revenue with the leading global provider of a value to pricing and reference data. Our pricing and reference data business is also the foundation for our index business and for our comprehensive suite of pre-trade and post-trade analytics. This suite of data services together with its institutional customer connectivity, it's highly complementary to ICE bonds. Execution venues that offer our customers choice across execution protocols including auction, click-to-trade and RFQ convention. Demand for automation in the fixed income markets is accelerating, and whether it's through initiatives such as our ETF hub or new data products such as real time pricing curves, best execution analytics or indices. Our platform of fixed income assets is uniquely positioned to capture this growth trend. Similarly, the U.S. residential mortgage market is experiencing an analog-to-digital conversion. It's an evolution that we've seen before and much like in other asset classes, we're providing products, services and key infrastructure aimed at facilitating that transformation. Digital mortgage solutions are gaining traction. The electronic mortgage notes or eNotes are an important step towards a fully electronic mortgage ecosystem. And in the first quarter alone, more eNotes were registered on MERS than in all quarters of 2018 combined. eNotes can bring meaningful efficiency gains to the industry by shortening closing time, improving quality control, and helping to reduce friction. And with eNotes representing less than 1% of the outstanding mortgage is today. The opportunity for future growth is substantial. Turning now to Slide 8, as you may have seen last night, we announced the acquisition of Simplifile. Simplifile is the leading provider of electronic recording services to the mortgage industry, helping to streamline the real estate transaction process. It operates one of the largest mortgage networks connecting originators, settlement agents, servicers and counties. It's a network that's been constructed over two decades and includes transaction recording counties that together represent 80% of the U.S. population. With the electronification of the mortgage industry, and its early innings of transformation, the number of eligible documents that could record digitally is four times the size of what Simplifile currently handles. When combined into ICE mortgage services, we will be better positioned to address the increasing demand for digital mortgage solutions, helping the mortgage industry reduced costs and making the closing process simpler, faster, and more transparent. Turning now to Slide 9, we remain committed to balancing our growth today with ensuring that the groundwork is laid for growth tomorrow. An example of this is our effort to support the development of an institutional market for digital assets. Based on feedback from institutional investors seeking a way to participate in this nation asset class, we're building out key infrastructure starting with a custody platform. Secure custody of private keys on Bakkt will feature the high level of cybersecurity oversight that protects our global markets, coupled to the regulatory structure of a qualified custodian or which Bakkt has now applied. Earlier this week, Bakkt announced and it acquired the digital asset custody company to further scale its capabilities and also announced that it is working with BNY Mellon to enhance its physical security and geographic diversity of custody. Bakkt is building a strong team, including senior leadership with experience from ICE, PayPal, Vantiv, Worldpay, Coinbase and Google Wallet. And Bakkt remains focused on launching physical delivery futures on our ICE futures U.S. exchange to enable trusted pricing within the digital asset ecosystem and to facilitate institutional adoption. In summary, we're excited about the addressable market that we have in front of us, and while our business is certainly larger and more diverse than it was only 10 years ago, we're still guided by a management team that operates in sync and we are growth focus. Our integrated platform enables us to drive efficiencies across our technology and our operation, while still significantly investing for future growth, which is clear in our operating margins of nearly 60%. And our footprint provides us with unique foundation to drive growth, while continuing to create value for shareholders. So I'd like to thank our customers for their business and their trust in the quarter. And I want to thank all of my colleagues for their efforts that contributed to another very strong quarter price. With that, I'll now turn the call back to our moderator, Sherry, to conduct the question-and-answer session and that will last until 9 :30 Eastern Time. Operator : Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Mr. Michael Carrier of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Carrier : All right, thanks and good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just the first question, some of that fixed-income business, you guys have done well on the data side. I think on the trading, the team is a bit more competitive with some of the encumbered platforms out there. So how are you thinking or strategically how are you differentiating between the other platforms that are already in the market in order to win over the next few years? Ben Jackson : Thanks, Michael. This is Ben Jackson. And I think Jeff captured it in the comments that he was making in his opening script there. In that the key differentiator that we have is the scale and size of our fixed-income business when you look at it as a vertical and it represents now 1/4 of our revenues across our entire revenue base. So think about a $1.3 billion business. And if you look at the cornerstone of that $1.3 billion business \u2013 in that is really our data businesses. The data businesses that we've established with pricing, reference data, index and analytics capabilities that we provided to customers for more than three decades, data businesses and data services are very hard to establish with customers. You have to have a long track record of a trust for them to trust that you as a benchmark price that they're going to references it takes a long time to establish the credibility in our relationship. And it\u2019s both institutional relationships that we have solidified over multiple decades that really is our differentiator that we're going to leverage as it comes into execution. For execution platforms themselves, we've seen similar performance to what you've seen from the other platforms that have recently announced. We had strong performance in corporates, in U.S. corporates, we've seen trade sizes increased. We have seen a little bit of relative weakness in municipals as the spread between municipals and treasuries has narrowed. And treasuries have coming to favor but we have seen treasuries perform very strong on our platform. So net-net our platforms what we've done in Q1 is we have fully integrated our ICE bonds business to now execute as one business. We restructure the organization rationalize and take some cost out and now have a single vision to leverage the institutional relationships that we've established over multiple decades. So that's really what you see as our differentiator. Michael Carrier : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : The next question is from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Rich Repetto : Yes. Good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Scott. And first thanks for Slide 7, Jeff has guided. It's been we have an experience watching the company expanded over the years. So anyway my question is on what you've schooled us on Scott, the annual subscriber value for market data and went up nicely. But again, you talk about this what we're working on right now is 2020 revenue for market data. And I guess the questions \u2013 I know you've accelerated the growth from the low single digits to the 4% to 6% now. But as you go forward is there any \u2013 as you add this annual subscriber value is there any momentum \u2013 anything to point that you can grow it faster than the upgrade you have right now? And is it still coming from the same sort of buckets that you talked about when you \u2013 a couple of years ago when you first gave some guidance on good growth there? Scott Hill : Yes. Thanks for the question, Rich. And I do think the ASV is a good metric to focus on because it is forward-looking. As I proved last year, it doesn't give perfect forecast but it's directionally very indicative. I think the key thing you see not just in ASV but in the growth trends we've established. Our compound growth rate since 2015 through the end of 2018 was just under 6% every year on average. This quarter we grew 6%. That's the third quarter in a row that we put up 6%. And if you look at our guidance for the second quarter, we're again going to be kind of in that 5% to 6% range at the midpoint being around \u2013 right around 5.5%. So it's a growth trend that's been consistently delivered in ASV indicated it can continue. And it can continue because some other things that we've talked about in the script, there are a lot of tailwinds in the fixed-income space. There's a move from active to passive management. There's a move that Ben spent a lot of time talking about towards bond ETFs, which if you look at relative to equity ETF is a much smaller space, but one where everybody is pointing to a strong future. And so I think in the fixed-income area and that's largely our pricing and analytics business which you've grown 6%, 7% ever quarter for the last four or five quarters, it's really those trends that have driven it and continue to drive it. I think if you then look at the exchange data and the connectivity piece, again, I go back to the remarks I made, we continue to see more customers wanting our data and connecting to our platform. And so our connectivity services related to futures exchanges was up solidly again this quarter. Our futures exchange data was up again this quarter. And that goes back to the nature of the commodities business the futures business that we offer. We offer a global set of interest rates that are subject to European economic and European Central Bank dynamics and Federal Reserve dynamic. We offer commodities and energy space that most comprehensive global oil market, the most competitive global natural gas market, the most comprehensive global ag market and we continue to see commercial customers, who are managing their price risk exposures in our market and that drives a demand for connectivity and for exchange data. And so again, I would suggest to you, you've been seeing that in the growth results we put up, I think it's definitely reflected in our first quarter and second quarter guidance and I see \u2013 I think you see it in the ASV which indicates that those trends continue. Rich Repetto : Okay. Thanks, Scott. Operator : The next question is from Mr. Patrick O'Shaughnessy of Raymond James. Please go ahead, sir. Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Hey, good morning. To follow up on the first question on your fixed-income business, is there any quantification you can provide regarding customer growth or average trade size? And kind of metrics that you can provide what's that \u2013 what indicate that you're progressing along your goals? Scott Hill : Thanks, Patrick. I think \u2013 as I mentioned we've seen relative performance to what you've seen from the other platforms this past quarter with corporates being strong and municipals in particular seeing some relative weakness. If you look at our platforms, we do have a bit of a tilt in our mix towards municipals. So we did see that impact the businesses to some degree. But all that said, trends that we've seen and as we're leveraging the rest of our businesses to really move into the institutional space some of the metrics that I've said in prior calls that we continue to see is trending very positive is the development of our RFQ capabilities to move into the institutional space and RFQ represents close to 20% of our trading volumes on a day-in and day-out basis. We continue to see \u2013 and continue to develop that and continue to see customers utilizing that. We have on our platform on any given day over 10,000 securities that have prices of $250 up on either side. So that it\u2019s real indicator that central limit order book trading in fixed income is starting to develop. And we look forward to continuing to provide customers choice on central order book trading options through our click-to-trade protocol in addition to our RFQ capabilities that we have built out on the back of a long standing capability that you've had in all of our futures markets and being able to provide that protocol as well. So it's \u2013 those two pieces and leveraging the institutional relationships that we have across our business that we believe well positions us to continue to change the mix of assets that are trading on our platforms and also increasing trade sizes. Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dan Fannon : Thanks. I guess one more on fixed-income. Just to make sure that we're thinking about what your goals are. I guess what is the kind of right way to gauge success? Is it because we don't really have market share we're not getting clean data yet? Is it aggregate revenues? Or I guess what just kind of holds you accountable in terms of that success? What should we think about as a goal post as we think about the remainder of this year or even further? Jeff Sprecher : It's a good question. This is Jeff. It\u2019s complicated press because we don't run our businesses the way we recorded them on the chart. In other words, we have an integrated management team and we are running all those businesses together and honing the common technology platforms where we can do it in common sales and marketing efforts. But if you step back the goal post that we set internally as senior management, I referenced in my prepared remarks, that 10 years ago we are a very different company. We were sitting here around 10 years ago thinking, wow, there's going to be an analog-to-digital conversion in fixed-income. How do we participate? And we were pretty knowledgeable. We are very knowledgeable about markets, because this management team has been together a long time and our team had a lot of international cross border experience. And we decided to go right for the high value part of the business. The high value part of the business is in mature markets is not the execution. And I can tell you a very mature New York Stock Exchange has 12 other exchange competitors and five more that are rumored to be signing up and some estimate as many as 50 different venues, where you can execute trades on U.S. equities. The high value part of the business is getting those institutional relationships getting your data, your connectivity, your higher value products on the people's systems, it's very hard when you're running a fund to change your benchmarks, to change your underlying data as people consume information that it perpetuate through organizations and becomes institutionalized. So in looking at fixed-income market and the difficulty that we all had in our industry are how to digitize that. We decided to start with where we thought the higher value part is. So you've seen growth, Scott talked about ASV and we talked about our company as a data company and how that is performing. The reality is what you're really seeing there is those fixed-income trends against a very, very weak market for commodities and equities in other asset classes in the quarter. And so it's why we decided to try to better show you how the business operates. We'll take it away that other metrics that we can put out. We don't run the business that way. So it's hard we don't have those metrics at our fingertips. I'll just make one other point which is, 10 years ago we were in the interest-rate business and we had a very formidable exchange competitors like CME and Deutsche B\u00f6rse and LSC and at that time NYSE Euronext that had very strong interest-rate franchise. So what did we do? We looked and said the nature part of the market where there's no analog-to-digital conversion yet its mortgage, that's the interest rate market that we should go after. And so we're starting to see some of the decisions that we made 10 years ago play out and it implies spent a little bit of time talking about Bakkt and digital assets. I don't know where did that company will go, none of us knew, but we have the luxury in this company of a being have an entrepreneurial team and the ability to make investments that are very strategic and still maintain our operating margin given the technology footprint that we have. So anyway that's the overarching theme here and we'll take away specific metric interest and see if we can come up. Dan Fannon : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Mr. Jeremy Campbell of Barclays. Please go ahead. Jeremy Campbell : Hey, Thanks. Jeff, just piggybacking on that mortgage commentary there, I mean, now with MERS and Simplifile can you just provide some color how ICE mortgage services fits within the existing kind of mortgage technology infrastructure? So for instance, I think of like Black Knight that has something like 80% of mortgage services on their technology platform, with also a large origination technology platform. Is something like that a partner for ICE mortgage services a competitor or just an entirely different stereo of influence? Jeff Sprecher : It's very good question. So when we bought MERS. MERS was really \u2013 is a company that registers if you will paper-based mortgages. It gives every U.S. mortgage, Mortgage Identification Number, all the MIN number Mortgage Identification Number and that's for paper-based e-comm system. What we did is over two years we built the digital ecosystem and we worked with Fannie and Freddie to hook that digital ecosystem to them as an endpoint. And we started with these eNotes that we mentioned, which is essentially stock mortgage, it's all loan document. Can we get the industry to digitize the essential loan document and send that to Fannie and Freddie? Now \u2013 and to each other to the extent they want to. Now we're going to have Simplifile, which says, okay I can send that same mortgage to be recorded as a closing. So we're starting to build the backend of endpoints if you will. There are a lot of companies out there that have digitized at the frontend, there's a very competitive market when you arrive go get a mortgage today we may be on a digital platform or we talking to somebody in an office that\u2019s actually typing into the digital platform. It's highly competitive space and those and well worn in the industry itself to sort of start the time to figure out how to automate the frontend. We would hope that we're going to have an open API on this network that we're building. We're hoping that those people will plug-in what they're doing and onto our network, so that those essential digital documents can be codified and recorded. There are literally hundreds of documents that exist in the world that go into a mortgage. Your mortgage provider last year tax return they want to see 1099, they want you to go various forms are somewhat unique to them, they want past employment history, they may do a credit search. All of that stuff, if there is an industry that\u2019s trying to organize that as you mentioned and it's in various states of way. But largely in today's world, that\u2019s all gets printed out into paper documents and put in boxes and store it somewhere. And there's so many different fields that are entered into on those forms because that they're not that standardized. There are acronyms and conventions and things that are hard for people to translate to bring that whole file together. And so what we've done and said, let's start with the nugget, the essential core, which is the actual note itself and then allow we'll build some of it and we\u2019ll have this network build with others can plug-in to it. And let's try to get the entire industry standardizing around our network if you will which will be the essential way to close the transaction. Jeremy Campbell : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Mr. Kyle Voigt of KBW. Please go ahead, sir. Kyle Voigt : Hi, good morning. Maybe a switch gears to the trading business. I know, you're seeing some really good growth in global oil and other energy products. But Brent is still the large futures product by revenue and we've seen some soft open interest threat throughout the past two years there. Just wondering if you can talk about why you think we haven't been seeing some of the same type growth more historical growth rates in Brent at least we have the past two years? And if there's anything in the horizon that could we reaccelerate those growth rates? Ben Jackson : Hi, Kyle. It's Ben. Thanks for the question. And yes, we have seen what we view as a temporary pullback in open interest volumes in Brent. And I think which you can point to is a lot of this happened in particular in the last two-three weeks. You can point to a lot of very unforeseen events that have recently happened. Things such as removal of waivers against the Brent oil sanctions, new bands being implemented on Venezuelan oil and now the potential for contagion in Russian oil, all of this has led to a pretty uncertain environment for traders. And while you'll hear us as an exchange operator and others, point to times of volatility be great for volumes was not great for volumes is complete uncertainty. And an area where there is a complete unforeseen event that happens which tend to see and what we've seen over time is the traders will go into a risk off mode and they\u2019ll take a step back, assess the situation and tried to form a view on directionally where the market is going. And we think that's what we're seeing in Brent itself. But you touched on an area that we're seeing that we are seeing growth and it's made up of significant amount of the pull of that recent temporary pullback and that's in that global oil complex. And when you think about what is that global oil complex, you've got a whole suite of products that basically hang off of Brent, Gasoil and our WTI business. So these are products that are very precise basis locations for people to hedge risk at a point of consumption or a point of production in North America, in the Middle East, in Europe and across Asia. You see complementary spread in differential contracts between Brent and Gasoil and these contracts. You also see refined products spreads. So a barrel of oil versus refined products that come off of it oftentimes called crack spreads. We've seen significant growth in this part of the complex with open interest up 6% year-over-year and volumes up 18% year-over-year. So when you combine this whole complex as one global oil business with over 500 contracts that have been developed with our commercial traders at the core you see a complex that's priced two-thirds of the world's oil. It has led and continues to lead in open interest market share and has gained market share over the past year and that's a global complex that includes both futures, options, and all of our oil products together. So we're going to begin to work with our commercial customer base to build that out. Kyle Voigt : Got it. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Blostein : Hey, guys. Good morning. Just another follow-up around the mortgage business, can you guys update us on the \u2013 I guess the revenues and expense contribution from the Simplifile business that you bought? I think the press release just mentioned strong track record of revenues, revenue growth and profitability just trying to pencil out what that is? And then Jeff definitely helpful summary of kind of what MERS is and kind of what it does? But again maybe update us on what the revenue there stands today? And I guess bigger picture how does this business ultimately going to leverage ICE's data and trading segments? Or is that meant to be really almost kind of like a standalone part of what you guys do? Scott Hill : Thanks for the question. I'm going to take the numbers part and then I'll hand it over to Jeff for the important stuff. So just quickly just in terms of the numbers Simplifile, we literally just signed it yesterday. And as we mentioned on the press release, we don't anticipate it closing until the third quarter. What we will do as we typically have is once we've closed it we'll update our guidance and give you the expense and the revenue associated with it. What I can tell you is that, when I give the expense update particularly if it's only in the fourth quarter and I'm hoping we could contain it in our current guidance and it'll be more than offset by revenue because it is a profitable business. So more to come on that, once we get the deal closed. And as we said in the press release that that will be sometime in the third quarter we anticipate. In terms of the MERS revenue, we actually had a strong first quarter. The business tends to correlate a little bit or I guess it's a negative correlation with interest rates. And so with them having moved a little bit higher as we move through last year. There's a little bit of concern it might impact that business. But as it stabilize the first quarter was actually relatively strong on a pro forma basis little above $20 million of revenue, we're up double digits year-over-year. And so you'll recall that we gave you guidance. I think of revenues $17 million to $19 million in the fourth quarter and we actually did a little better than $20 million in the first quarter. And as I think I mentioned on that call, as is gets to relatively low expense base. So high incremental margins like a lot of the other businesses that we operate. With that I'll hand it to Jeff to talk about how it fits. Jeff Sprecher : You're somewhat foreshadowing the ideas that we have here on data and analytics. Once a mortgage has been digitized and the information around it has been standardized so that it's searchable and can be run through analytics platforms. Fannie and Freddie theoretically ought to be able to more quickly get on an underwrite decision that would speed up that process, speed up funds flow and closing. And as Fannie and Freddie layoff risk in the market as they do today, they will allow the third-party that are going to undertake that risk to be able to do more research on the portfolio of mortgages that would be in there. So we do view that the data component of mortgage will become more interesting and valuable and will help drive down cost and speed up closing times. MERS when we acquired it was essentially a consortium and a membership organization with 5000 members. It has data policies within that the industry agreed to essentially. We've in taking control of the business, we've asked many of the companies that have been involved on the Board of Directors to stay on the Board. So we have representatives from the GSES from large banks and what-have-you. And really the reason that we ask them to stay on is to continue to contribute exactly to the dialogue that I just mentioned, which is what is the information that the industry wants and needs. How do we deal with PII information as we digitize things and make information more accessible? What are the levels of information that the market needs versus the need to be kept proprietary? Thinking about the expansion of this business globally and into other asset classes of lending. How does it meet the European standards and what-have-you? So those are all PPD future conversations that we started honestly when we first got involved in the business. And there'll be a natural by-product that I think of digitization and standardization's industry. Alex Blostein : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : The next question is from Mr. Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, sir. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks very much. I stay on the MERS topic. I think Jeff or Scott you mentioned about 1% of outstanding mortgages right now are electronically documented through the eNotes system. Can you help us think about the run rate half or the revenue growth half over the long term. Is it most \u2013 is it entirely dependent on new originations? Or is there a path to convert existing mortgage documents that don't have any activity to them electronically in terms of bringing up that mortgage? And then maybe just how many eNotes actually did you register in 1Q? I know it was more of 2018 altogether. Scott Hill : I'll start with second part of your question, 19,000 eNotes in Q1 still a very small when you think of it in the context of the U.S. mortgage industry is still nascent. But you've seen what's going on underneath that is the early adopters people that are anxious to become more digital have embraces this idea and are moving quickly to try to build it into their workflow. There's a broad cross-section people in mortgage industry that are talking to us and looking at the ATI or figuring out how to build it into their current workflow and it's not unlike any analog-to-digital transition that you witnessed in other asset classes. So what you see, our early adaptors are getting there quickly as they get in there and start to experience cost savings and ability to serve their customers better it's driving competition. So we are very encouraged by the early results even though it's a low number. The revenue model is simply we charge essentially in eNote on our platform and Simplifile charges the register in eNote and the more that that can all be put into one workflow to make it easy for the lender and mortgage underwriters. You can imagine that the pace of increase. As for existing documents there are a number of companies out there that are exploring how to go back and digitize existing mortgages. There's a lot of error rate in dealing with boxes of paper mortgages that exists in warehouses when there is a change of servicing rights when there is a foreclosure. And one of the things that Simplifile and MERS has been working on over the last decade is changing local law and what-have-you so that the golden record if you will can be digital that the original mortgage you may recall during the last financial crisis people showed up with global sign mortgages in courts and many judges rejected them. And as a result MERS the entity that was hoping to find and produce those mortgages on behalf of the original lenders. And so moving to an electronic system with a golden record, which is much like what's done in many other asset classes that can be respected by the courts will potentially be a reason that all these legacy mortgages will be scanned and put into that system. And like I had of the meeting on \u2013 I actually had a meeting on this topic yesterday with a third-party, who wanted to talk about how they can plug into MERS and they would offer this kind of services. Brian Bedell : So do anticipate being able to get say, bulk transfers of existing mortgages without any activities or no refi or no foreclosure or no new mortgage. Just go into some record keepers and be able to do a giant bulk transfer of those existing paperback to eNotes? Jeff Sprecher : Potentially the problem is that those records are not standardized. And you need essentially not just the ability to scan but you need essentially artificial intelligence or rules-based engine. That on a document that says, somebody is named Robert and another document has him down as Bobby but that's the same person. And where people have made errors in writing social security numbers down and all this other stuff you can get it pretty quickly into chaos. So the people that are \u2013 there are people looking at this are trying to figure out is their ability to scan those create an indelible record that will be respected by the courts and in foreclosure and store that record pointed at MERS and the eNote and allow the marketplace itself to better transfer potentially those mortgages between one another particularly in sourcing rights, which happens quite often. Brian Bedell : Okay, great. Thank you so much for the color. Operator : There's a follow-up question from Mr. Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill. Please, go ahead sir. Rich Repetto : Yes. Hi, Just a question for Ben on the fixed-income side. When you're back in to the revenue it looks like for TMC and BondPoint it looks like revenue went down quarter-to-quarter. And I know you mentioned Ben some softness in the muting market but it did look like from a trace volumes that there was a record volume in 1Q. So just trying to understand the actual revenue from the fixed-income on the trading side? Ben Jackson : Yes, Rich. I tried to hit that on the comments I made earlier where a lot of it has to do with a mix so the municipal space. And our platforms compared to the others that you see out there tend to be more tilted towards the municipal space. And the muni space has had a rough go at it lately. Again given that spread between treasuries and munis has narrowed and treasuries have come into favor. So what we have seen is that treasuries have picked up, but treasuries tend to be at a lower price per transaction. So what we do see is that with the efforts that we have underway and that I've talked about on prior calls with the ETF hub initiative and the build-out of our RFQ, we are continuing to advance those efforts. And with ETF hub on schedule to be released later this year. We see that initiatives like that as well as the connection that we're building across the institutional businesses that we have. We'll continue to change that mix as well as increase the average trade size that we'll see on the platform. Rich Repetto : Got it. Thank you. Operator : It's a follow-up question from Mr. Patrick O'Shaughnessy of Raymond James. Please go ahead sir. Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Hey, great. Thank you. So Bakkt has obviously some pretty well-publicized delays since you announced the initiative. How do you think about the market opportunity for Bakkt and how that's changed since you really launched the effort? Jeff Sprecher : Well, to be completely transparent with you it's really been helpful that the cryptocurrency industry sort of went into what they call a winter that took some of the heat off of the timetable to launch. There's been a \u2013 and secondly we've actually been looked at a number of different companies and acquired a company earlier this week that wouldn't have been available to us had the market really been hot because valuations were really hot. So I see this kind of maturation that's going on where for example the people the blockchain engineers that we acquired through our recent acquisition became really interested if you will in affiliating with a larger more corporate if you will effort to move the industry forward. There's a lot of interest still in this market. It's not when we talk about institutions, the institutions are regulated, the banks are regulated, the regulators are trying to get their arms around this asset class and how to regulate it. And we want to be a regulated venue, which is why it's taken a while. But that said, you can't really get into the true institutional markets that we serve without being highly regulated and highly trusted. And so the juices worth the squeeze in terms of the way and it's going well now. There were a lot of things that had to get shorted out over jurisdiction and custody and how these \u2013 what will happen in a bankruptcy. And those kinds of issues that in my mind need to be resolved before there's going to be wide adoption of the asset class. And we been at the forefront solving those and building the solutions for those and we're very, very close now to finalizing all of that. So once we're sure this sort of downturn in the value of these assets allowed us to attract some really great people and gave legislators and regulators the time to think about particularly in the United States how to deal with this asset class. Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Mr. Chris Allen of Compass Point. Please go ahead. Chris Allen : Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask a follow-up on the muni market in general. Where does that market stand in terms of electronification particularly in the institutional side? What are the impediments if there are any right now? And how do you see that kind of evolving moving forward? Ben Jackson : Thanks, Chris. Yes. So the municipal space it is far behind or even U.S. corporates are. So if you look at estimates of the U.S. corporate market in terms of how much is electronic being 20% to 25% but clearly moving more and more electronic. The municipal space is further behind where our estimates are call it 10% to 12% of it are electronic. We are seeing that continue to move more electronic or beneficiary of that obviously. But the municipal space structurally has been tough for the point that I brought up before with spreads between municipals and treasuries coming down. But also if you just look at muni issuance, if you look back two years ago it's significantly higher than where it is now. Now it's starting to just rebound at this point and as new issuance starts to come around, we should see some benefit in the secondary trading on that. And it takes a while to get behaviors to change from the analog type of transaction. But it's early days but we are starting to see that move as well. Chris Allen : Has the banks taking any steps towards launch tranche any munis? Scott Hill : Similar to corporates the dialogues that we're having with banks is that they started certain trade sizes and started small trade sizes and looking to electronify that. And then over time as they get more and more comfortable with it they'll move up that threshold in terms of what's the minimum size that they no longer want a phone involved in that transaction. They want to build more algorithms into pricing those trades, more electronic execution in pricing those trades and municipals are just a few years behind where corporates are. Chris Allen : Thanks, guys. Operator : The next question is a follow-up from Michael Carrier of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Sameer Murukutla : Hey guys. This is actually Sameer Murukutla, Mike had to jump off. A quick question related to your thought process around acquisition especially in the fixed-income space. Maybe can you give an update on how you think about the return in increasing goals? Meaning, historically it's been a focus but given some of the structural growth in certain areas would you sacrifice those goals if you think the structural growth make up for it over a longer period? Jeff Sprecher : I guess, the operative part of your question for me is longer period. We try to be very disciplined about our return on invested capital. We feel like we can pay a premium for a business if we can put it on our platform and quickly grow it or digitize it. And also integrate the business so that if we look generally out three years, we want to start to see very high returns on invested capital. We give ourselves \u2013 we tend to give ourselves three years to integrate a business and honestly internally we try to drive ourselves to two. And so we want to see very positive results mathematically coming out of that. I'm smiling, because we built $1 billion revenue business in fixed- income. I think without a lot of people realizing what we were doing because we really didn't talk about it in that way. And we were able to acquire key parts of that business at valuations that were incredibly low relative to where people are valuing fixed-income assets today. I'm not sure that the market has recognized that it's partly why we decided to pull the curtain back a little on this call and give you more color on what we look like today. And so I don't know now that that sort of the curtains now that the wizard is visible, I'm not sure that we're going to be able to continue to find interesting assets that deliver on the metrics that I just tried to describe but we're always looking. Ben Jackson : Yes. I think the only thing I would add to that, as you've heard us talk about our acquisition how does it fit our strategy, how does it enable our growth, how quickly can we integrate it, how many synergies can regenerate, what's the return on investment. You've seldom heard us say the word accretion. Because at the end of the day you can financially engineer accretion you can't financially engineer returns. And if the deal done strategically, you are not likely to be able to get those returns. And so that we showed you the model a couple of summers ago and it was in the case before we showed it to you, it is the case now that it's about strategic fit, it's about growth and its about returns. Those are the things that matter and it's one of the reasons you see our return on invested capital now back at 9% when our weighted average cost of capital is only 6% because we do focus on creating economic value. Sameer Murukutla : Thanks for the color. Jeff Sprecher : Thank you. Warren Gardiner : Well it' s 9 :30. So with I think we'll wrap up. I'm sorry, Sherry, are you going to wrap it up for me? Operator : Sorry, I was just going to say, back over to you, excuse me. Jeff Sprecher : Thank you. Currently I was more anxious to get off the call. But thank you all. It was a great quarter and we'll look forward to reporting our next quarter results soon. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Intercontinental Exchange Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be on listen-only mode.  After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Warren Gardiner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Warren Gardiner : Good morning. ICE's second quarter 2019 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived, and our call will be available for replay. Scott Hill : Thanks, Warren. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide four, with some of the key highlights from our second quarter performance. Earnings per share totaled $0.94, up 4% versus the prior year and equal to our record fourth quarter performance. During the second quarter, we generated the second highest quarterly revenues in our company's history which yielded record adjusted operating income and record adjusted EBITDA. And importantly, first half free cash flow increased 13%year-over-year enabling us to return over $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Consolidated net revenues in the quarter were $1.3 billion with trading and clearing and data and listings both increasing 5% year-over-year on a constant current basis. Adjusted operating expenses totaled $540 million in the quarter, including roughly $5 million nonrecurring benefit primarily in tech expense. Additionally, second quarter expenses reflect both the reclassification of certain licensing agreements from net revenues to expenses as well as a small amount related to our acquisition of Simplifile in late June. Ben Jackson : Thank you, Scott, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'll begin on slide seven. Over the last 20 years how energy is produced and consumed has rapidly evolved, so too have global trade flows, as well as the technology and data available to market participants. We have continuously invested alongside this evolution building a global platform that today is one of the most diverse and liquid energy marketplaces in the world. In our oil business, Brent crude stands as the cornerstone of a franchise spanning key price benchmarks such as Gasoil, WTI, and Platts Dubai, which is one of the leading markers for crude traveling through Asia. Together these benchmarks form the foundation for a cohesive web of more than 600 related oil products such as locational spreads, product spreads and refining spreads. These are precise risk management tools that benefit from the deeper liquidity in and their relationship to our global oil benchmarks. Driven by the breadth of our commercial customer base, we have become the natural home for liquidity in these products with open interest in our global oil products up 25% year-over-year to over 5.5 million contracts or over 40% of our total oil open interest. Our global natural gas complex spans trading hubs across North America, Europe and Asia. The globalization of natural gas is a trend we've been investing in for over five years. Beginning with our investment in index. That investment established us as a leader in European gas trading. With Asia as the largest buyer of global LNG, the relationship between our European benchmark and Platts JKM, our Asian benchmark is driving global price formation. These new dynamics demand that commercials, investors and traders have a global view. European customers must be aware of supply and demand factors in Asia just as a buyer in Asia must be cognizant of trends facing European markets. LNG shipments out of the Gulf are increasingly pricing away from Henry Hub. And as our benchmarks become more global, we are seeing participation increased with the number of trading firms in our European TTF market doubling since 2015, while average daily volume has increased a 124% this year alone. In addition, a few weeks ago, we announced an agreement to extend our partnership with Platts to bring the eWindow platform to the global LNG trading community replicating our successful strategy in the oil markets. Jeff Sprecher : Thank you, Ben, and good morning to everyone on the call. The evolution of our energy market is one example of how we're continuously investing and developing customer driven solutions across asset classes, as well as the creative approach we've taken to leverage our infrastructure, our technology and our expertise to drive value creation. In areas such as data services, we're leveraging our core fixed income pricing and reference data, developing new fixed income benchmarks such as our suite of muni indices and launching real-time fixed income yield curves and credit risk tools. We're investing in our fixed income analytics, enhancing the functionality and now delivering it through an API to broaden the addressable market. In the second quarter, we launched the ICE Data Vault, a cloud-based data repository that leverages our consolidated feed business and delivers historical data from over 600 global sources. And we've invested in our sales footprint, adding coverage across both the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. These are just a few examples of the initiatives and the new products that we're bringing to the market. Operator : We will now begin a question-and-answer session.  The first question will come from Richard Repetto of Sandler O'Neill. Richard Repetto : Good morning, Jeff, Scott, and Ben. It's been an early morning for some of us. And I guess with the LSE Refinitiv confirmation of the announcement this morning, it seems like they've taken a page out of your playbook with a focus on market data and certainly they have some fixed income and FX trading platforms as well. I guess, the question, Jeff, is you know how do you see this impacting your businesses, this one-stop shopping for market data? And how would you differentiate what you're offering versus what could be a potential LSE Refinitiv combined platform? Jeff Sprecher : Well, that's a great question. Thanks for asking it. First of all, we are fortunate that we saw the move to that kind of pivot very early so that we were able to acquire some very, very strategic assets that what today would be viewed as incredibly attractive valuations to build the foundation for what we offer today. And as you see the footprint that we\u2019ve pivoted towards in data was really around fixed income data more than anything. And in that space \u2013 it's a unique space, and one of the things that we were able to acquire with IDC was a 50-year-plus history of a high quality fixed income data that is hard to replicate for new entrants simply because of time. And what we find is people, the buy side and sell side that are doing analytics and what have you, need that rich robust data set in order to back test portfolio theories and other things. Separately, the fixed income business is interesting in that only a very tiny amount of fixed income trades on any given day. It's probably less than 5% of fixed income names in the muni space where we\u2019ve really put a big investment. It's less than 1%. And so, the algorithms and knowledge base that comes from that foundation is really important much more so than the trading platforms, which is why we \u2013 as we realized that we pivoted hard into acquiring indices, legacy data sets, and other relationships as opposed to execution venues as you've seen, because that will not change with the electronification of the business in our mind. So, we're well-positioned. It's a space we expect more competition in. It\u2019s a space we expect more consolidation around. One of the facts that I mentioned years ago that we began to see partly by acquiring the New York Stock Exchange is that it's very hard to have connectivity to many, many customers because of cybersecurity issues. People want a smaller number of large vendors that have the scale to guarantee that connectivity -- direct connectivity to companies is safe, and so it was somewhat inevitable that there was going to be a roll up in the space, and as I said, that's why we chose some assets quickly and went hard at them very early. Operator : The next question will come from Michael Carrier of Bank of America. Michael Carrier : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. First, Scott maybe just on the expenses and the guidance on slide 11, just with the gross and the net expense guide, can you just provide some color on the revenue offsets and maybe which lines that will be flowing through for the second half? Scott Hill : Sure. Yes. So, slide 11 is the good one to look at. I think the key point I would highlight there is effectively what we did this quarter was bringing the midpoint of our original guidance down by $25 million. And then we added 50 million on top of it, and that's roughly 28 million which was simply a change in how we're treating some revenue share agreements that we have. We're going to treat those as net revenue now, not gross. That's about $28 million. And the vast majority of that is on our financials business, and you saw that in our RPC, which we adjusted the rolling three month is up a couple pennies. There's about $8 million in the second quarter, and then $10 million a quarter in third quarter and fourth quarter. The other piece is the addition of * Simplifile. As I mentioned that's 9 million to 10 million in the quarter. You could double that and let's assumed for the half it will be 18 million to 20 million. And that's where for the second half we expect revenues in excess of $30 million. And so, we've now got a mortgage business that annualized is a 140 million plus business at very attractive margins. And so, we're really excited about that. So, I think the way to think about expenses, they brought the midpoint down $25 million for the year. The growth in that change is no impact to the bottom line and Simplifile is immediately accretive and adds to a really large mortgage business in a quickly digitalizing space. Operator : The next question will come from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Ken Worthington : Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Maybe on ASV, it's up less now than it had been in the past. I think the calculation was something like 5.7% organic constant currency. It'd been in high, as high as maybe 6.7% a couple of quarters ago. So what are the biggest drivers in the decline in ASV? I think you guys mentioned equity data. Is there something else as well? Pricing and analytics growth seems to be around 4% now, that's less than it's been in the past. Maybe is that a driver as well. And then lastly, ASV does not capture all the outlook for data. Can you give us an update on the part of data that's not captured by ASV. How is that progressing? Scott Hill : That's a big bundle of questions. Let me see if I can go work my way through that. So, first of all, you're 100% right to be looking at the ASV metric. That is the key indicator of the very good health of our data business. Because that ASV number represents the 90% of our revenues roughly give or take, that Lynn and her team are outselling every day. The other are non-ASV stuff is session fees and NMS and tape data. We don't sell that. We don't really control that to a great extent. So, you're focused on the right metrics. I look at an ASV number. I think it was maybe 6.4% last quarter, 6.1% this quarter on a constant currency basis. They're between 5.7% and 6.7% in a given quarter. I don't lose much sleep on. As long as we're pivoting around 6%, I think that's really indicative of a data business that's positioned to deliver the kind of growth that you've seen from us over the past couple years. So, I think the ASV is well-positioned. There is a little bit of weakness on the NYSE exchange data. And that weakness is not that it's going backward. It's just not growing. And so that does have a bit of a downward impact. But the good news is, you look at futures exchange data, as I said growth in the quarter plus 7%, but no customer erosion at all. You hear from others that customers are going away, we're not seeing that. I think that reflects the commercial orientation of our market. You look at pricing & analytics where it dipped a little bit in the second quarter, but again, an instructive point in that audits come and go. And last year we had a few. The year before that we had a few. This year we didn't. And I mentioned that business is going to re-accelerate 5%, 6% in the third quarter, 6%, 7% in the in the fourth quarter, and coming off a 6% year headed back toward or another 6% year in pricing & analytics. So, again feel really good about that business, feel really good about the execution from Lynn and the team. And I think ASV metric is a really good indicator that that business is healthy and growing. And the thing that I also hope you noted in the quarter was as we start to get some of the foundational investments behind us in that data business you're starting to see the margin expansion that we would expect from the incremental revenue growth. So, we were up a couple of points year-over-year in the quarter. And again, I think that's reflective of the fact that that business its position to continue to grow is also likely to have very solid incremental margins and expansion overall. Jeff Sprecher : And Ken, let me just pile on by mentioning that Ben went over on Slide seven, how our energy business has really changed. We started -- when I started the company, we had natural gas was U.S. Henry Hub. Today, you look at the map on slide seven and you see that the energy business has pulled us to Europe and then EMEA, Asia. And so I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're investing in sales and marketing people in these new areas. In other words, the flow of data sales is following the flow of commercial interest in our products. And so it gives us some confidence. We get asked a lot about changes in large banks like yours,  changes that are going on around Brexit, changes in Europe, and what have you. But when you really look at the flow of the way people are integrating with our network you see that it's broadening globally and that's helping to drive those datasets. Operator : The next question will come from Kyle Voigt of KBW. Kyle Voigt : Hi. Good morning. Maybe just one more follow up on the LSE Refinitiv transaction. It sounded like from LSE's call this morning that the Refinitiv deal was really shaft or wasn't a highly competitive deal. So I guess my question is were you able to look at the asset prior to the LSE announcement last week. And then, I guess part two of that is just clearly is moving LSE bigger into the front office, which you mentioned in your prepared remarks, with their desktop business are Refinitiv, would that be an area you'd focus on if assets were available in that space in terms of M&A? Thanks. Jeff Sprecher : Good question. I'm unable to speak to the current transaction. But let me just say to you that, we had -- we've been relatively aggressive at the way we've built ICE over the last couple of decades. And we have had conversation around those assets for more than a decade with multiple management teams, who have had multiple ideas on how we might interface with those including acquisitions, joint ventures, bundling, cross licenses you name it. And we've watched those management teams and discuss with those management teams as they've made major investments in those assets, as they've pulled back from investments in those assets, as they've tried to do cost cutting around those assets, as they've tried to bundle with us, as they've focused on price increases, as they've focused on price decreases. And because it was a public company, we have watched with tremendous detail how those assets have evolved over decades. And so, we've had many opportunities to engage and we haven't found a way obviously that did something that would -- that we felt would really be accreted to ICE shareholders. That in no way as a comment on the current deal. David Schwimmer and David Warren are two people who I have known for years and highly respect, and are tremendous at what they do and have given us guidance from time to time. And also Joe Baratta and Martin Brand at Blackstone are amazingly sharp and savvy, and so I've got nothing but good feeling about those people in that deal that they did. But as a respects to ICE, over many, many years we were not able to find a way that we can create value. Operator : The next question will come from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Hey guys. Good morning. Thanks. So, maybe just a round up the discussion around LSE and Refinitiv, anyway you guys kind of help us think about exposure ICE Data Services has to Refinitiv. I think most of that is going to be on the exchange that aside. But within pricing & analytics is there any sort of revenue exposure there as well and how do you guys think of any potential risks to ICE on the back of that transaction? Jeff Sprecher : This is Jeff. I don't want to answer that question only because that particular transaction is going to go through a global antitrust review, and I don't want to say something that in any way is used in that review positively or negatively. So don't take that to mean anything other than there is a transcript being made of this call. And I'd rather not have us discussing that particular thing. You're going to give me a pass? Operator : The next question will come from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Can you talk about the ETF Hub in more detail and timing of launch, kind of your expectations and maybe some of the incentives that you're going to put out there to attract participants to that offering? Ben Jackson : Sure. Dan. This is Ben. And thanks for the question. So we've been talking about this on many calls and we're really excited about it, because we are deep in the testing phase right now with a lot of the institutional buy side and sell sides that are going to onboard onto this platform as it launches. And our target launch date is in the fourth quarter of this year and we feel really good about it on how the testing process has gone. One of things that excites us about this and Jeff had highlighted in some of the comments he made that we have a multi-decade relationship on the institutional side of these buy side and sell side firms between our pricing, our reference data, our analytics and our index offerings. And what this is enabling us to do is we're going to be really combining that set of offerings with our execution capabilities in TMC and BondPoint that have historically been in the wealth management space, but have protocols that are really oriented towards the new wave of electrification and fixed income with central order book trading. And you're obviously hearing that other platforms out there are trying to race to build similar capabilities to what these platforms already have. So, as we're now going through the testing process and we're now onboarding customers into the ETF Hub, these institutional customers through the testing process for the technical integration process as well as the legal onboarding we are coupling the onboarding process of that ETF Hub for a lot of these institutional buy sides that have traditionally not been on our venues to also onboard onto TMC, BondPoint, or auction in our RFQ protocols. So for the first time a lot of these institutional buyers and sellers will have an opportunity to use our venues that have historically not interacted with that order flow in the secondary market. So that's all upside for us to be able to compete in an area that we traditionally have in secondary trading. And in primary trading which is where the ETF Hub is, we're going to have as Jeff highlighted in his comments, the unique solution for the industry that solves a ton of inefficiency that there is. And because we're solving that inefficiency and helping all these market participants save an additional amount of cost, reduce risk and hopefully continue to grow an asset class that has seen explosive growth. We see recurring revenue opportunities coming from this, from clients onboarding on it as a natural output of it. Operator :  The next question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Good morning folks. I was going to ask one on the Refinitiv as well, but Jeff, you might not answer, given the global antitrust review. But one I'll ask and then I'll have a second question, you can pick one of the two. Jeff Sprecher : Okay. Fair enough. Brian Bedell : The Refinitiv one with just longer term thoughts on how it could change pricing in the industry given how you've gone out to a lot of large customers and have been able to successfully bundle a lot of data services together, whether the Refinitiv transaction changes that dynamic longer term in that strategy? And then the second question would be on energy. And the question there is given that product range that you guys outlined a lot in this call. Is there a view of broadening out the customer base there? You've traditionally been very happy in the commercial side to doing things to introduce more market making and proprietary trading and perhaps even retail usage of energy futures? Jeff Sprecher : I think we'll try to answer both questions. So, yes, I think you thread the needle. So, yes, the notion of trying to bundle content and distribution is something that's unique to financial services. It is the play in media and transportation and many other industries around the world. And so, I do think that that trend will continue. I do think that competition authorities are going to pay attention to that. And which is why I'm not prepared to get too in-depth with somebody else's strategy versus our strategy. But I think ultimately our industry has been going through consolidation, not just in platform providers, if you will like ICE, but buy side firms and sell side firms, and the way assets are gathered and managed. And so it's somewhat of an inevitability in my mind that you're going to see winners emerge. And as I mentioned, I'm glad that we made the transition early, so that that we had a look at all of these assets and could figure out which ones really would work for the specific kind of platform and distribution, and content that we think can continue to deliver top line growth. You can bundle downward growth as well you know. So the idea here is to create compelling bundles that more customers want that can drive EPS growth. And I know we've done that. Warren Gardiner : Youu want to pick up the . Jeff Sprecher : Yes. Warren Gardiner : Go ahead. Jeff Sprecher : So, on the energy side just to pick up on the question -- second question you had there. So you're right, we have focused on the commercial hedger in building out a diversified product suite around the world. And when we say that, we're focused on the commercial hedger. I think one of the important distinctions that not everyone appreciates is what we mean by that. What we mean is that, we've established a set of diversified products. So the product that people are actually consuming, whether it's various grades of crude oil or its refined products and also enabling at the point of consumption of those goods, putting locations around the world for where these customers are either buying or selling the end commodity. That enables them to as precisely as possible manage their exposure to price risk where they have the most acute risk, which is at that point of consumption. And this is distinct from many of the other peers that are out there, where they primarily focus on a single product and trying to attract customers, which could be halfway around the world to interact with a product that they may have no commercial connection to. If you look at products that we've developed in Asia for example like Singapore Gasoil, Fuel Oil, Singapore Jet Kerosene, these are a small sample set of hundreds and hundreds of products that we have around the world in our global oil and refined products suite that we've been partnering with our customers to build. And we have an -- have had \u2013 have today and continued to build on and grow market share in this part of our business as Scott had pointed out, open interest up 25% and volumes even accelerated this month to up 17% in this week . The last thing I'd point out is the reason we focus on the commercial is that to have a real vibrant market. It starts with the Cornerstone, which has to be the commercial trader that really cares about that physical instrument that's underpinning -- that's underpinning the price formation and the really the real risk around consuming the end good at the particular location. And what we've seen is, if you get that right, market makers, financials and those follow into that market. And that's what we've seen in all of the markets that we've developed. So we do focus on each of those areas that you had mentioned, but we really focus on getting the commercial aspect of it right first. And that's why we're seeing this area of our business significantly grow. Operator : The next question will be from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Chris Harris : So, part of ICE's value proposition in fixed income data is really offering valuation services for harder to value securities. So I'm wondering as more trading moves to electronic and becomes more transparent, how do you think this part of the data business will evolve? Ben Jackson : Thanks Chris. This is Ben. I'll take this. So I think one of comments Jeff made in an answer to a question earlier today is very important to highlight. In that if you look at the corporate bond space where you have 30,000 instruments, on a given day the number of instruments out of at 37 \u2013 or 30,000 corporate bonds that are out there, less than 2000 of those trade every single day. So even as electrification takes hold, you're talking about 5% or less of the market is actually trading in a given day. And with the explosion of data and the more precision the people want around managing their risk and pricing instruments moving not only from end of day, but to intraday, you can imagine the algorithm that's needed to understand what the correlations are of all the different instruments that actually do trade in given day, and having to figure out what does that mean for something that hasn't traded in a day, a week or a month. And when we talk about the multiple decades of being that trusted pricing and reference data provider to our customers, having that history, having that trust of being able to build out that complex algorithm, having trained it over many, many decades puts us in a position that I think is very, very strong. We'll continue to grow as data and information assets continue to grow around this space. Operator : And this concludes our question and answer session. I will now like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Sprecher for any closing remarks. Jeff Sprecher : Thank you, Carrie and thank you all for your participation in today's call. And we'll look forward to being back next question to similarly give you our great results. Operator *: Thank you, sir. The conference is now concluded. Thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a great day.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Warren Gardiner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Warren Gardiner : Good morning. ICE's third quarter 2019 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2018 Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including adjusted income, EPS, operating income, operating margin, expenses, effective tax rate, free cash flow and adjusted debt to EBITDA. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. To find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP term in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful as well as how management uses these measures in our 10-Q. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses, and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain terms. Scott Hill : Thanks, Warren. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our record third quarter results. Third quarter revenues grew 11% versus last year to a record $1.3 billion. Adjusted operating margins expanded 2 points to 59%, resulting in a record adjusted operating income, which grew 16%. This strong performance generated record adjusted earnings per share of $1.06, an increase of 25% over last year's third quarter and the best quarter in our company's history. Strong growth in our trading and clearing revenues was driven by 19% growth in energy and 23% constant currency growth in financials. Record data and listings revenues included data revenues of $553 million, which were up 5% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted operating expenses totaled $551 million, including a onetime benefit of roughly $6 million within SG&A. Expenses would otherwise have been right in the middle of our guidance. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $562 million to $572 million. This improves our full year 2019 expense guidance to a range of $2.18 billion to $2.19 billion. Importantly, though, as you think about our pro forma 2019, you'll need to add to that around $50 million to reflect a full year impact of Simplifile, the licensing reclass that started in the second quarter and the onetime items we've mentioned through the first three quarters. I also want to provide some color on our third quarter adjusted tax rate of 17.5% and the positive implications for 2020. Based upon additional guidance published in March related to the foreign derived intangible income, or FDII, aspect of the 2017 U.S. Federal Tax Reform, we were able to refine our 2018 return assumptions, which we just filed this month and our 2019 provision. These prior year and year-to-date true-ups are reflected in the low rate in 3Q, and the refined assumptions are expected to contribute to an adjusted tax rate of around 22.5% in the fourth quarter. More importantly, we expect these changes, combined with a scheduled U.K. tax reduction in April of next year, to lower our 2020 tax range by roughly 100 basis points to a range of 21.5% to 23.5%. Moving to capital return, through the first nine months of 2019, we've generated free cash flow of over $1.7 billion. We've returned over 90% of that cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, including $340 million of buybacks during the third quarter. We continue to expect capital return to grow as we grow, balanced against the need for incremental investments or M&A. Jeffrey Sprecher : Thank you, Scott, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'll begin on Slide 7. Since our inception, we pursued growth opportunities that leverage our leading technology and operational expertise. It's an approach that's guided our evolution into a number of adjacent markets and one that has positioned us today as one of the most diverse market infrastructure companies in the world, operating markets across major asset classes and geographies while serving an array of customer and industry participant needs. Our experience in building trading, clearing and settlement infrastructure informs us of the importance of analytics, indices, payments and valuation services. These are solutions that drive efficiencies, not proceeds that decline with our customers' headcounts. We made our first investments in these areas well over a decade ago, and we continue to build on that foundation, helping to facilitate workflow automation, enhancing pretrade decision-making and improving market transparency. Our third quarter performance demonstrated the value of such investments. Trading and clearing revenues grew 20% year-over-year, while recurring revenues in our data business, which represents nearly half our revenues, grew 5%, marking the 39th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. A number of years ago, we saw the importance of investing in an energy platform that is truly global. One that better serves the needs of an evolving and growing commercial customer base. Today, as trade dynamics evolve and become increasingly complex, customers are seeking not only liquidity in the major global benchmarks but also in products that provide for greater precision, particularly when coupled with comprehensive data and analytics. Our global oil complex spans over 600 products, including locational spreads, product spreads and refining spreads, products that are built off of our benchmark contracts, such as Brent crude oil and gas oil. And as the natural gas markets gained greater importance around the world, our customers are increasingly turning to our global platforms for their risk management needs. Operator : . The first question comes from Richard Repetto of Sandler O'Neill. Richard Repetto : So I guess the first question is on the data and listing segment. The ASV still is growing at that 5% clip, but I would say when you gave the guidance earlier on line-by-line, as far as pricing analytics and exchange data and desktops, et cetera, that the growth is sort of varying from what you gave initially. Scott, I guess, can you update us why that's changed? I guess, you could say some of the desktop connectivity, the Global Network has helped you but should we -- why the differences? And should we -- does it really make any difference, I guess. Scott Hill : It's a good question, Rich. And I think it's instructive. I forget when, but Jeff made a comment a couple of calls ago that effectively -- the business we bought four years ago, sold one product that's sold bond prices. And each year, it would raise prices a couple of percent, and it would hope that it could have the similar retention with customers. What we've built is what I think Jeff referred to as a data superstore, where it's not just bond prices, it's prices, it's reference data, it's fee, it's connectivity solutions, it's -- by the way feeds that are real-time prices, and now, we've launched our data vault, which will give you historic prices. And so more and more, what we're able to do with customers is sell beyond just bond prices and to go beyond just what this year's 2% to 3% price increase will be. And so I do think the focus shouldn't necessarily be on a single line and really should look more at the collective, because that's what we're selling. We're selling feeds, which is in exchange data. We're selling connectivity, which is in connectivity, and we're selling pricing and the reference data, which is in P&A. And just to kind of even it out, year-to-date, our growth in the data business has been 5%, pricing and analytics has been 5%, exchange data has been 6%, desktops and connectivity has been 6%. That's a pretty good balance, and it's because we have products and offerings that our customers need in each of those lines. And so did I think earlier in the year that pricing and analytics are going to be a little closer to 6%? I did, but I also didn't expect us to see quite the performance we have in connectivity. But again, we're selling what the customers want to buy, and I expect actually that the dynamics next year are going to be fairly similar. As I said, I think pricing and analytics growth is going to accelerate again into the fourth quarter. And I think it's positioned to grow 5%, 6% as we look into 2020. Connectivity, again, I think we're looking at a business next year that could generate another 4% or 5% growth on top of it. Exchange data is a little bit of a wildcard. If you think about our fourth quarter guidance, we got a bit of a drag, particularly related to the NYSE. So setting that wildcard aside, again, I think there's going to be a solid contribution from each of those businesses. And what we're focused on is a data business that grew 5% 3 years ago, grew 5% last year, going to grow 5% this year and is positioned to deliver the 4% to 6% model range that we've given again in 2020. Richard Repetto : Got it. That's helpful, Scott. And my follow-up would be, I guess, to Jeff, and Ben. But on the ETF Hub, we got it launched. And from what I understand right now, it's focused on equity, ETFs and just the, I believe, it's just the creation and redeem and maybe -- probably secondary trading, too. But I guess my question is, given what you've seen so far, how does that make you feel about the transfer when you try to get the create redeem in fixed income. I know you got BlackRock, and that certainly helps. But what can -- have we learned in just the few weeks that we've got it up, that it can be transferred over to not only that primary create redeem but the secondary trading in fixed income? Or is it just too early to tell? Benjamin Jackson : Thanks, Rich. It's Ben Jackson. Great question. And we're very excited about the controlled launch that we've had on the ETF Hub over the past couple of days of getting that up and off the ground with our partners as you highlighted. And our focus right now is really about building out the network. And the opportunity for both us and the customers is twofold. So -- and you touched on both areas. So first is the primary market. And when you think about the primary market, this is a completely underserved market today. There is not one independent provider of services that's providing a single marketplace, whereby multiple issuers can connect to multiple banks to really negotiate in both equities and fixed income, what is that acceptable basket of security. So for an equity ETF, what is that basket of single name equities that I need go out and procure in order to swap with an issuer, that basket of equity securities for a single share of an equity ETF. And in fixed income, it's acquiring a basket of bonds that, when acceptable to that issuer, can be swapped in our marketplace for a single share of a fixed income ETF. For us, this is what we're replacing is issue -- either issuer provided systems, which are very bespoke, each issuer has their own. Some issuers have multiple in different asset classes. A lot of this is done over the phone, spreadsheets, it's manual and it's very disconnected. And what we're introducing to the marketplace for the first time is a single marketplace, whereby, again, multiple issuers and banks can perform this whole negotiation process and then can consummate that swap of the basket of securities for the ETF trend, for the ETF share and then settle that transaction. So this is 100% greenfield opportunity, and the industry has embraced this. We have an advisory committee that's been a part of this, that consists of multiple big issuers as well as all the big banks and APs and market makers that are part of that. Our controlled launch is in equities, as you've mentioned, with BlackRock and several of the big APs and banks that were mentioned in a press release this past week, and we're going to be soon launching in the coming weeks fixed income. We feel really good about the network that we're starting to establish through the balance of 2019, it's going to be about continuing to build out that network and into 2020, around building out the functionality for multiple asset classes in that network in that primary trading environment. The second thing you touched on is secondary trading. So secondary trading, so this is downstream of the hub. And this is the actual procurement of equity. So when you think of procuring equities to go into the basket, you can go to a venue like the New York Stock Exchange. In fixed income, and you all know a lot of the usual suspects in the institutional space and in fixed income trading platforms like Bloomberg, market access and trade web, those are the entities that have historically been downstream in the procurement of bonds to go into that  that once assembled, those bonds would then go into our primary marketplace to swap for that individual share of a fixed income ETF. For the first time, our venues are going to be downstream of this ETF creation and redemption process, helping to provide another choice for customers, either through our central order book platform, our RFQ platform or our portfolio auction platform. And again, this is a space we haven't played in prior, and the integration efforts that Jeff mentioned in his commentary around our completed integration with Charles River, in our -- in the coming weeks will be completed with our integration with Aladdin all helps us to really establish and build out this network. So we feel great about it. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Carrier of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Carrier : Scott, maybe first one, just on expenses. So this quarter, a little bit better. You mentioned the onetime benefit, and even the fourth quarter looks pretty good. Just anything that's impacting the expense base on the synergy side? And then in an environment where we're seeing pretty healthy, like revenue growth, just wanted to get your view on some of the expense initiatives that you have in place, what we should be thinking about in terms of the incremental margin in the business? Scott Hill : Thanks, Mike. It's a good question, and it's the right time of year to be thinking about that as we get ready to take the Board our 2020 budget. I'm sure you all starting to pay attention to your 2020 model. So I think, look, within the expense base, I think the key thing is, and I said it in my prepared remarks, if you think about 2019 and look at where we're landing right now, we're actually landing in the middle of our original guidance, even though we've added about $50 million from Simplifile and the accounting change to move some of the net to gross revenues around our revenue share agreement. That's been mitigated by about $20 million of onetime items. That notwithstanding, we're still sitting right in the middle of that original guidance. So the expense performance has been good. We delivered on the last of the $30 million of synergies, but then we've additionally been able to mitigate another $15 million to $20 million of expense on our more recent acquisitions. And then in addition to that, just our normal expense management, which I think over the years, it has been demonstrated as a core competency of ours. And so as you start to think about next year, I think the model for next year is going to look a lot like it has the last couple of years, where we're going to reward our employees with a salary increase, consistent with what we've done in the past couple of years. We're going to have some expense growth that will be in support of revenue. You saw some of that. If you look at the tech line, for example, in the third quarter, that's reflective of good growth on the top line and some of the revenue share, which shows up in that line. So I think our overall expense performance this year has been very good, as you alluded to. And then I think as you think about 2020, if you look back at the way we've modeled and guided going into the last couple of years, it's going to look very similar. Specific to the investments, I think part of the good news is ETF Hub is launched. That investment's in our run rate. Bakkt, we're now a year through. I expect there'll be some acceleration in that investment as we move into next year. But again, largely in the run rate that we've got. And so a lot of the initiatives that you hear us talk about are in the expense run rates that we've shown you. And again, that's an expense run rate that's led to us actually doing better than what we thought we would be entering this year. Michael Carrier : Okay. That's helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up. There was a white paper out and some of the clients that use CCPs around, skin in the game again. Just more curious on your thoughts, if anything's changed or why this is coming up again in any new conversations with regulators, is anything is changing on that front? Scott Hill : Yes. So thanks for the question, and I'll put my clearing head on and take my CFO head off for a moment. So I think a couple of things. I think first of all, they're not a lot new in that paper. These are things we've been hearing for five years. Number two, it's a relatively small number of signatories. Big important names in a lot of places, important partners and customers, but a small fraction of the people that actually participate in our markets. In terms of timing, I think there was an industry conference that Jeff just flew back from, and so the timing is not surprising because it gives you a venue to talk about things that you've been saying for five years and aren't particularly sticking. But I think the important thing is dig into the substance of it, right? So they want us to put 20% of the guarantee fund as our skin in the game, which effectively is we'll fund the risk that they bring to the clearinghouse. Because remember, clearinghouses don't create risk, we manage risk. We don't take a long position. We take a long, and we take an offsetting short. We collateralize that with IM. By the way, IM that's based on models that a third-party validates, that a risk committee made up of clearing member approves, that a regulator approves and then an independent board approves. So the next time that I implement a risk model in one of our clearing houses with no oversight will be the first time and probably the last time for me in the job as well. So I think if you look at what's in the paper, we're very interested in a dialogue because, again, those are important partners and customers, but I do think that there's a little bit of a look over here and a request to try and mitigate some of the capital requirements on those firms versus a true view that there is some risk that needs to be managed. And so again, we're engaged in the dialogue. We are proactively taking steps to address some of the issues raised. But beyond being in the dialogue, I don't really expect it to move the needle. As I said, it's not particularly new, and it hasn't moved the needle in the last years. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Kenneth Worthington : Maybe first, can you talk about the penetration of the credit in muni markets and what sort of market share of those trading instruments you have done or what market share has done since your acquisitions of BondPoint and TMC? If shares increased, by about how much? And I know it's early in the implementation of your strategy as ETF Hub just turned on, but I'm sort of wondering about how the penetration of those markets is looking prior to some of your big initiatives getting underway. Benjamin Jackson : Ken, it's Ben. Thanks for the question. On the volumes front, so one of the things I mentioned on, I believe it was the prior call, is that our platforms, when you look at them retroactively, look at them backwards looking, they were historically concentrated in the municipal space. And if you look at just MSRB volumes, they've been very tough. The municipal space has been a very, very tough area for all-comers this year. And the good news is, we're actually outperforming MSRB. But again, it's been a tough market in the municipal space. The good news that we have seen on the platform is that the volumes, that while munis have been tough, we have seen treasuries really grow strong. As with munis falling out of favor, treasuries have come into favor. Now in the past year, a little over a year that we've owned both platforms, our focus has been on integrating the businesses and getting the businesses operating together, which we've completed. So they're now in a single business called ICE bonds for us. We've actually executed on a project over the past year to develop self-clearing to be able to create a more efficient clearing platform of bonds underneath these businesses, which will help us lower the cost of running the businesses. And the third thing that we've been doing is consolidating the broker dealers, and that will be taking place in the early part of next year, again, providing more efficiency to the operation of those businesses. In parallel to all that integration work, we have been heavily focused on the institutional initiatives underpinning these to really repurpose these businesses and to point them to where we see the real opportunity in the marketplace. And the things we've had to do is execute on building out our RFQ platform, which we've done, leveraging the expertise that we've had in the RFQ space in commodities for a number of years, and that represents 20% of our volumes. We've executed, as Jeff mentioned in his prepared remarks, on integrating to some of the big OMS platforms with CRD complete, with Charles River development complete and then Aladdin to be completed in the next couple of weeks. And we've also built out our portfolio auction capabilities, which, if you read any press articles, you can see that, that's an area that's been involved for both the buy-side and sell-side as a more efficient solution for executing trades. And to give you a sense on that portfolio auction side, we have, in a controlled launch type of manner, getting that portfolio auction off the ground. We've been partnering with asset managers, as asset managers are oftentimes benchmarked to one of our indices. So one of the indexes that we bought from the Bank of America Merrill Lynch, or they can be benchmarked to a third-party index. When benchmarked to a third-party index or ours, our pricing and reference data, more often than not, is underpinning those indices as well as those asset managers. As in the asset manager space, we have well north of three quarters of the asset managers around the world utilize our data to strike their NAVs and have done that for decades. The ability for us to combine for an asset manager, a portfolio auction to be able to trade all of their -- the entire basket that they're looking to rebalance against the portfolio in a single trade and then also give them the ability to price that, either at where our prices are that they've been using for decades or as a spread to those prices, it's a pretty powerful combination. And we saw in the third quarter in one of the portfolio auctions, to give you an example, in a single trade, a notional size of $275 million went off on that single portfolio auction trade. So this is something that we're looking to we've had some success with, and we're going to look to further engage with our customers in another area of growth. But again, on the execution side, what we see and our focus is on really building out our network, expanding our capabilities into the institutional space for execution, which is a space we've historically not been leveraging the strength that we have in our pricing, reference data and analytics businesses. Jeffrey Sprecher : Ken, this is Jeff. If I could just underline what Ben said is, we didn't have a natural nexus into the execution of bond securities. And so -- and there are some very good companies that are in that space, as you're aware. So we were late, if you will, to building out an execution venue. But as Ben mentioned, we admitted and recognized that we were late. And so we pivoted hard to build out all of the other things that we know tend to flow from having a good execution venue. And so we built out the data platform and are the predominant fixed income data provider now. And with $1 trillion of ETFs benchmarked against our indices now buying the MOVE volatility index, which is one of the major indices, buying the Bank of America, 5,000 indices that surround largely the fixed income space. We, in a way, leapfrogged where we would have otherwise been to have the back end and the ancillary benefits that we know come from having a strong execution venue. And so what Ben is working on is essentially levering off of that strong back end to move forward into the execution space, including, as he's talked extensively about, the ETF Hub, which is really at the root of where most demand is created for execution. Operator : The next question comes from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Daniel Fannon : Just wanted to talk about M&A and kind of capital return as you think about next year. And can you just talk about the landscape today in terms of kind of how active you are in terms of what you're looking at for potential M&A, if it's different than other periods? And obviously, this past 12 months has been heavily focused on buybacks, and is that kind of a reasonable base case as we think about 2020? Scott Hill : Yes, it's a good question. I think the simple short answer is our approach hasn't changed in terms of how we think about M&A, and it's how we approach it. Obviously, there are some interesting things that are going on in the landscape. But you've kind of seen over the last couple of years what our game plan is, and that is look at adjacent spaces where we think there's a market opportunity we can serve. A couple of years ago, it was buying the bond businesses, and Jeff just described the logic behind that strategy. More recently, we've been building a mortgage business and made some smaller acquisitions there. That's already $140 million run rate revenue business for us if you add Simplifile on a full year and with MERS. And the good news is, just linking over to your question about capital return, is we've been able to do those deals and grow our capital return. So we're going to end up returning over $2 billion this year, which is going to be around 20% more than we did last year, which was a record year, which was bigger than the year before that. We've returned it through share buybacks, but we've also grown the dividend consistently double digits every year since we've implemented it. And effectively, as I said in my prepared remarks, and as we've consistently said over the years, our strategy is to grow our capital returns as we grow, to return 100% of the cash we don't need in deals. And with the strength of our balance sheet, we've been able to do both effectively. We've been able to do deals and return capital. And so we continue to monitor the environment. We look for deals that can generate the types of returns that our shareholders expect from us that can help us grow earnings that are an appropriate strategic fit that help us effectively make marketplaces better. And to the extent we find those, we'll go execute on them because we've proven that we're good at it. To the extent we don't find the right opportunity at the moment, we'll return capital as we have. Jeffrey Sprecher : And I'll just mention that the market, the M&A market, the advisers and private equity firms and people that are at the core of transactions seem to like some of the deals that were done in our industry, where essentially, a company that was a public company that had a low multiple can move to a company that has a high multiple, and there'll be a multiple expansion. And same business, same company, different hands, different management team that the market likes better and you get a multiple expansion. And so we're being presented a lot of deals that -- because we have a good management team here, the people and a good multiple that many of you have helped reward us with, people are presenting deals that are simply multiple expansion deals. Those are interesting, but we have other metrics that we use, return on invested capital being one of them. Our ability to feel like, as a management team, we really could do something different than other management teams and/or that network provides some kind of acceleration of sales because of its unique distribution, those kinds of things that help us justify doing deals. But just pure multiple expansion or pure onetime gain, it just isn't the thing that we tend to look at because I'm not sure in the long run we would be rewarded. And I'm not sure in the long run this management team would leave a company for future management teams that would really be strong and have efficacy. Operator : . The next question comes from Alex Kramm of UBS. Alexander Kramm : Just a follow-up on ETF Hub, a couple of things, actually. On the one hand, I think you're talking about the authorized participants and market makers that you've been adding, but I think the one thing that's been absent is other issuers. So I think there may be some on the advisory council, but where were you in that? Because I think the idea is to really drive an industry solution and standardization. And then just a quick one for Scott also on ETF Hub, I know it's early, but I think there are some connectivity fees. And so maybe can you just talk about the near-term revenue impact? And in particular, whether it'll show up? I mean, is this going to be like data revenues, that's going to be accreting to? Benjamin Jackson : Alex, it's Ben. On the latter point that you brought up; I can hit it for Scott. But the focus in, and I commented on it and Jeff commented as well in his commentary, focus right now is really in building out that network. And in Jeff's prepared comments, he mentioned that BlackRock is a key development partner. We acknowledged and the industry acknowledged very early on that this is a pain point across the industry, across multiple issuers, because there is no single independent provider of services to really stitch this all together as a single marketplace, where banks and APs can very efficiently access multiple issuers through a single marketplace and through a single portal to execute their transactions. So we see this as we seen in any other marketplace, as a marketplace that when we partner closely with the industry and understand what the pain points are, that it's another one that we can help, provide some innovation to, provide some real efficiency to the marketplace. And as you mentioned, Alex, we do have other issuers. The other major issuers that you can think of are all on the advisory committee. BlackRock was the early adopter to this and pushed this early on, but those other issuers are in the weeds and in detail with us, pounding through the requirements, working through and going through demos of how everything works, giving us constant feedback on it. And as we expand this marketplace, not only in equities where we started, but in the coming weeks into fixed income. Fixed income is the area of the marketplace that has really the most inefficiency. And as we get that functionality out and released, we're optimistic that the other issuers and all the feedback they've been providing and all the time that they've been spending and helping us build this out will come on board. But it's going to take time, and this is a real sea change for the marketplace as we're replacing a whole bunch of very analog manual types of processes that requires a real business change. So it's going to take time to play out in 2019 and 2020 and for that network to build, but we feel great about the position we're in right now. Alexander Kramm : And Scott, do you have anything on the revenues? Will they show up? Scott Hill : I think that was reflected in Ben's answer. I think the financial impact of this is going to be felt beyond 2020, and next year is really more about building out the network. So I think that's where things stand with regards to 2020. Alexander Kramm : Fair enough. Just every little bit helps the data growth. So I just wanted to double check. Scott Hill : It does, indeed. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Just maybe back on the data revenue. And thanks, Scott, for that detailed outlook on the pricing analytics and desktops. Obviously, the exchange side is the wildcard. Maybe just if you can comment on what drove that down sequentially this quarter? And as we think about that going forward, obviously, the NYSE is the drag on that. Am I right in thinking that's around $50 million or so revenue pool that could fluctuate or have a headwind? Just to think of how much of a drag that could be on that 5% to 6% data revenue growth rate. And I just wanted to confirm, mortgage documentation, is that $35 million in the quarter based on your $140 million comment? Scott Hill : Yes. So I'll only give you a -- just a couple of data points on the exchange data. I said in my prepared remarks, in the third quarter that the 3% exchange data with 6% futures, and I didn't really say an NYSE number, but you can kind of do the math given they're balanced out. And if you kind of roll forward into the fourth quarter, and I've already seen a couple of notes that are kind of looking at the revenue guidance and where that will lead the growth, I said, we're going to accelerate growth in pricing and analytics. I said the connectivity growth is going to continue to be solid. And so again, in exchange data, it's going to be a story of futures, which is up 4% to 6%. And the average, it is probably close to flat, given the dynamics that we're seeing at the NYSE. And so when I say it's a wildcard, there is that issue. As I roll into next year, I don't expect it to be down. But I think Jeff said it the right way last time, it's not something that's really going to contribute to growth. It won't detract, but it won't contribute. Jeffrey Sprecher : Yes, there's an interesting dynamic at the NYSE that I don't think it's fairly covered by the press, and I don't mean the press is unfair. I just mean I don't think they understand the nuance of -- the SEC has taken a lot of actions around exchange pricing of the NYSE and its peers, competitors. The press tends to act, the articles tend to suggest that the exchanges won't be able to raise prices. I think what's failed to be understood is that the exchanges actually can't even lower prices, and the exchanges can't really offer new products or bundles or do any other actions, things are frozen. So we actually have an interest in lowering some prices because we think it will stimulate more demand. Our demand and growth of data around the NYSE is heavily driven by new products and new services and new bundles and new ways of looking at things, not straight price increases. And it's really been an expansion. I think we have over 40 data products, the connectivity and data products at the exchange that have been built over the last decade or so. And it's that business that causes it to grow. So as we think about budgeting for next year, we're just looking at a market where that it's likely frozen. And that's -- as you think about building your models, I mean, it's just that. And this is now the subject of litigation. Every single filing, the bank through SIFMA for years have been wanting to litigate. The exchanges are litigating back now, both within the SEC and in venues outside of the SEC. So there doesn't seem to be a quick resolution unless the industry wants to come together and figure out how to allow innovation around those products, which may or may not happen. There's certainly a lot of conversation going on around the data space. Operator : The next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein : I want to go back to data services for a second, and Scott, appreciate the more kind of holistic approach to the segment, but really wanted to zone in on pricing and analytics. I think, historically, this has been viewed as kind of the fastest growth engine within the segment, and it looks like the dynamics are slowing down a little bit. If you look at ASV, it's up 5% year-over-year. I think this time last year, it was going to be up 8%. So I guess, taking a step back and looking under the hood a little bit, what are you seeing that's slowing down that growth? And looking ahead, what products do you expect to perhaps contribute more to the growth from here? Scott Hill : Yes, it's a good question. Thanks. So I think the first thing I'd do just to put some numbers on the table because I can't help myself, we've grown our data business two years ago, last year, this year, 5%. And on average, pricing and analytics has grown closer to 5.5% on average over that same time period. So it has led the growth. And don't forget, that is the IDC business that used to grow 2% to 3%. And so we're growing it twice as fast, and it's because of all the dynamics I mentioned earlier that I won't repeat here. As we roll into next year, in a model -- data revenue model range on an organic basis of 4% to 6%, I mentioned, I think that business is closer to 6% next year. I said, we think we can grow overall 4% to 6%. I would say, again, pricing and analytics is going to lead the chart. I think that the dynamic that you're seeing in ASV simply reflects some of the sales activity we have, where, again, we've gone from a sales team that four years ago, had one tool in the kit, which was bond prices to a world where we have lots of tools in the kit. And so we may be willing to take a short-term trade off on bond prices if you'll buy more reference data from us, if you'll let us become your feed provider, if you'll buy our historic data through our data vault. And so that tends to flush through a little bit in a specific lines ASV. But overall, it's good for the bottom line of the business in the next quarter and more importantly, over the next year or two because it sustains high retention levels. It gives us more ability to resell, it gives us pricing opportunity down the road, and so that's why I answered Richard's question earlier the way I did, which is I don't think you should get too hung up on it. And I think last quarter, Ken asked a similar question, where I said I'm not too focused on whether ASP in a particular quarter is 6% or 5% or 7%, as long as the overall ASV is kind of in that 4% to 6% range, which it is, again, this quarter, as you can see in the appendix slide. So I think the dynamic in pricing and analytics is actually a healthy one because while we may not see the yield directly in that line, we're seeing it in the other lines and importantly, on the bottom line. Jeffrey Sprecher : And one other point I'd like to reiterate. I made a comment in my prepared remarks that we've tried to design this business so that it's not correlated to headcount in our customers. If you think about what we're doing, we've talked a lot to you all about the fact that we've got this amazing portfolio, and we like this notion of bundling. And so we are bundling enterprise solutions that are not headcount-oriented and it's why I think over time -- because we do see consolidation in the space. I mean we were an early consolidator of exchanges and execution venues, but we've seen brokers consolidate, high-frequency traders consolidate, asset managers consolidate. We've seen a broad consolidation across the financial services landscape as scale matters, as capital is looking for global alpha. And so we have redesigned the way we go to market, and it seems to be working for us. Operator : The next question comes from Owen Lau of Oppenheimer. Owen Lau : Questions related to Bakkt. One of your competitors launched a bitcoin futures in December 2017, and it will probably take them over two years after the launch of bitcoin futures to launch bitcoin options. What kind of feedback did you get from your customers to facilitate your potential launch of bitcoin futures, just two months after your launch of bitcoin futures? And also, it seems that Bakkt would also enter into the consumer payment space. What are the key characteristics of a digital asset that would be most likely become the digital currency in this space? Jeffrey Sprecher : Those are good questions. You've obviously been following along what we're doing there and looking between the margins. So really coming up with a regulated footprint for digital assets is something that is designed to attract traditional financial services players. Global retail customers have been very comfortable for whatever reason being early adopters on unregulated platforms that call themselves exchanges but really have no particular regulatory oversight, and it's not -- and lack transparency as to how consumer capital is being handled. And so we think there's an opportunity in what we're building out with Bakkt to bring that whole thing into a more transparent regulatory footprint and lend our expertise of regulation and trust, if you will, to these digital assets. The kind of institutions that are -- so first of all, all financial institutions are talking to us and looking at this and trying to figure out where this fits and what the global regulators are going to think about this and so on and so forth, so there's a tremendous amount of dialogue around it. But what you're seeing is the kinds of institutions that are coming into the space quickly that our institutional investors are new kinds of crypto hedge funds, crypto market makers. Many of these are players we know who have started an offshoot of their business to deal with digital assets. And the major banks are working with us, the major brokers are working with us, but still trying to figure out how this fits into their own ecosystem. And they know that when they do move into this space, it's got to be it's got to be regulated and approved by their own regulators. As we have been dealing with Bakkt backdrop, very quickly, people said that there's an active options market for bitcoin out there that is even less transparent in most cases than the cash market, and a lot of it is done OTC. It's OTC brokers and what have you, but there's a strong interest in having options. It just so happens that the way we've launched our bitcoin futures contract is that we are a source of price discovery because we're physically delivered. We're not dependent on the prices that come out of these unregulated cash markets. We develop our own settlement price, and so that it lends itself very nicely to an options market where people that trade options and hedge with the underlying can have perfect hedging in one venue that they know is transparent. So that was the pressure to get the options out quickly. On the payment side, we think that the digital asset space has largely been a speculative space that with speculators, speculating on the future value, the future efficacy, the future use cases of many of the digital tokens that exist. And we don't think that, that whole space will be relevant and grow unless there are real use cases. And we do, as you pointed out, I think that a use case is going to be the digital transfer of value through payments. And a bitcoin, which is where we have most of our focus is one digital token that could potentially be used for payments but has also, because of its mining capabilities and the way it's been developed, is really a store of value. Now I argue, I'm an old guy, and I argue to the younger people that work at Bakkt, and it's very much a younger workforce that's there, engineers that we've hired from many of the payment companies around the world. They view bitcoin as a digital gold. But I, because I'm old, I think of gold became a store value because at one point, it was a currency. We had gold coins, it was in circulation. And over time, because of the nature of its ability to spend that over time, it got hoarded and became a store value. And today, in a crisis, we all accept gold as a form of payment. And in fact, the very first product that we launched at Intercontinental Exchange in year 2000 was an overnight gold contract that was used interbank to settle differences between trading by sending actual gold receipts as opposed to currency. So I do think bitcoin will have an element of payments and as well as a store of value because it may well be that rather than convert bitcoin to fiat currency and then use fiat currency to buy goods and services that merchants and users will accept bitcoin directly, and you'll avoid the foreign exchange, if you will, the FX cost of converting back and forth the fiat. And so we are building out that digital platform, in one of -- we have probably 50 people dedicated to building out the infrastructure, and it's quite an exotic and unique thing that I think you'll see us rollout as we move into 2020, and we'll test the old guy's thesis here. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Sprecher for any closing remarks. Jeffrey Sprecher : Well, thank you, Andrew. I appreciate you moderating the panel, and thanks for everybody on the call. We'll look forward to updating you about our year-end results on the next one. Have a good day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please also note, today\u2019s event is being recorded. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Warren Gardiner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Warren Gardiner : Good morning. ICE\u2019s fourth quarter 2019 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Scott Hill : Thanks, Warren. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I will begin on slide four with some of the key highlights from our solid fourth quarter and record 2019 results. Fourth quarter net revenue totaled $1.3 billion driven by Trading and Clearing revenues of $626 million and Data and Listing s revenues of $672 million. Within Data and Listing s, Data Services revenues totaled $559 million, up 4% on a constant currency basis. For the full year, data services revenues grew 5% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted operating expenses totaled $570 million in the fourth quarter and adjusted earnings per share increased year-over-year to $0.95. For the full year, adjusted EPS were $3.88, up 8% versus 2018. We have grown adjusted EPS every single year since we first listed on the New York Stock Exchange 14 years ago. 2019 operating cash flows of $2.7 billion were up 5% versus 2018, yielding record free cash flow of $2.3 billion. Turning to slide five, you can see that we returned nearly 90% of that $2.3 billion to shareholders, 19% more than in the prior year. This record $2.1 billion of capital return was more than double, the amount we return the year prior to our acquisition of IDC in 2015. Jeff Sprecher : Thank you, Scott, and good morning to everyone on the call. Please turn to slide nine. 2019 marked our 14th consecutive year of record revenues and record adjusted earnings per share. It\u2019s a track record that reflects the quality of our strategy, and more importantly, the execution of that strategy. As growth opportunities emerge around the world, it\u2019s our technology, expertise and culture that enable us to quickly and efficiently capture these opportunities. It\u2019s an approach that empowers product innovation and it\u2019s a proven model that\u2019s yielded both consistent growth and shareholder value creation. In our natural gas markets, sale and production in North America is surging, while legacy LNG contracts across Asia are unwinding. Similar to the evolution of crude oil markets a number of years ago, the liberalization of natural gas is driving demand for a globally recognized benchmark. And our European Natural Gas complex led by our TTF contract is quickly emerging as the Brent of natural gas with average daily volume up over 100% in 2019 and up 56% on average annually over the last five years. As liberalization takes hold, what were once regional markets such as European TTF and our Japan, Korea marker called JKM, are becoming increasingly interconnected in global in nature and it\u2019s this evolution that drove record natural gas revenues up 16% year-over-year in 2019. In our oil markets, we have invested in building our global platform. Today, our oil complex spans over 600 products, including locational spreads, product spreads, refining spreads and products that are built-off our benchmark energy contracts, such as Brent Crude and Gas Oil. We continue to invest in our Energy business. During the fourth quarter, we announced the formation of ICE Futures Abu Dhabi, known as IFAD. In November, the Abu Dhabi Supreme Petroleum Council announced plans to lift designation restrictions on Murban crude, allowing barrels to move more freely and the price against our futures contract, which we plan to launch later this year subject to regulatory approval. Murban crude is a highly fungible and sought after grade of oil and it\u2019s utilized by a wide range of global customers, including over 60 refineries in the Asia-Pacific region. Operator : Thank you, sir.  Today\u2019s first question comes from Rich Repetto of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Rich Repetto : Yeah. Good morning, Jeff, Scott. So, first thank you for the remarks at the conclusion of the prepared remarks. I think, Jeff, everybody looks at you as the most innovative guy in the space, the true visionary in the exchange space at least I do anyway. But I think most of us got caught off guard by the media reports and I know you have made some of the connections just in the prepared remarks, but where I think this caught a little more attention than the normal is that the size of the transaction, the media saying it was over $30 billion, that being almost 60% of your market cap. So I guess the question is, can you say anything to that magnitude of a transaction? And then, maybe if it is true, then just go deeper into the connection that you saw it, and I know you did some of that in the prepared remarks? But why -- what do you see the value here in EBIT, what\u2019s the angle? Jeff Sprecher : Sure. Well, I want to be respectful to eBay, because they are not engaged with us and to a certain degree it\u2019s kind of like a question where you asked me we are standing out in front of my neighbors house and you say if you own that house, how would you redecorate their living room and I was raised to not do that and I also want to have a good relationship with my neighbor. So, I don\u2019t really want to talk about their business too much. But I guess, I was surprised that the market views, just the inquiry as being so unique. This company was for probably more than a decade run by Devon Winnick, who many people on this call know, because prior to that job, Devon ran and built a company that\u2019s now known as Refinitiv, which is a foreign exchange trading platform and a large data distribution network and a company that is now under acquisition by the London Stock Exchange of peer of ours in the industry. And as Devon advanced above the operation of the eBay marketplace to run all of eBay, he was replaced by a fellow known as Scott Cutler. Scott Cutler prior to that job was the right hand of Duncan Niederauer and worked for us at the New York Stock Exchange and now is running a exchange e-commerce platform, Unicorn known as StockX. So the idea that we would reach out to people who I know, who many of you on the phone know, to talk about whether or not there are parallels between their business and our business. I didn\u2019t think is particularly shocking in outrageous. But out of respect to the company, they have their own ideas and agendas and their new CEO, Scott Schenkel is dealing with a lot of activity in inbounds with Actavis in their stock and so I want to be respectful of him and the decisions that they are going to make on how they are going to run their business. But that being said, I think, Rich, in your world, you have the analysts that look at exchanges and data companies as a vertical and look at e-commerce platforms and technology companies as a vertical. And you think of those as being in two different atmospheres, in two different verticals. But for more than a decade, the Board of Directors of eBay, at least in my view as an engineer looked at their company largely as one that had more synergies and characteristics of what comes out of the exchange world, then the e-commerce world and I am not sure that it\u2019s been fair for the market to hold eBay accountable as an e-commerce company and compare it to the likes of Amazon. And whether or not it should be viewed as a 25-year old cash market for collectible goods, which looks a lot more like the New York Stock Exchange than Amazon and that curiosity and the fact that we know people there led us to open a dialog and that\u2019s kind of the end of the story. So, hopefully, that helps to characterize some of the confusion out there. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today comes from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Ken Worthington : Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Maybe, Scott, on the third quarter call, you said that pricing and analytics revenue and growth would approve again in 4Q on a workflow automation and shift to passive in fixed income. Revenue did grow, but just $1 million and growth fell sequentially from 3Q to 4Q from 5% constant currency to 4% constant currency and you -- again in your prepared remarks said that growth would improve throughout 2020. So maybe why did we see the growth rate fall in 4Q rather than rise? And help us get confidence that the trend will kind of reverse and improve throughout this year? Thanks. Scott Hill : Yeah. That\u2019s a great question, Ken, and a fair one, because I also said on the second quarter call that I thought the pricing and analytics business would see a stronger fourth quarter than we saw. Let me start with the good news. Number one, I think, the key metric that we look at is ASV and from an AVP standpoint, we entered the year with pricing and analytics at 5%. And I will come back to why I think that\u2019s going to get better, so that\u2019s an encouraging fact. Our growth in North America in Pricing And Analytics has been very solid around 5% to 6% for the last three years and we expect that will continue as we move into the year. Asia growth or growth in Asia, which I will admit is only 5% to 6% of the revenues, really took off last year. And it took off, because as we move through \u201818 and \u201819, we recognized that in a much more disaggregated market, an extended sales team was necessary and so we started to make those investments in \u201818, they don\u2019t immediately hit the ground running. But as we move through the back half of \u201819, we saw the productivity of that sales team really grow, the revenue growth really start to take-off and so the investments in \u201818, the hiring in \u201819 and the intent to continue to hire in \u201820, all of which is reflected in our expense guidance, gives us a lot of confidence that Asia growth will continue to accelerate as well. Europe is really where we saw the slowdown in 2019 and I think, there are couple of factors that are at play. One is, Europe is a fairly uncertain business environment right now and so we saw customers who had been doing a lot of work, getting ready for various regulatory changes in \u201818 and \u201817 before it really paused in \u201819, try and figure out what is Brexit going to mean to me? What are the next decisions I am going to make? If I am in the U.K. what rules and regulations, I am subject to? If I am in Europe, how might this change? If I have am both in U.K. and Europe, what changes might exist as well? So, we did see a bit of a pause with customers as we move through \u201819. Again, none of that was new, we were seeing it as we move through the year. In addition, we made some changes in Europe related to our pricing and billing to try and get the more of a global standard approach and we saw some impact from that, some customer confusion over some of those changes and that\u2019s really where I missed the call on the fourth quarter. We ended up having again some lower consumption in the fourth quarter and even some credits that we issue that impacted revenue negatively in the fourth quarter, that I just didn\u2019t see coming, not because I wasn\u2019t aware of the changes, but I just didn\u2019t anticipate the impact that we would see. Good news is that\u2019s behind us and as I said in my prepared remarks, a little bit of that challenge persist into the first quarter, but from there we think growth accelerates and then you ask the question, why should we be confident about that, the reason you ought to be confident about that is because just like we did in Asia, we have really been making a big investment in European sales force. We added 10% to the sales team last year, we are going to add another 16% this year again, all reflected in the expense guidance I gave you. Every one of those sales resources will immediately be positively productive, meaning they will generate more revenue than expense and the overall sales team will generate productivity around 6%, 7% this year. And so, investments in the sales team that we started last year, will continue this year and I am confident having been at recently the sales kick-off, that team is very motivated to turn the growth story around and with a lot of these customer challenges behind us, I am confident they can do it. The other thing that gives me a lot of confidence is Brexit behind us and now, customers are going to have to figure out, all right, now that I know Brexit is done, I have entered the world where I need to get back to work on making our business better and we think we have a lot of data offerings that can make our customers\u2019 businesses better. New products will play a big part. We have recently talked about and Jeff did in his prepared remarks, our ESG offering. As you know, Ken, ESG is far more mature in Europe and so customers will be looking at those products, I think in a positive way and I think that will generate growth in the back half of the year. And so if you take all those factors into consideration, I missed the fourth quarter and I missed it twice. But the challenges that resulted in the credits that lowered revenue in the fourth quarter again are behind us, the investments in the sales team, the new product innovation, the fact that Brexit is behind us, all that gives me confidence that Europe will rebound and as it does, in dollars and in growth terms, overall pricing and analytics will as well and I fully anticipate that we will see 5% to 6% growth in the pricing and analytics business in 2020, which again is consistent, that business has grown about 6% on average over the last three years and we think it will again this year. Operator : Our next question today comes from Alex Kramm of UBS. Please go ahead. Alex Kramm : Sorry to stay on the same topic, as Ken just now, on the data, you sound fairly optimistic, but your commentary was all about pricing analytics. If I look about at your overall guidance for data, I think you also commented on the last call to 4% to 6% overall for 2020. I don\u2019t want to stretch here too much, but I think we are going to calculate your guidance, I think 3.6 to 5.4 FX is helping you I think this year. So are you essentially taking that 2020, 4% to 6% off the table and it\u2019s more like, I don\u2019t know, 4% to 5% or where do we end up, so maybe a little bit more commentary about some of the other challenges or tough comps that you are facing in the other businesses, please? Scott Hill : Yes, it\u2019s a good question. This one though, I am going to take credit for having said it correct last quarter. What I mentioned last quarter, is that I was confident that the pricing and analytics business will grow 5% to 6%, I just reiterated that I said I thought we would see solid connectivity growth of around 4%, which again over the last three years on average is about what we have seen capacity, as I said, was up 14% last year, we anticipate it\u2019s going to be up 8% this year. I am very confident in that business and what I said is I thought if you added all that together without me saying anything about the exchange data business, we would be in the 4% to 6% range, and I mentioned consistent with our model. I think the math you did is exactly right. I think if you look at the midpoint of our guidance and where the street is right now, it aligns perfectly. The challenge that we have got on the exchange data side, we have seen softness related to the exchange data at NYSE and as you know from following the company as long as you have, on the exchange data side, we don\u2019t tend to see necessarily meaningful growth every single year, you know, every 18 to 24 months as we add product, as we find opportunities to capture value in our pricing, we do that. There\u2019s not a lot of price change that is coming through the exchange data side for the futures business in 2020 and so if you roll all that together, very strong performance in pricing and analytics as it rebounds from some of the challenges in Europe, I mentioned continued strong demand for capacity, which I have indicated to you, I believe, is the leading indicator just like open interest is for future revenue growth out in \u201821 and \u201822 and beyond, so solid performance in the connectivity business is capacity growth and the challenges in the exchange data space that I don\u2019t think would surprise any of you listening to the call. Jeff Sprecher : Alex, this is Jeff, let me just iterate on that last point because I have mentioned in prior calls, and I want to highlight again for you that at the Securities and Exchange Commission, there is a group of people that have tried to use the rule-making process to lower the fees for equity exchange data, it\u2019s had just the opposite impact which has paralyzed the exchange data pricing debate. You know, there are lawsuits going on rule makings, new filing, so on and so forth. This just sort of freezes time and will in my mind for a very long time going forward as lawsuits are litigated and appealed and what have you. So as Scott is putting a model together and as management is thinking about revenue opportunities there, we just basically say a kind of is going to be, what it\u2019s going to be, I don\u2019t expect it to go up, I don\u2019t expect to go down, it\u2019s really pretty frozen and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily the intent of the customers that have been trying to advocate for this, because it\u2019s frozen in a sense that we couldn\u2019t even lower prices if we wanted to and so, it\u2019s sort of is what it is and that\u2019s why Scott has mentioned, you know, you all follow this space, can see that. Operator : And our next question today comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Blostein : So, maybe go back to the M&A discussion for a second, so I guess this is the IDC deal, you know, ICE is really kind of focused on more bolt-on deals, to really sort of build on your core capabilities, whether it\u2019s trading, data, connectivity, et cetera, all deals is kind of on the smaller side. Your interest in eBay, albeit early, and you know implied potentially a wide range of things, but including maybe something larger. So, has anything changed and I guess, as we look forward should we anticipate a larger deals from ICE, in the future, including maybe in verticals that are not as obvious to us is what we have seen in the past? Scott Hill : It\u2019s a good question and you and I have spoken publicly about some of our philosophy to some of your clients, but let me just reiterate it for others. We have a great platform and you just look at this first quarter and where we are going, it is phenomenal, the legacy businesses that we have built and the efficiencies that we have plugged into that platform are going to deliver growth and so, you know, I look at my job and the job of the managers that are my colleagues sitting around this table and as we think about whether not we can create additional growth and alpha for investors, we have really landed and in two places that seem to work for this company. One is to buy smaller companies that are earlier in their life, where if we plug them into that platform that I just mentioned, we can accelerate their growth and we have done a number of things like that. If you look at our mortgage business. I think it\u2019s probably the fastest growing part of ICE. These were smaller younger companies that we have put together and put on a very, very efficient new platform that we have tweaked and built, and they are growing double-digits and I think we will continue to do that. I think this acquisition that we announced yesterday bridge to, I mean, you know, when we talk about thinking outside the box. I don\u2019t think any of our investors or peers have ever thought about whether or not you should be listening airline miles on an exchange, but these are the kinds of things that we are thinking about in terms of the second part of your question which is, are you looking at new verticals Jeff Sprecher : The other thing that generates good returns for our investor base is if we buy older larger mature companies, where we can do something and this was like IDC, like NYSE, where we can do something with our platform and technology that would take an otherwise business that may be declining and reinvigorated, and I mean, to a certain degree, and we really believe that by the way to a certain degree, we had a bit of audacity when we bought Interactive Data. We said if we buy this company, we think we can double its growth rate and we did and you should ask us why would you say that, you didn\u2019t even have a sales force in ICE. You didn\u2019t even have a billing platform that could send out an invoice for somebody that wanted to buy data and we were not in the fixed income space and that was a large fixed income platform and you know, what is the audacity of this management team at ICE to say you can buy this business and double it. And the reality is because we really believe in the underpinnings of our platform and this network distribution that we have and we took that company and within a year, we had dramatically improved its top-line growth, while eliminating tremendous cost by getting on the sufficient infrastructure that we have built around here. So, those two ends of the barbells, you know, larger companies, more complicated companies, that could use invigoration and smaller companies where we can improve their distribution tend to be how we best create values. Typically, as you know, Alex, most people come to us to talk about companies in the middle, you know, fully valued and might be really attractive businesses and they are and their businesses we would love to own, but they are at a point where they are doing fine on themselves and there is nothing that we could do that would invigorate them to a degree that would overcome any premium that we might have to pay and we are just not people that want to subject our investor base to those kinds of acquisitions because they tend to be red, black, that\u2019s in the long run and, you know, on either end of the barbell are pretty well sure things for us and we are in the luxurious position, where we don\u2019t have to do anything, because our platform is so strong as designed, that we have the luxury of having these bi-monthly meetings that you and I have talked about in the past to think outside the box. Operator : And our next question today comes from Kyle Voigt of KBW. Please go ahead. Kyle Voigt : Maybe just a question on the Bakkt. As you mentioned, you are planning to launch consumer app later this year. I guess what are you looking at to evaluate the success of the consumer app and maybe back more broadly. Is it just adoption rates at first and then how should investors really think about the revenue model over the medium-term, from kind of that the consumer-facing part of that business? Thanks, Jeff Sprecher : It\u2019s a good question and we set it up as a separate brand and we set it up as a company with separate investor pool. So that, we could have owned 100% of the company but we elected not to. Because it may have a different growth metric and valuation metric than our core business and that was intentional to give us flexibility at some point, we could pull it all in, at some point we could spend it all out, at some point we could bring in other partners and so we have a Capital Markets flexibility around the way we have organized, the name, the company, and set up the management and in fact we have them within our offices in a unique space that\u2019s key card controlled by them and so that it\u2019s truly allowed to operate within our ecosystem as a start-up. And in that regard, you know, the next big hurdle for the company will be getting that app into consumer hands and we will be looking at consumer adoption, more than revenue or expense. Fortunately, the company is not a particularly big drain on us and with Bridge2, Scott will update you in the next quarter about how the company looks, but we have a lot of financial flexibility now with the company, given that it has a revenue stream both from trading and from operation of all these rewards programs for 4500 companies. And so, I will be looking more towards consumer adoption. We also are engaged with, while we have talked about one consumer-oriented company on this call, we are engaged with a lot of consumer oriented companies and we have been very public about our engagement with Microsoft and how whether or not this platform can deal with digital game pieces and whether there is a market and a marketplace for digital gaming assets and that would fit nicely with other digital assets and so we are having a lot of conversations with larger consumer brands and merchants with some interesting ideas, now that we have got rewards and cryptocurrency and potentially gaming in one ecosystem and what else could plug into that and what are the synergies between various businesses. Is it a case that an airline would like to have a different rewards, relationship with certain kinds of partners, with certain kinds of consumers, is there consumer data that can be shared across a collection of retailers that view a common customer base, that can use that rewards programs and incentives in different ways, can more millennials be attracted to those companies by virtue of having cryptocurrency or gaming assets in that ecosystem, so the conversations that we are having across a broad range of industries really lead me to say, not so much revenue in bottom line, but it\u2019s broad adoption I think for 2020 that will be looking towards. Operator : And our next question today comes from Michael Carrier of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Carrier : Maybe one more on more capital allocation and M&A and Jeff, you provide a lot of commentary on strategy and how you think about new transactions which is helpful? And I guess maybe more on the financial aspect, when you are looking at areas that are may be newer or not as straightforward to like the core business, how do you guys think about maybe the potential opportunities, but maybe the potential risks when you are looking at things that aren\u2019t as straightforward and then the timing of maybe like the financial returns versus like those end-market deals, if you can just put some context around it, you know whether it\u2019s you, Jeff or Scott? Scott Hill : Yes, that\u2019s a great question and I really appreciate you asking that, because I think it\u2019s important. Jeff, I think very clearly stated that everything that has been discussed is very consistent with the same structure that we followed for 15 years, the biweekly meetings, the way we have thought strategically about the deal, the thoughts on how we use our platform, our management expertise to think about combinations. The financial approach is exactly the same, it\u2019s very good. In the summer of 2017, we walked you through precisely how we think about the M&A that we expect deals to generate returns on investment above 10%, that we expect synergies to largely be realized in the first three years, that we look for deals that deliver accretion and that\u2019s intentionally, you know, kind of third-down the list, because it\u2019s really that return on investment and the importance of it being above our cost, the capital and above our hurdle rate, that\u2019s really important. And that financial model, that financial discipline, it is how we approach every single deal, whether it\u2019s a bolt-on deal or a big deal, It\u2019s an obvious deal or a less obvious deal, the financial approach is exactly the same. Clearly to the extent that it is deal, that\u2019s a little bit-off the beaten path, it\u2019s really important to be able to get in and due diligence, and yes, we expect we can get synergies, but where might those synergies be and so the important elements of the model with deals that are again a little more off the beaten path, really are we need to go into and validate where we think the cost can come out, where we think the platform synergies will exist, but again the approach to it is no different, the same financial discipline, the same financial model and frankly the same financial hurdles that we have told you guide our capital allocation are exactly the ones we apply to every single deal regardless of the nature of that deal. Jeff Sprecher : And let me just give you, that was a quantitative answer, let me give you a qualitative point, that I hope doesn\u2019t get lost on our investor pool. This is a founder led company and I am surrounded by a management team that we have worked together for a very long time and we really know and I definitely know what this company is and isn\u2019t, like, you know, to a certain degree, I mean, we stitched it together, like I really know what we do well, but more importantly, I know what we don\u2019t do well. I know areas that we are really poor at and there is no illusion that somehow, we are going to magically get better at something and by the way, unless we decide we want to get that expertise, but generally speaking, we know the lane that creates value for us and we have used that same model over and over and over again, and there is no reason to deviate from that model and so when we think about, is there a marketplace for airline miles or swords and sickles that are on a video game, you know, we are not crazy, we didn\u2019t lose our minds. We know what our platform does and we know how to lever it and we feel really good about our ability to continue to find new asset classes and maybe more importantly for this investor group like mortgages, like fixed income create redeem, things that other management teams haven\u2019t touched, but the bolt-on well to our platform and so I just want to reassure everybody that the founders still here and the management team, that is I am a part of, is still together and we know we are, we know what we do and we didn\u2019t lose our minds over the weekend. Operator : Our next question today comes from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dan Fannon : Thanks. And I guess just one more on M&A and I appreciate all the commentary thus far, but, I guess just the current context of what you guys are looking at today and how different that might be than say a year ago in terms of your outlook and outreach towards M&A in the number and size of deals and I guess just based on what you have said today and outlined in terms of your track record, I guess point like why wouldn\u2019t eBay engage with you, given the success you have had previously? Scott Hill : Well, it\u2019s easy to ask the second part first, which is I don\u2019t know and I also mentioned that the first outreach to eBay was roughly 20 years ago. So, it\u2019s not one-touch, okay? so we think about things in the long run. By the way, when we bought the New York Stock Exchange, people were shocked and it came as a big surprise, my gosh, we have been talking to the New York Stock Exchange since we were a start-up. So, you know, to a certain degree opportunity has to present itself, timing has to present itself, both management teams feel like it\u2019s the right move, at the right time and you have to respect other people, as a public company, CEO. I am totally respectful that different managements have different agendas, and they have different struggles, and different opportunity sets and we can\u2019t see them and we don\u2019t know what they are. And so I would never be critical if somebody who wants to robust us because we were above people all the time, but we try to stay nice and close because you live long lives and you never know and here we are, you know, 20 years after I sat with Meg Whitman and the fact I asked Meg Whitman to be on my Board of Directors honestly and I ask for a lot of guidance from her and she is lovely and helpful and provided a real incentive and goal for us as a start-up. And so anyway, I think you should assume that we have - that we are not unique with this one leak that there are dozens and dozens of companies that we have had long time touches with that we could talk to and share ideas with that have gone on and will continue to go on. Operator : And our next question today comes from Ken Hill of Rosenblatt. Please go ahead. Ken Hill : I wanted to come back to Bakkt for a minute. You guys have talked about a lot about M&A, but I was wondering if you are considering any partnerships in that space with some of the traditional payment plans because loyalty program seems like a hot area. And I asked because a lot of the payment terms, I cover when they roll out new products, they are doing it over 10s of millions, 100s of millions of customers so could a partnership in that area help jumpstart some customer adoption for Bakkt? Jeff Sprecher : It\u2019s a very good question. If you look at the employee pool and the talent that we have recruited to Bakkt, there\u2019s a lot of people that have come from various payment companies and now people that have come from rewards companies once we close with Bridge2. And so we have a pretty good canvas in terms of having private dialogs with various companies and there is a lot of conversation going on. At that level, a lot of conversation with traditional banking and Wall Street, who are thinking about - what is the Fintech will look like for banking when we go to a zero commission stock trading environment for retail consumers, what - how is been tech going to change the broad financial services landscape and here\u2019s back then, it has a digital wallet with a lot of connectivity right now and what else can be done with it. So there is a tremendous number of conversations going on but importantly, we have built really an industrial scale platform there, that we have been working on now for well over a year with dozens and dozens and dozens of engineers that have built something that we know will scale because we are in a scale business that can hopefully look right out of the box as a company that doesn\u2019t look and feel like a traditional start-up in terms of its ability to deal with some traditional payments, people or banks or merchants, because I have talked to a lot of Fintech entrepreneurs and one of the things that a lot of people don\u2019t understand and rightly so and not to be critical, but financial services has a lot of rules and regulations around the world and we exist in that ecosystem and understand how we are going to be judged and monitored. And successful businesses need to scale and then that\u2019s not easy to do and a lot of younger entrepreneurs building Fintech don\u2019t fully recognize that when you are handling other people\u2019s money, you really need a very powerful ecosystem with internal audits and checks and balances and surrounded by a cyber-security overlay. So, and that\u2019s getting built-in, which gives us flexibility to talk to some of the kinds of companies that you are thinking of because I think it\u2019s going to be an attractive platform. Operator : And our next question today comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Maybe just continuing along that, Jeff these - your answers are really insightful here so really appreciate it. Just assuming given your conversation for eBay you are really talking about the marketplace component of eBay, but maybe more broadly what is it that you are - that the ICE platform and why is that uniquely positioned to leverage the consumer marketplace and then, maybe just talk about what are your ambitions longer term to move more into the consumer space versus the B2B space that ICE has always been - especially on financial customers? And then just a quick one for Scott, how much do you think you could raise the debt-to-EBITDA capacity if you are bringing on a more recurring revenue business versus just the ICE legacy business right now? Jeff Sprecher : So let me just say, again I don\u2019t want to comment on eBay and how they run their company or how we would help them run their company. Those are conversations that at some point, we would love to have with eBay management if they are open to it, but I don\u2019t really want to do that in public. But let me just say that, I will tell you that a large platform that we have, which is largely a database management platform doesn\u2019t really know whether or not the top high-frequency trading firm, that\u2019s using a liquid cooled computer and blasting bits and bytes off the  in order to interface with us. That\u2019s bit and byte is no different than our retiree sitting in their kitchen clicking on a mouse. Our ability to handle massive amounts of data securely, efficiently, put it in a database, sort it, search it, manipulate it, cleanse it and give it back out to people is a core talent that we have here, that is what ICE is. Just as an aside, I started the company by buying a little failing firm from MidAmerican Energy, which is Warren Buffett\u2019s electric utility and by the way I bought it right before he acquired MidAmerican. So he is a smarter investor than most of us on the call. But I bought this company it was called the Continental Power Exchange. I changed the name, I decided to call it Intercontinental because I thought being Continental was too limiting and I took the word Power out of it, because I thought just focusing on Power was too limiting. And so we end up with the name Intercontinental Exchange. I swear if I were starting this company today, I would probably call it the Intercontinental Massively Scalable Network and Database Company because that\u2019s what we are. That\u2019s what airline miles and gaming sorts and credit default swaps and delivering barges that we manage in Rotterdam for fuel oil, that\u2019s what happens, those endpoints are ubiquitous to that network in my mind. Scott Hill : And just to pick up on that for the more boring part of the question about financial capacity, not bits and bytes, or swords and sickles. I think the key thing I would tell you is our capacity for any deal really rest on I think three key factors. Number one, our commitment to do that by our investors, so the deal has the right return and to be able to present a good deal to the ratings agencies in the bondholders to borrow. And so we have to be able to do that. If we can tell the right story and demonstrate how it meets the needs of all of our important constituents that will generate capacity for us. The second thing is that the deal that we are talking about has to generate the cash to allow us to delever and to do so in a meaningfully fast way and we have done that historically, all of the times that we have decided to lever up, we have committed to lever back down within three years and in most cases, it\u2019s taken 18 months and not much more. And so that\u2019s the second thing, do you have a plan to delever, and by the way, do you have a track record of being able to delever. And so the relationships with our investors with bondholders are important, the ability and the track record of deleveraging important but then the third thing we spend an hour not talking about a volume business that\u2019s crushing at right now. We had some good questions earlier about a data business that is growing at twice the level of the large company we acquired a few years ago at over 50% margins. The combination of that business generates $3.3 billion of EBITDA. It generated last year, $2.3 billion of free cash flow. That\u2019s where capacity comes from. That\u2019s the starting point, it\u2019s the strength of the existing business, the fact that all of our colleagues aren\u2019t listening to this call, but they are running our exchanges, and are clearing houses, and selling data, and building ETF Hub and building a mortgage business, that\u2019s the foundation of capacity because if we don\u2019t have that $3 billion of EBITDA, if that EBITDA hadn\u2019t grown every single year for 14 years, we wouldn\u2019t be able to enter into a conversation about going and levering up. So it\u2019s those three things that drive it with the last one being the fundamentally most important one. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Sprecher for any closing remarks. Jeff Sprecher : Thank you, Rocco. Well, this was an interesting call and this management team will go away and think big thoughts and we will be back to share those with you next quarter, but meanwhile, as Scott said, please take a look at our volume and open interest and refine your models and see what\u2019s going on here, because we are very, very proud of where we are year-to-date. And we look forward to talking next quarter. Operator : Thank you, sir. Today\u2019s conference has now concluded and we thank you all for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note, that this event is being recorded. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Warren Gardiner, VP of Investor Relations. Go ahead. Warren Gardiner : Good morning. ICE\u2019s first quarter 2020 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Scott Hill : Thanks, Warren. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. Before we begin, we want to offer our hope that you your colleagues and your families are staying safe and remain healthy, during this unprecedented time. I'll begin this morning on Slide 4, with some of the key highlights from our record first quarter results. First Quarter net revenues totaled $1.6 billion up 23% year-over-year, driven by record trading and clearing revenues of $883 million and record data services revenues of $564 million. It's worth noting that this quarter started with January yielding what at the time was the best revenue month in our history. That record was nearly equal during February. While growing uncertainty related to COVID further increased our customers demand for price discovery and risk management in March. It is our customer focus and our investments in both sales resources and product innovation that generated the high-retention rate and growth in open interest, which lays the foundation for our record performance even prior to March, and which supports our ability to continue to grow once the impacts of COVID subside. Jeff Sprecher : Thank you, Scott, and good morning to everyone, on the call. Before I begin my remarks on Slide 7, I want to express our sincere hope that you and your families are safe and healthy. I'd also like to take a moment to thank my colleagues at ICE for the resilience and the dedication that they've exhibited over the last few months, and importantly, thank our customers, who now more than ever, put their trust in our people and our technology to manage their risk across asset classes around the world. Business continuity planning has always been paramount at ICE. Being prepared for managing risk is our business, and it's in our DNA. A number of years ago, we started building large scale remote capacity with a robust cyber overlay, so that our employees could work from home for extended periods of time. This meant equipping them with portable technologies, building secure virtual desktop environments, and being prepared to supply important equipment out of our own inventory. Operator :  Our first question is from Rich Repetto from Piper Sandler. Go ahead. Rich Repetto : Good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Scott. I guess my question, Jeff, is can we get your perspective or your views on the energy and the crude oil market right now, and the issues that are going on with the pricing? How do you expect Brent to price you know as the next contract expires and any color that you could give us a to educate us more on that marketplace? Jeff Sprecher : Sure, happy to Rich. Well, first of all, WTI, West Texas Intermediate crude oil, as many of you know as crude oil delivered in pipelines at Cushing, Oklahoma on a specific day, and there's local storage there. When there are pipeline problems or storage problems or problems on a specific day, that particular price discovery can reflect those problems. And that's what people believe have happened with the negative pricing at WTI earlier this month. But, I will say that we are aware that there are investigations going on to satisfy the market, the price discovery that happened on that day at that moment and that place, is truly representative. So, we look forward to the outcome of that. Brent is slightly different, and I'll explain a little bit at a high-level and then maybe ask Ben Jackson to help me augment some of the details. But there's a lot more cushion, if you will, built into the way Brent operates. First of all, it's a global contract. And so it's really looking at global capacity, global shipping capacity, global port capacity, global storage capacity, because the oil is seaborne. And as you know, I think Rich, it is a cash settled contract that settles against an index, that is an index that ICE generates itself by looking at what is considered the physical market called the Dated Brent market. And, we look at cargoes that are exchanged hands between major oil companies, these tend to be trades of a full cargo, ship cargo or a half a ship cargo that trade around the world, as the oil companies are trying to manage the delivery out of Deepwater Derrick, shipping availability, port availability and storage around the world. Those cargoes are traded to keep that whole physical infrastructure in check and balance. And those are the cargoes that we look at and create an index. If there are anomalies in trading, we have the right to question those anomalies and either ask for more information or disregard them or adjust them. So, there's human judgment that goes into that. And lastly, the Brent index, the Brent crude oil contract, the futures contract that we trade does not deliver on a day. It is a forward looking delivery period that has more cushion in it than we have at West Texas Intermediate crude oil. So, once long short, it's more global, it's more diversified, has more buffer and has human judgment in it, all of which can help alleviate some of the near-term stress that happens compared to WTI, where you have a moment in time and local infrastructure. In my mind, Richards, why WTI has always been a more speculative trader oriented contract, because people like to try to figure out those local issues and trade around them, and people with good judgment and good information can speculate around what's going on locally. Brent is a more global and more commercially used contract, because it's more closely reflects what's happening around the world. Ben, do you have anything that you'd like to augment? Ben Jackson : Sure, I can add a little more to that. And thanks for the question Rich. So, Jeff hit it very well around one of the core differences between the two contracts as one's global in nature, one's very local and landlocked. With WTI as Jeff said, there's well-publicized structural issues at Cushing. Infrastructure issues have happened in the past with pipeline and storage issues that create volatility in delivery. And as Jeff also said, the major difference between that and Brent is the Brent of waterborne contract, where it's much easier to low crude on the vessel and bring it anywhere in the world where there's demand and the economics makes sense. So you'll see a huge demand pool that you're servicing with the Brent contract, and you don't have those fundamental landlocked structural constraints on the contracts. The other difference has not talked about as much, and Jeff touched on this briefly, is that WTI is a spot month contract. It expires right when the delivery schedules at Cushing are being set. For example, the June contract expires on May 19, with only a couple days left of scheduling to happen on the Cushing infrastructure for deliveries. For the Brent contract, it's much more of a forward contract. So if you take that example of the June contract as well, that contract expires a full month before. And actually today is the expiration day of the Brent, June contract. So the full month between that and the contract is much less susceptible to issues that you'd see that can happen around infrastructure related issues or constraints that you'd see in a landlocked contract like WTI. The other big difference to just highlight quickly Rich is, because there was some misinformation put out there recently, around the concept of Dated Brent. And we give customers, yes, we give customers the choice of Dated Brent versus Brent to hedge. Dated Brent is a true spot month contract. So that price has cargoes all the way going up to the delivery month. Dated Brent versus Brent are two very different contracts, and there's a spread relationship that develops between those two contracts that does trade because they are very different. Dated Brent are spot contract. In that contract, we see that 85% of the open interest in that contract are professional, large commercials that are all over the delivery process that's happening in crude oil. So it's a heavily, heavily commercially oriented contract. And Brent, Dated Brent trade as a spread to one another just like WTI front month to WTI second month trade as a spread to one another. But I can say that Dated Brent, the Brent never blew out anywhere near to the degree that WTI did in the past week, where the spread between WTI front month to back month went from $58 to $59, and at that same period Dated Brent to Brent was around $5. It's these recent and past moves in WTI versus Brent, that have shown that WTI can be a riskier contract to risk manage. And that's why customers overwhelmingly select Brent to manage their risk. They also select Brent as really the basis and pricing mechanism to price all kinds of refined products, that we talk about oftentimes is one of the fastest growth areas of our business, which is our other oil complex. So these are refined products like gas oil, bunker fuels, jet fuels, gasoline, they all trade relative to Brent and they all trade in a global nature in areas around the world such as Europe, Asia, and North America and it's one of the fastest growing parts of our complex. This is why, if you look at the overall oil complex, our market share and overall oil from an open interest perspective is 64%, up from 55% just a couple of years ago. And in ADV terms, our market share is 56%, up from 45% in recent past. We're grateful that our customers are coming to us now more than ever to help manage their risk in this turbulent time. Operator : Our next question is from Alex Kramm from UBS. Go ahead. Alex Kramm : Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to shift gears to the data side little bit. I think you gave a decent amount of color already, but obviously, data guide unchanged. So Scott, or anybody else, would be very happy to hear a little bit more why you're so confident? And also what you've been seeing, I guess with sales teams displaced, working from home? And how you feel like that will change over the course of the year to still make your guidance? And then very quickly related to that, if you think going forward, I mean, the majority of that business is pricing analytics and fixed income. So with everything that we've seen here with everyone being displaced, I would just assume that it's going to get harder to get prices by calling dealers. So just curious, if you feel like this is actually an area of incremental demand coming out of this kind of crisis that nobody expected. Thank you. Ben Jackson : Yes. It's a good question, Alex. Thank you. Let me start with what I don't know. I don't know exactly, when the world goes back to work, whether that's second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter, early 2021. I don't think it'd be useful for you. I don't have an economist on staff to tell you that it could be fast or slow or anywhere in between. So, I don't have great visibility into exactly when things open up. But I have a lot of visibility into fact that give me confidence. So one of the things, I've got confidence based upon is I look at the pipeline and talk to Lynn and her sales team. And the pipeline remains really robust. And so the opportunity exists to sell into that pipeline and to generate revenue, that as we sit here today, we believe are consistent with the original data guide that we provided. I look at ASV that's up 4%. And if you do just the straight math on that ASV number, it lands you right on top of where we're guiding in the second quarter, and I think provides a firm foundation as we move into the third and fourth quarter. I listened to Lynn and our team talk about phone calls we got in the middle of the crisis from customers. We're thinking about or had moved away to one of the other competitors, and realized that the tracking error on the prices from those peers were significantly greater than the tracking error on our prices that are coming back to us. I know we were able to close a couple of key deals, but those deals didn't sign due to the work from home, which is not a loss revenue, it's just a delay, which I think can also help us in the back-half of the year. So in the very near-term, I see a lot of positives that give me confidence as we move into the back-half of the year. I think more importantly, the key thing, key message I'd like to get across is there's nothing that's happened in the last month or two or three that changed the medium to long-term prospects of this business, and our ability to generate 4% to 6% revenue growth. So, no matter what happens in the third or fourth quarter or early in the next year, this business is set up to grow well, for exactly the reason that you indicated. It is a business that provides mission critical information into the fixed income market. In fact, I've heard a number of our customers say, during the crisis price discovery in fixed income came from us. And I think that's going to be even more important as we get to the other side of this crisis. I think the demand for fixed income investment will continue to grow. I think the evolution of indices and ETFs will continue to generate demand on prices. And we're going to be there to serve it. And then the last data point that I would give you, that gives me confidence is we look back after 2000 and 2001, the IDC business grew greater than 4%. We look back after 2008, 2009, the IDC business grew greater than 4%. And that was when it was just prices. Today, its prices and reference data in fixed income and a strong network. And by the way, it's supplemented by a futures exchange business that between 2009 and 2012 also grew high-single digits coming out of the financial crisis. So, in the near-term, it's hard to call what exactly the numbers are going to be in the back-half, but I'd keep that in perspective as well. Because, even to the extent we're off a little bit we're talking about $0.02 to $0.03 a share on earnings well above $4, so it's something less than a 0.5% of earnings in the near-term. And a long-term model still positioned very well to grow 4% to 6%. Jeff Sprecher : Alex, this is Jeff. I'll give you one interesting -- interesting to me, at least, anecdotal piece of information that surprised me. And that was that our sales people in data have targets and budgets, as you can imagine. And our people in Asia were hit with work from home very early in the quarter, a lot of dislocation in our customer base in Asia. And yet we could see they were meeting or exceeding their sales targets. And so while, the sales call itself became very, very difficult on our people, the demand became very, very strong. And between that dislocation, our sales people and our customers figured out how to do business with one another and get things done. So we very early in the quarter felt pretty good about where we were heading before the lockdowns hit Europe and the U.S. And so I feel somewhat confident that our entire market is figuring out how to adjust to this -- I'll call it new normal of working from home. Operator : Our next question is from Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Go ahead. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. I guess, shifting back to the energy markets. I was wondering if you could kind of discuss the health of your customer base with oil at the current prices and talk about the commercial component in particular? And then just a point of clarification, because WTI is seaborne now, and just wondering if Brent, I mean they're facing the same supply issues at WTI is in the lack of demand. So just curious, you talked about the seaborne versus cash settled in some of the differences. But with WTI being now seaborne, does that alleviate some of that delta or variance between the two contracts? Ben Jackson : Thanks, Dan. This is Ben again. So on the latter part of your question there around WTI being seaborne, the reality is when you look in the physical market, when those barrels and when that oil hits the water, it's most often priced by a Brent, that's when it becomes Brent. So that's one of the major differences and it doesn't stop or prevent any of the issues that you see around, the infrastructure related issues around storage or pipeline capacity to get oil actually to the coast. So that's one. On the customer base itself, couple of quick comments on that. So on every earnings call, you've either heard Jeff, Scott or myself for many, many years, talk about that, since the inception of our futures business, we've really had the corporate commercial customer at the heart of our business. Those are customers that have real directional price risk. And whatever commodity is they're consuming or that they're producing in the physical markets. And what the futures markets are intended to do for them, as all of you know, is to hedge that risk if prices move against them, and to protect them in turbulent times. And we partnered with our customers very differently than others have and built out this suite. As Jeff mentioned in his prepared comments, hundreds and hundreds of oil products around the world. We have many, many different natural gas products around the world, power contracts around the world that help our customers hedge. So, we're grateful. What we can say right now is that we're grateful that our customers are coming to us now more than ever. The evidence is showing to help them manage their risk in these turbulent times. We saw open interest records in March. Open interest is the best sign of customers coming to you and showing that they're putting on positions for a period of time to manage their risks. In April, we\u2019ve seen it grow on a year-over-year basis as well. We're seeing open interest across natural gas, across oil, continuing to build in longer dated positions, which basically means positions that aren't for necessarily expiry next month, but positions that are going expire in December of this year or 2021 or 2022. And people that are tend to put on those longer dated positions are commercials that are in fact hedging their exposure to price risk. Commercials represent about 44% of the open interest in contracts like Brent. Also our Henry Hub contract's more than double our closest peer in their benchmark products that they have. The only thing I'd say is if you look at other evidence point I'd look at, is if you look at past times of stress, so you look at times when 09/11 happened, when the financial crisis hit, when Shell oil came exploding onto the scene. Brent ADV grew every single time in the 12 month period after that crisis hit, compared to the 12 month period prior to that crisis and open interest either held or grew. Now all that said, we're mindful that every day there's real stress in the marketplace that our customers are feeling. And the fact that they're coming to us more than ever to hedge their exposure to price risk in these volatile times is what our markets were fundamentally built for. And we're going to continue to partner and help our customers through this. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Carrier from Bank of America. Go ahead. Michael Carrier : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Scott, just a question on how you're looking at expense and capital management this backdrop. So on expenses, you actually give a range, how much of the base will flux to say like a quick return  versus a longer delay, and whether that's operationally or whether that's travel and those types of items. And then thinking on capital return, do you see any shift given the current backdrop? Thanks. Ben Jackson : So Michael, you were a little bit unclear in the question. I think what you were asking, the latter part was on capital return, which I'll touch on, and on the former part with expense management in the challenging environment. That's the question I'm going to answer. Hopefully, it's right. So, first of all, the way we're thinking about expense is it's consistent in terms of where we thought coming into the year. And the reason for that is we think it's really important to continue to invest in our business as we move through 2020. And the strong performance across our business allows us to continue to do that. It's important that we continue to invest in ETF hub.  Jeff talked about some of the milestones that we hit in that, it's important to continue to invest in building out our mortgage solutions. That's a business that when we bought it was $140 million revenue stream that now is on track to be $170 million plus. And you, I'm sure read the articles about the need for that business to automate beyond where it is today. So, we're going to continue to invest in that. We're going to continue to invest in the data sales team. We talked about growth in the European sales team and challenges in the fourth quarter. That business in Europe went from a decline in the fourth quarter to growth in the first quarter. And we continue to invest in the sales team, because when customers are ready to start taking the meetings, or as Jeff alluded to, if they want to do deals over the phone, we want to make sure that we've invested in the sales team that's necessary to deliver on that. And so our expense guidance is consistent, because we believe that this business is well-positioned to continue to grow this year and beyond. And it's important that we continue to feed the growth engine with the investments on the expense side. Now, having said that, you'll note that in our original guidance, we had $15 million to $25 million of expense efficiencies that we were counting on, and we will certainly deliver those. We absolutely do have flexibility if things get significantly worse as we move through the year. For a long time, a big part of our compensation system is paid for performance. And so to extent that the business performance starts to slow, we've got a natural break that happens on comp expense, which is half of our overall expense. But as we sit here today, Jeff alluded to, our employees did a phenomenally good job from home, delivering the markets, the risk management tools that our customers needed. And again, we're very confident in the future of this business and don't want to cut off the investments that are necessary to generate future growth. In terms of capital return, you know, we mentioned in the quarter that we spent -- our dividend grew 9% in the first quarter. We just announced our second quarter dividend, it's similar growth. That\u2019s a dividend that's grown double digits every year since we announced it back in 2013. And in addition to kind of what I'll call the run rate $400 million of buyback, we spent $300 million in addition. And I will tell you that the $300 million was spent in our open window in largely around the disconnect that happened around the eBay leak, earlier in the quarter, where once again, we felt like the market had completely mispriced our company. And we felt it was appropriate to opportunistically repurchase shares. That window ended before the COVID crisis really hit. But as we said, we bought it about $92 a share and those shares sit around $92. As we move forward, I think you should continue to expect us to return 100% of the capital that we don't need for M&A, that extra $300 million we spent in the first quarter. We still were at our leverage target. We'll obviously continue to monitor that as we move through the year. But given the strength of our cash flows, I would anticipate you'll see our routine 400 a quarter of share buybacks continue. You'll see the dividends continue at its current levels, which is growing year-over-year. And our overall approach is not different to capital returns. Last point, I'd make on capital, because I think it's important to note that within the first quarter, not only did we spend an extra $300 million on buyback, we also spent nearly $300 million helping back to acquire Bridge2 Solution, and yet our leverage was still at 2.3 times, which is a complete testament to the strength of the cash flows of this business. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Go ahead. Brian Bedell : Just a two part question, one, just to go back on the data side and some of the -- you know thanks for the color on a lot of the anecdotes there. Are you seeing any questions about price concessions as some companies struggle to reduce costs? And then unrelated to that on the energy side, if you can just remind us they're roughly, the rough portion of users that are commercial hedgers, within your mix versus financial players on the energy side? Jeff Sprecher : Yes. I got it. This is Jeff. On data what we're seeing is, the sale of the NYSE, U.S. equities tape is a very mature business, and not so much that there's pricing pressure. There's just consolidation I think in the way, at least, historically before this crisis, there had been ongoing consolidation in asset managers. And that really wasn't as much price as it was number of customers. But the rest of our business, we're seeing this huge demand and has really no price pressure on it, in the sense that there's a rotation away from desktop terminals, fixed terminals. As you can imagine, when you work from home, people are looking for lightweight, portable, easy to access, secure information and that's really a technology delivery issue that we are very good at, because of our investment in technology, because we're prepared to give you information in any form you want it, we've been able to move quickly to fill kind of this new need. I think we're demonstrating to a lot of people that, because we had so much capacity in our systems that on these extremely volatile days, our data was able to keep up and our analytics were able to deliver results, where we heard anecdotally that a number of our competitors that may have had lower prices or people that had moved to them for other reasons, wish that they hadn't done that. And we saw people come back to reengage with us, which was a very warming feeling for our sales teams. So, long story short, no, not a lot of price pressure. Much more about can I get the right information at the right place at the right time, and can I rely on it? And, that's what we're good at. Scott Hill : Right. And just before Ben picks up on that question, the only other thing I would add, as I mentioned earlier is, we're not just selling prices anymore. Now with customers that need the prices and the reference data and indices, and as Jeff alluded to, the connectivity. It's a full sale solution that we have. And so, it tends not to be as much about the price of any one element, but how well we can bundle that package together to meet their needs. Ben Jackson : And on the second part -- let me get the second part of the question that Brian had asked around mix. So in the comments that I made on the past couple of questions, I dropped in a couple of statistics there. But I think the key thing there to really frame your mind is that we are heavily commercially oriented, much more so than our closest peer. Both Brent, as well as our Henry Hub are two perfect examples. We're about 44% of the open interest is commercials. And when you do that same analysis WTI and Henry Hub at one of our peers, you're going to see that that's more than double what they have. So it's heavily commercially oriented. It's the commercial traders that we cater to and have really built our markets around. The second biggest segment of the marketplace would be swap dealers, banks that are selling structured products too and commercials. So you'll see that that is a lot of the trading activity and hedging activity that we see. I think one other interesting data point for you it's just Henry Hub alone. So, for one of the things that we've seen is with Shell oil production coming down in the U.S., well, oftentimes when Shell oil is being drilled, a byproduct of that is natural gas coming out of the ground in the U.S. And producers, you know, customers have acknowledged and seen that like gas production is starting to slow, and it's introduced some volatility into the basis markets in the U.S. But what we've seen is that customers are coming, very significantly to our basis markets as much as they ever have, where they manage 100% of their risk in the basis markets that we manage. And then secondly, they oftentimes trade not only the basis markets, but they put on longer dated Henry Hub positions, which is much more the longer dated positions, longer expiries is much more where the commercials play and manage their risk. And that has historically, since the inception of the company and starting our Henry Hub contract has been the part of the market that we have service. Because of those trends, we\u2019ve seen Henry Hub market share in open interest terms added 10 year high right now, with 46% market share in Henry Hub. So, we\u2019re seeing customers more than ever come to manage their exposure to price risk in our markets, which is what futures markets were built for. Operator : Our next question is from Ken Worthington from JP Morgan. Go ahead. Ken Worthington : Hi, thank you for taking my question. I'd love to continue the discussion on gas. The Dutch Gas business continues to do particularly well. Open interest has doubled year-over-year . What is the addressable market here, because that business continues to do exceptionally well and it's a high fee product? And in the resurgence of U.S. nat gas, again, the follow-up on your comments there. We've seen nat gas OI continued to build both in the futures and options side. Options activity got killed last year that's rebounded. And you mentioned, gas OI was at 10 year-highs. Why is that happening now? The Shell issue has been or opportunity has been going on for quite a while. And gas had sort of suffered while that business was growing, but we've seen a real resurgence. So anyway, could you further flush out your comments on the rebound we're seeing on the U.S. gas side? Ben Jackson : Sure. Thanks, Ken. This is Ben again. So one of the things we've been watching is with this pandemic, will that impact people's transition, and in particular in Europe and Asia to cleaner fuels and will that slow it down. And what we've seen is that it hasn't. I mean, as we've engaged with all of our commercials and commercial customers, and also the fact that the price of natural gas and LNG for example is low. We're seeing that transition to cleaner fuels is still really invoke in Europe and in Asia. And that's what led to the growth that you just referenced in TTF. And we continue to see tremendous growth in our JKM contract. There still is a decent amount of that market that trades in the OTC space. So there's a lot of runway to go still and bringing more of that business to futures. And more and more customers each month, as we look at the volume that's trading the OTC market versus futures. Customers are continuing to see the benefit of trading in the futures markets. And we're seeing that continue to shift and move more and more towards the future side of the business. In terms of -- on the natural gas side, what we're seeing there is very similar to what I said in a comment that I had just made. With natural gas we're seeing, with those the Shell oil wells starting to shut in and starting to slow production, you are seeing what was a massive glut of natural gas across the U.S. that depressed prices, and really had no volatility in the natural gas market, all of a sudden introduced some real volatility. And I know from talking with a lot of our commercial customers there. They're looking at trading more than ever, further out the curve, longer dated type positions. The natural gas basis markets continuing to grow and grow nicely in open interest terms. And the complimentary to trading in the basis markets is oftentimes people trade that as a spread to Henry, and trade them in a longer dated way. And historically, that has been the area of the market that we've played in. And that's why we're seeing the growth that we have, the robust growth that we have in Henry as well as basis. Jeff Sprecher : Ken, this is Jeff. One comment that I think you'll appreciate is, in Europe, you have the EMIR legislation, which is similar in scope to what the United States adopted after the financial crisis in our Dodd-Frank legislation. As you may know those U.S. and European legislators wanted more strength over the counter markets and move and push many market participants more towards clearing of swaps and derivatives positions. In Europe, there was a carve out that the utility business, if you will, and utilities did not have to clear OTC positions, they didn't have to margin each other. And so, to a certain degree, when Ben says the over the counter market is active in Europe, it's partly, because the futures market has to really earn its way, the trust of the market, because people do have to post margin in the futures business. So, for many, it can be more expensive. The reality is your counterparty is the clearinghouse which has a lot of transparency and safeguards around it regulatory oversight, as opposed to bilateral deals where you have less knowledge potentially of your counterparty. In times of stress like this, people pay attention to their counterparties. And so we again see this as another opportunity. We saw a similar kind of outcome after Enron's collapse, after the financial crisis collapse in 2008, 2009. And I suspect that you will us working hard to convince customers that we're a better -- European customers that we're a better place for them to keep their positions. So, there is opportunity always in times of change. Operator : Our next question is from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Go ahead. Alex Blostein : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to chat about your credit business for a second. So, I saw a couple days ago, you guys launched ICE-Select to consolidate access to a variety of liquidity platforms, obviously you guys purchased over the years. Can you talk a little bit about how that integration process is going? How are you guys marketing that to clients? Maybe give us an updated sense of what sort of the credit trading revenue for that whole business looks like. And whether or not this is a this is a point in time for ICE where we could see a more material acceleration and credit trading revenue? Thanks. Ben Jackson : Thanks, Alex. It's Ben. On the latter point around revenue, I think the way to think about our platforms and I've said this on our earnings call a couple of calls ago, is that the performance in terms of revenue that you'll see will be still very similar to what you'd see in the ATS volumes, that are reported from the consolidated tapes, less than 250, because the execution venues historically have been retail oriented. And where we've been focused is on building out our network and getting established, and getting as many touch points as we can into the institutional trading space to really start to penetrate that market. So, let me let me hit the first part of your question then. Our strategy has been to help industry participants, solve real strains in that secondary market, secondary trading market of just sourcing liquidity for bonds. It's been very difficult, especially in times of stress, and we saw this in the last couple of months to procure bonds, individual bonds, because it's still mostly analog, still a lot done heavily over the phone. So, our strategy has been to pull together our pricing or analytics capabilities and our execution technologies to create new innovations. And the first innovation, which we've talked about many times on this call is ETF Hub. And Jeff gave some statistics in his in his commentary. But we launched that platform with equities in the beginning of Q4 last year, fixed income in late Q4. And we've already had in a short period of time $200 billion in notional trade on that platform. In March alone, that accelerated to $87 billion. And out of that $87 billion, $63 billion of it was fixed income. When you think about $63 billion in fixed income in a month, in primary trading, that's a pretty good starting place of the market that trades electronically and on the phone. In the secondary market, where people are going to procure the bonds to gather the basket, and then they go to our primary trading offering to go ahead and swap that basket for a particular ETF share. So, we're seeing nice growth in the primary trading space. Jeff also mentioned that we have a new innovation that it just came out, with the ability to customize the basket of securities that are swapped for an ETF share. We believe this is important fundamental building block for us to further grow our community of APs and issuers that are on the platform. In parallel to that, so you saw the announcement yesterday that you referenced. So, we're very happy that with the announcement we were able to make yesterday, because what that in fact is, it's for the first time we've pulled together all of the liquidity on our various venues. So, acquisitions like TMC, BondPoint, and Creditex, we pull all that liquidity into one easy to use portal for customers to access. We've also combined the multiple protocols that we have. So everything from RFQ to auctions to click to trade, all into one interface. And last but not least, we've added on our institutional analytics as part of our data services business that serves the vast majority of the institutional investment community, with tools like best execution, and our real time pricing service called CEP. So now our customer can access in one portal a deep set of liquidity. You have choice of all of these different protocols. And you have institutional analytics to tell you what's the quality of my execution that I would get in these electronic liquidity pools. So where this starts to come together now, what our vision has been is that, between the primary trading order flow, so that $63 billion that I had mentioned, that we did in March, and our fully integrated businesses across ICE Data Services, as well as our ICE Bonds businesses through the ICE-Select portal that we announced yesterday, that now positions us for the first time to really compete for institutional flow that has traditionally done either in electronic form or still predominantly way over the phone for the first time. And because we're now in that position in the second-half of this year is when we're going to start publishing for all of you relevant metrics, the development of our network on the hub, as well as the development of our execution venues as they continue to mature. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back to Jeff Sprecher for closing remarks. Jeff Sprecher : Thank you, Kate. Well, we look forward to speaking to you about the company's current quarter on our next call. And I hope that in the meantime, that you and your loved one stay safe and stay very positive about the opportunities that lie ahead for all of us. And with that, I hope you have a great day.

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, that this event is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Warren Gardiner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Warren Gardiner : Good morning. ICE's second quarter 2020 earnings release and presentation can be found in the investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements which we undertake no obligation to update represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2019 Form 10-K, second quarter Form10-Q and other filings with the SEC. Scott Hill : Thanks, Warren. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our strong second quarter results. Net revenues totaled $1.4 billion, up 8%, driven by 13% growth in Trading and Clearing revenues and record data services revenues of $574 million, up 4% versus last year. This solid revenue performance combined with expenses at the low end of our guidance range helped deliver second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.07, up 14% over the prior year. We returned $564 million to shareholders during the quarter, including $400 million through share repurchases, and a nearly 10% increase in our dividend per share. Through the first half, we have returned over $1.4 billion to shareholders through both buybacks and dividends, an increase of 31% versus last year. As I mentioned, second quarter adjusted operating expenses of $575 million were at the low end of our guidance. COVID related impacts of the late IPOs, which reduce marketing spend at the NYSE. In addition, the high productivity of our technology team and reduce vacation due to COVID related travel restrictions drove higher capitalized labor expense during the second quarter. With a strong IPO pipeline and the reopening of many communities this summer, we expect these factors to begin to reverse in the third quarter, yielding an incremental $5 million to $7 million in expense. We also anticipate a modest ramp in strategic investments during the quarter, all of which is expected to result in third quarter adjusted operating expense in the range of $580 million to $590 million. Jeff Sprecher : Thank you, Scott, and good morning everyone on the call. Before I begin, I'd like to thank our customers who continue to turn to our global markets, data services and leading technology to navigate these unprecedented times. And I'd like to recognize my colleagues at ICE for their outstanding contribution to our first half results.  Now turning to Slide 7. Our records first half performance, which was highlighted by revenue growth of 15%, adjusted operating income growth of 19% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 25% is a testament to our asset class diversity, balanced mix of recurring and transaction based revenues, and ultimately the growth potential of our platform. In our first full quarter of operating in a work from home environment, I'm very pleased to say that our team's responded. Driven by our multiyear investment in both information and technology, our data services business delivered a remarkably strong performance. We generated key wins with our pricing and reference data, where the quality of our end of day and real time fixed income prices attracted both new customers and increased consumption from existing customers. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. . And our first question will come from Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Rich Repetto : I guess, thank you for going through all the details on the open interest, the energy open interest. And I guess my question was, I'm just trying to differentiate, why yours and I know you went from natural gas being very strong, but why you're opening for, say, as separated from your peers. And if you think I'm right when I'm saying as of yet it hasn't played out in volumes. And is that sort of the view that you have, but it will later? Or could you sort of explain that? And maybe I just don't have the right picture? Jeff Sprecher : Sure. What we've been doing over the last decade or so is really expanding the footprint of our energy futures markets. And obviously, we started when we acquired the international petroleum exchange of London that had four energy contracts, and today we have over 900, approaching 1,000. And so the growth that you're seeing is in the global markets, and it's in customers trading in these smaller niche contracts that give them more precision for hedging something locally or some product oriented to energy that is specific to their geography and business. And that\u2019s why I mentioned in my prepared remarks which is a third of our revenues now and energy come from these other energy products and they're the ones that are growing the fastest. They are correlated to the benchmarks, which is why it's important that we continue to market and push the main benchmarks, but the growth is in these other areas. And when energy markets are in contango, which for non-traders means the normal market conditions, where there is storage available in the world. We have always seen that open interest in these energy products is a good precursor to future volume trends. And actually, when the markets reverse and do what they call backwardate. This open interest becomes a four metrics. So one has to use open interest cautiously, but we see the opportunity for this business to continue to grow as customers come back to these open positions and manage them through the duration of their life. So it's a very bullish sentiment that we're using inside the company for our own forecasting. Scott Hill : And the only thing I'd add to that is don't get locked in the overall totals with some of the dynamics going on underneath, because a lot of what Jeff just talked about is growing right now. So our other oil products are up 15%, year-over-year in July. Our natural gas products are up 5% year-over-year in July. Our emissions products are up 21% year-over-year in July. And you know, looking at our website, those are higher RPC contracts. So not only do we have the mitigation and commercials on the platform, not only do we have the mitigation of the diversity across the products, but the growth right now as mitigation to some extent against the revenue impact that we'll see. And as you know, you can't spend volume, you can spend revenue. And that's where the cash capital returns and things like that are afforded. So it just, I'd encourage you the things that Jeff went through in his prepared remarks, take a look at how those businesses performing because they're growing right through this. Rich Repetto : Got it, and good great insight, especially on the you can\u2019t -- the volume translate into revenue. But anyway, my follow-up question, Jeff, was going to be on the ETF Hub. But I think your excitement in -- as you communicated, and talked about more of the -- just sort of the fact the sidetracked and diverted me let say. So I guess the question on mortgage services is that to the peers, right for digitization, automation, but there is a slight difference. I think from some of the markets, or maybe it isn't, maybe you can sort of draw the connection. With the other markets that you automated, there was certainly a matching engine, the exchange in trade and a massive platform here. It is maybe goes to the database management side of it. But it seems like you've just got some great tools that leverage this, potential for automation in this big market. But could you, I guess, draw -- give us a little bit more insight on the connection there? And maybe what the differences between that and say, the trading platforms that you've automated again and again? Jeff Sprecher : Sure. It's a good question coming from you Rich because I know you and I have talked in a number of public forums about the fact that you've seen ICE really focused on the settlement process in the markets that we serve. In 2007, we moved into clearing our own futures products. And I think that was pivotal moment in the history of the company and a light went on for me in the management team and the board that we really can do something for this back office workflow that is incredibly sticky. So you've now seen with the ETF Hub and the way we're approaching the fixed income markets, we entered through the back office with the reference data initially, and now moving into the ETF Hub, which is a settlement, essentially, infrastructure. And we're using the same playbook in mortgage which is let\u2019s get into the settlement workflow, and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks with MERS, right now, we touched almost all of the mortgages in the United States through what we've already built. And once you have that settlement scheme, it's easy to expand upstream and into the data business and into adjunct markets where that create value for customers that are very, very plugged into your network. And so think of what we're doing as, building the clearinghouse if you will for the mortgage industry. Operator : And the next question will come from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. ASV growth improves sequentially this quarter to 4.5%. It is still at the low end of the range you set forth when you guys announced the IDC deal. Are we on the path forward to the midpoint of your range or maybe even at the higher end of the range? The backdrop on the transition to fixed income indexation seems to be coming together quite well. You would have indicated, more new account wins. So it seems like things are getting better you indicated towards the -- improving as you move through the year. So, is the outlook here, or what is the outlook here over the next couple of years for ASV growth? Should we expect it to continue to improve from these levels? Scott Hill : Hey, Ken, its Scott. Thanks for the questions. Yes, look, I do think we certainly expect that our ASV growth will continue to accelerate as we move through the rest of this year. And by the way, I think in addition to the total ASV accelerating from the first quarter importantly pricing analytics, which is half the business move from three in the first quarter to four in the second quarter. And again, I expect that trend to continue as we move into the back half of the year. I said back in February, I thought price and analytics will grow 5% to 6%. I still think that's true for the year, which indicates I also think the revenue growth for price and analytics will accelerate in the back half versus the first half. And I think there are a number of trends that are really driving. And by the way, I've been given a shout out to Lynn and the team because they're leveraging those trends from home without travelling, without being able to go and meet customers face to face. And yet, we just had the best quarter of signings we've ever had. When it's told me she feels better about the pipeline entering the third quarter then she did entering the second quarter. And it goes to a lot of what Jeff was talking about. It's a flight back to quality on prices. We see customers consuming more of our prices. We see customers adding the names, adding our reference data because what we saw to the crisis is our prices were the De Facto price discovery. And in a world where you don't want tracking there, you've come to I say the services to buy those prices. That's what we're seeing. Our existing customers are buying more. We're seeing new customers join. Jeff talks about the index business, we now have $253 billion indexed against our indices, our fixed income indices. We went from single digits to nearly 20% share in that space in a very short period of time. And as Jeff said, that's still not $100 million business for us and it will be once. You look at the feeds business where that business didn't exist when we bought IDC five years later, it's approaching a $100 million in revenue and there we can compete not just on quality, but on price, because we're not protecting anything. We're going after new business, and we're seeing competitive wins, competitive wins against stable competitors and competitive wins against competitors that -- where customers aren't quite sure who owns them and who's controlling them at this point. So I think you're seeing all of those trends, a lot of that builds up in the quarter and allowed us to do a little better than the high end of our guide. It allowed me to mention in my prepared remarks that we're going to accelerate sequentially in the third quarter, and then again in the fourth quarter. And again, in a world where our sales team sitting at home, they're doing a fantastic job, and have allowed us to hold our guidance and to see acceleration in growth. So you're going to see it in revenue, you're going to see in ASV. And by the way, I feel very good about how it sets us up for 2021 as well. Ken Worthington : Great, thank you. And then we have some distance between the challenging April WTI delivery in negative prices for TI that resulted. Has there been any noticeable fallout and at this point, do you think ICE might see a benefit in Brent trading from where participants switching to Brent? Or has that transition already happens, over the last decade? Ben Jackson : Hi Ken, it\u2019s Ben Jackson. I'll take this one. So the short answer that question is yes. There is opportunity for Brent here and we're seeing it in a number of different areas. Jeff touched on one in some of his prepared remarks and in the first answer to Rich's question where I think that market participants have seen now firsthand a lot of the issues that can be created by that landlocked infrastructure on WTI versus the truly global demand pool that Brent has and can service. And what that's led to is not only growth in our Brent contract itself, but also in all of the refined products that come up with a barrel of oil, all the different locations where you can make and take delivery, which is very unique on our platform, where we have those hundreds and hundreds of different locations and refined products that customers can trade that are very deep and very liquid and are high growth opportunities for us. The other areas that we're seeing new opportunities for growth at Brent are for example, an ETF space. So we are having an unprecedented number of conversations now with ETF providers about having Brent for the first time. Another area we're exploring is retail demand. So retail in particular, in Asia, we're assessing what that opportunity is, but given some of the dislocations that happened in WTI, there are markets across Asia, that we're looking to expand and offer a retail offering for Brent. And then the third of the discussions around the Gulf Coast. So as I mentioned in Q&A in our last quarter, when oil hits the water coming out of the gulf, it price reference is most often Brent, so commercial customers are now engaging us more than ever around opportunities in the Gulf Coast around Houston related benchmarks and Gulf Coast related benchmarks. Bbecause Brent they see as the most logical benchmark to differentiate those contracts off of and create a differential market again. So we're engaged more than ever with commercial customers around what is that right, U.S. benchmark going forward and what changes may need to be made to them? So the short answer is yes, there's a lot of opportunity ahead of us and Brent. Operator : Our next question will come from Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead. Alex Kramm : Hey, good morning, everyone. Just wanted to follow-up on the mortgage discussion. Thanks for the detail here. I saw an industry poll in the mortgage industry the other day, that basically echo what you're saying in terms of digitization and the spending is going there that said, I think only 20% of that spend is going towards the closing portion, I think the majority is go to servicing and processing. And I think underwriting is a smaller part. So, first of all do you agree with that? It was an informal pull. But then if those other areas are getting more spending, how quickly can you expand from your base here? It doesn't have to be potentially inorganic, because, in terms of time to market? Ben Jackson : Thanks, Alex. It's Ben. I'll jump in on this one. So I think Jeff went through in his prepared remarks that focus on the closing and post-closing process? And a lot you answered some of the question in the way that you framed your question. In that, the post-closing and closing process is the one that's the most ripe for innovation right now. It's been the most manual laden part of the entire process. And with the two assets that we have been very unique with MERS that we've talked about a lot and that with Simplifile as Jeff mentioned in his prepared remarks having a very unique network and paved the road to all these different settlement agents and jurisdictions that no one else has, then that unique reference data set that we have. Puts us in a position for new growth opportunities that have a significant TAM, a billion dollar TAM across them. And to unpack how we're executing, how to think about that growth opportunity in front of us, and how easy it is and how now right in front of us it is, I'll give you a couple of examples. So first is with Simplifile, a key business be in e-record business. We've mentioned on calls that right now we're in jurisdictions and plugged into jurisdictions that represent 85% of the U.S. population. But in those jurisdictions, if you go back to 2019, we were only capturing on our e-record business about 25% of the eligible documents that we would take a pull on and we would get a fee on. You go to the first, accelerate to the first six months of this year and that has accelerated to 35%. So we've gone from 25% to 35% capture of what was manual and paper based documentation to now automated. A second example that we've talked about is e-notes. And Jeff mentioned this in his prepared remarks that we're doing about 3% of the MERS volume is now so when somebody's registering a mortgage, about 3% of those loans also include the registration of an e-note.  If you go back to last year, that was 1%. So we're seeing a nice pickup in acceleration there. And in addition to that, we're adding customers and have added customers like Ginnie Mae, Chase, Rocket, U.S. Bank onto this platform which gives us good visibility into a tailwind that will continue to grow that percentage. A third area of growth that we haven't talked about, is a business that Simplifile really builds organically by itself as a startup business. And that's the automation of the closing and post-closing process.  Think of this as very complimentary to what I just discussed that MERS has on e-notes and this is the automation of all the other elements of the closing and post-closed process. That business has gone from a start up to now if you use MERS volumes as a proxy during the first six months of this year, it's captured about 3% of that market. And we see similar to the e-note trend we're seeing adoption pick up significant customers onboarding onto that, and we have a very big TAM ahead of us there. The last thing I'd highlight is that while we have a bunch of other opportunities for growth in this market, the other thing that to look at is there's a very strong refi trend in the market, where each one of the services that we provide in every refinance that's done, we're collecting a transaction fee associated to each of those transactions. And if you look at where mortgage rates are -- if you look at where mortgage rates are now, there's an estimation from industry estimates that about 18.5 million outstanding mortgages are in the money at current rates. And in the money means they're 75 basis points lower than where rates are currently set. So we see ahead of us a significant refinancing boom, it's going to last for quite some time and with the Central Bank action that has happened, it's likely to continue in the years ahead. Operator : Our next question will come from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : That's a good takeaway then in to my question on fixed income and credit broadly. Obviously the mortgage side of that has fantastic tailwinds. Can you talk about the revenue efforts within fixed income trading? And tell me, if this is accurate. Sounds like you've got faster near-term growth trends on the mortgage side. And we have a little bit of a longer term build on the fixed income trading side. And then if you can flesh how you see the revenue in that area, growing in the second half and then into next year. I think ETF Hub obviously has got great momentum, but I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, but if we do not charging much for that right now. And there's a more of a promotional game plan on that. So maybe if you could just flesh that part out of that? Ben Jackson : So I think the way you characterize it is correct in terms of revenue. So with mortgage we obviously have had and have in front of us, near medium and long-term, a significant TAM to go after we're very well positioned to capture it and we're capturing it actively now. In fixed income, as I said, on the last few quarterly calls, what our play here has been on execution is to really establish a network for the first time, institutional network, leveraging the strengths that we have in our ICE data services business that has that institutional network, plugging into very inefficient workflows that are in the fixed income marketplace, and then combining our execution venues, our capabilities on the ICE data services side and plug it into these workflow inefficiencies to solve real world problems. And the first example of that, as we've talked about on calls is ETF Hub, and I gave a lot of great updates last quarter. A couple of things to look at in terms of network expansion and also volume expansion on that we've achieved this past quarter, because we've added our first three market makers onto the platform. So significant market makers like Jane Street, Old Mission, and Chicago Trading are now on the platform. Jeff mentioned in his remarks, we had two more AP significant ones in Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo that have joined the other five that are on the platform. We've added a new issuer as a development partner on the advisory committee in JP Morgan asset management. We continue to enhance our workflow automation capabilities in the custom basket facilitation or the ability to customize what are the securities that I can provide to somebody to swap for an ETF in that primary trading vehicle. And last but not least, volumes growth. So quarter-over-quarter our volume continues to grow in our primary trading venue. And we've done now over 330 billion in transactions since inception. What's ahead of us and getting to your question around execution, one of the key things ahead of us as I've mentioned on our last call that we just launched ICE Select and ICE Select is our aggregation venue of all of our protocols, all of our venues, as well as our rich ICE data services, data sets and analytics, like best execution and real time pricing. We've integrated all that into an aggregation venue, that in the coming weeks, it's going to be integrated into the ETF Hub. So for the first time, our venues will compete in the secondary market for flow to fulfill orders and procurement of bonds versus voice and other venues. And with the 330 billion that we've executed to date in the primary market, as a meaningful portion of the market that's out there for us to get started. Also ahead of us is really introducing for the first time our chat and instant messaging platform that's very well established in the energy and commodities markets, and introducing that for the first time into the fixed income markets. In late this year, we'll have international ETFs added on top of that. We will be in the latter part of the second half of this year, we will also start to share and publish on a regular basis volumes as our institutional network is starting to be established. Scott Hill : And Brian, the only thing I want to add onto that because it gets overlooked a little bit its -- we've got a CDS business that did $100 million in revenue in the first half of the year, which is 20% higher than it was a year ago on track to be a $200 million business. So that's another fact similar to my answer to Rich, that I hope people don't miss because in a world where people are looking to hedge their credit exposures, they can do it, with the bonds themselves, but they're also turning more and more to CDS. And we built to Jeff's point earlier about building clearing solutions and back end solutions that facilitate risk management. We did that and that CDS clearing business and its performance through the first six months has been outstanding. Operator : Our next question will come from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Sheriq Sumar : Hi, this is Sheriq filling in for Alex. You issued some long term debt in this quarter. Can you talk about the rationale for building up the little extra dry powder? And is there an opportunity to accelerate the share repurchase on the back of higher cash balances now? Scott Hill : Yea, so look, we did -- we have some bonds that were coming due later this year. And we also had through some of the M&A activity that we've done a rather accelerate are higher balance in CP. Looking at the debt markets and look at the interest rates that were available, we thought it was a good time to move into the market and to turn some of the CP out and to go ahead and take out the bonds. And if you look, we actually those bonds that were due in December of \u201920. We're actually going to cost us more from a coupon standpoint than the blended money we got that averages out at 20 years maturity. So our blended costs on what we raised is a weighted average maturity of 20 years, and a cost of about 2.5% to 2.6%. That was lower than what we were paying on bonds that we're doing it at the end of the year. So we thought that was an opportune moment to move, reducing the CP piece a little bit of flexibility for us in terms of the revolver capacity that we have. And in uncertain period that we're in having some additional flexibility is good and it was a relatively inexpensive app to go out and get it. In terms of the repurchases, you know what you saw on the quarter is we were steady. We said originally 2.4 billion authorization from the board roughly covers six quarters at about 400 a quarter. That's what we did this quarter. Get a little bit more in the first quarter when the share price was a little bit beaten down. And given where we sit today that was a good move. So I would again, as is typically my answer over the last few years is steady as she goes on capital returns. We continue to grow our profitability, we continue to grow our capital returns, we continue to grow our dividend. And we'll continue to look that -- look to do that. And we will continue to look to the debt markets opportunistically to continue. As I mentioned, again, in my prepared remarks, another thing I want people to make sure that you don't notice, our return on invested capital is now back at 10%. And our weighted average cost-of-debt is now about 5.5. So, the overall balance sheet management has reduced that costs even as the business has generated increasing returns. Operator : And our next question will come from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Carrier : Good morning. Thanks for the question. You guys have been making good traction and you've talked a lot about some of the viewers that I included in ETFs Hub and mortgages. Ben, I think you mentioned, a large ATM ahead, how are you thinking about that, as longer term revenue opportunity? What maybe ICE is focused on? And given the potential piece of trash that you're seeing and it seems like in a little bit faster than you would have expected? How do you see that maybe be plan out relative to expectations? Ben Jackson : Thanks, Mike. Similar to the answer I gave in the question a couple ago that Alex had. I think the way to think about it is that the real near-term revenue growth opportunities that are right in front of us that we're already capturing, is really in that mortgage services business and how well positioned we are for the automation of that closed and post closed process. Then especially with COVID, all the assets that we have went from nice to have assets to absolute must have assets. And we are onboarding customers at an unprecedented rate into our platforms for the registration of e-notes for getting onto Simplifile to plug into those more jurisdictions coming on board, more agents coming on board, and looking to rapidly, rapidly onboard onto these products and increasing adoption.  And as I mentioned, there's right in front of us, three to four significant growth opportunities that we're capitalizing on in terms of new business opportunities that we're capturing in that mortgage services business. For fixed income, we're establishing that network. It takes a while to get established into that institutional space for execution and all of the data points that I've been talking about on each of these calls, how fast we're getting this platform up the volume that's coming through the platform. How much of our network is already established. And as the network gets established, it really feeds on itself. So we think we're very well positioned there, for a medium to long term growth opportunity in execution. Remember in fixed income we don't look at it as just an execution business. To solve the real problems in fixed income it's going to require that billion dollar business a year that we have in fixed income that's really the cornerstone is our pricing our analytics business, and marrying those rich analytics and pricing services with execution and partnering with buy side and sell side clients to plug into real inefficient workflows because we're well positioned and that we're the only one that has really that comprehensive of all of the assets there to help solve them. Operator : Our next question will come from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Please go ahead. Kyle Voigt : Maybe question on M&A, you highlight in your prepared remarks the diversity of your business. Just wondering if where you still see holes? Or where you're seeing more opportunities to add to your broader portfolio still, whether that's a mortgage or consumer through back through elsewhere? And then maybe also on update on what you're seeing the current M&A environment in terms of more or less opportunities say versus a year ago? Jeff Sprecher : Sure. Well, I think it's a complicated environment. I had a very interesting conversation with one of the senior investment bankers in our space about the difficulty in two CEOs, meeting and getting to know each other and determining if their businesses would be good together where we're working from home and can't travel and can't have face to face conversation.  And so the M&A market as a result of that is much more about that we're seeing as much more about companies, particularly private equity owned companies that are going to run a process for their sale or merger. And in those kinds of situations, we are trying to be the most disciplined investor, Scott mentioned, we track our return on invested capital, we track our cost of capital. And so while it's easy to make M&A relatively easy to make M&A accretive due to the low interest rate environment that we're in, it's harder to make rational deals that have real long-term value creation for investors as opposed to giving our investors their money back and letting them make their own choices in the market. So it's complicated. That said, there are a lot of private equity owned businesses. So we've participated in a number of different, took a look at a number of different processes in the last quarter. And obviously, not done anything or we would have announced it. But I'm also seeing that COVID-19 environment has really created winners and losers in many spaces, including financial services. We have a lot of inquiries from in tech type companies that are worried about their future funding capabilities. These generally are companies that are loss making companies and built themselves to try to get scale in a world where there was a lot of capital freely floating around and now investors seem to be more disciplined and these companies are looking for larger sponsors, if you will, to both their businesses to. Again because we're disciplined investors and target things like accretion dilution return on invested capital.  Those deals are hard for us on a just purely financial basis. So we're only looking at things where we think those acquisitions would accelerate an initiative that we already are working on. And it's essentially a buy versus build strategy or a speed to market strategy. And those things are floating around, but again, and we've looked at a lot, but not seeing anything that really would move the needle for us. So long story short, we're in a very good position. We've got access to capital. We've got a lot of initiatives going on. Our productivity is high, because a lot of what we talked about on this call is about building, technology and systems to help our customers and interestingly, a tech focused firm can do well in this environment, because our people are actually being pretty productive, working from home. So we're in a great position. It's the right thing, where to come along. But it's a complicated environment for M&A just due to the social distancing that's going on. Operator : And our next question will come from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Owen Lau : Could you please give us more color on the progress of your partnership with MSCI? For example, the integration of ICE pricing and reference data into MSCI platform, and also the progress of launching more futures contracts based on MSCI index? Thanks. Ben Jackson : Thank you very much. This is Ben, Owen. Our partnership with MSCI is very strong. It's been a long standing relationship that we continue to look for opportunities to grow, and we're going to continue to engage with them actively on a number of different indices and a number of different futures that we can launch around the world. It's obviously been a very strong growth business for us for a long time with the futures in that business. We've seen a little bit in recent times, with the volatility and the risk that there is in the market, we've seen a bit of a pullback, on things like emerging markets when you're in a high risk environment people tend to pull back from the markets when they're -- when you have that kind of volatility in it. But we've seen a 15% increase in Q2 in this business and a lot of that is on the back of the IFA business, which is another significant contract that we have. So we're looking at them actively, partnering with them on all kinds of view new growth opportunities, and the real estate relationship is very strong. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Sprecher for any closing remarks. Please go ahead. Jeff Sprecher : Well, thank you, Chuck for moderating the call. And I want to thank everybody for joining us. We look forward to speaking with you again soon until that happens I hope that you and your loved ones stay safe and healthy. And that you guys try to have a good day. Thank you.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Intercontinental Exchange Third Quarter Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Mr. Gardiner, you may begin your conference. Warren Gardiner : Thank you. Good morning. ICE's third quarter 2020 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2019 Form 10-K, third quarter Form10-Q and other filings with the SEC. Scott Hill : Thanks, Warren. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with some year-to-date and third quarter highlights. Through the first nine months of 2020, we've generated record revenues, record adjusted operating income and record adjusted earnings per share, all of which have grown double-digit over a record year in 2019. This from business performance, allowed us to return $1.7 million of capital to our shareholders, 10% more than in the prior year and importantly, our solid financial position enabled us to invest $11 million to extend our mortgage network through the acquisition of Ellie Mae. For the third quarter, we generated earnings per share of $1.03 on net revenues of $1.4 billion. Data services revenue grew to a record $589 million an increase of 6% versus the prior year. Trading and Clearing revenues revenue totaled $711 million. Of note, our total mortgage revenue in the third quarter grew 62% on a pro forma basis versus third quarter a year ago, while ICE's total net revenues pro forma for Ellie Mae grew 7% year-over-year. Third quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $611 million including $29 million related to Ellie Mae. Total expenses would have been roughly $7 million higher if not for some credits we don\u2019t expect to repeat in subsequent quarters. As we move into the fourth quarter, we expect marketing expenses to accelerate related to a robust IPO pipeline and the launch of back mobile consumer finance app. Combined with a full quarter of Ellie, which we expect will contribute around $105 million to $110 million we expect fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses in the range of $695 million to $705 million. Jeff Sprecher : Thank you, Scott and good morning to everyone on the call. As I begin, I'd like to welcome the Ellie Mae team to their first ICE earnings call. While it's been less than two months since we closed on the acquisition in early September, I've been impressed by the collaboration between our teams during this short time and I am confident that the integration of Ellie Mae is off to a very strong start. I believe this is a testament to the talent of our respected employee population and our share of entrepreneurial cultures. Similar to our exchanges in fixed income businesses, Ellie Mae integrated into Ice Mortgage Technology as a network, a network that thrives by offering a value proposition that aligns growth with the efficiency gains that we bring to our customers. As we've seen across our network in futures, equity and fixed income, these efficiency gains are best achieved through harnessing unstructured data to create admission critical information, seamlessly linking participants to that information and ensuring that the network technology underpinnings are of the highest quality and security. It is the execution of this value proposition that often propels and analog to digital conversion of an industry and it's a blue print that we've applied across all of our businesses for over two decades. Turning now to Slide 7, open interest in our global energy business is currently up 9% year-over-year and with average daily volume in our flagship Brent crude oil contracts up 4% through September, energy revenues in total are up 15%. This growth further contributed to our average annual revenue growth of over 7% since 2015, growth is a direct result of staying close to our customers, understand their evolving essential needs, and expanding the breath of the content that we offer across our energy network. In our growth of natural gas markets, revenues were up 27% through the first nine months of 2020 led by continued growth of LNG and in particular, our European TTF natural gas benchmark, which continues to emerge as the Brent of natural gas. In addition, our environmental markets continue to grow with revenues up 12% year-to-date and up 7% in the third quarter. The globalization of natural gas and the growing adoption of environmental markets are trends that we began investing in over a decade ago. With our Brent crude oil contract serving as the cornerstone of our energy network, we've expanded the range of content that we offer to our customers and today as a result of organic and inorganic investments, trading on our network is not tied to any one product or any one region. Operator :  And our first question comes from the line of Rich Repetto of Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Rich Repetto : Good morning, Jeff and good morning, Scott. I guess given your acquisition to Ellie Mae, you got much more diverse business as you\u2019ve grown fixed income. And I guess on a some of the parts basis, the stock looks inexpensive to us anyway, so my questions are, why haven't you chosen to break it out? And I guess Scott did sort of address, you're still looking at how to report the segment results. But I guess more importantly, are you concerned over the valuation versus some of the parts? And how patient will you be over time? I know, you just acquired Ellie Mae, but how are you thinking about the some of the parts given your diversity here now? Jeff Sprecher : Thanks for the question, Rich. So the first thing we're thinking as Scott mentioned, and you alluded to, we're going to do a better job now of presentation so that you and our investors have visibility into how we're thinking about and running our business. Basically, as I think, you know since you've covered us for many years, we run network businesses, and we run businesses and look for opportunities where the next customer or the next product on that network becomes additive to everyone on the network and continues to compound revenue and earnings growth across that network as a result. And so we're feeling really good right now, if you look at our commodity business, futures business, open interest is up 9% year-over-year, when the markets are in contango, that's normally a signal or a precursor to volume and revenue growth in the future. So we're very, very happy with the way that business is performing. If you look at our fixed income and data business, you see that ASP, which is the future indicator of business is accelerating and compounding and as we\u2019ve indicated you, if you look at our new mortgage network, which we're still combining with our other assets, it's double-digit both in subscriptions and in transactions, revenue growth and earnings growth for us in those businesses. So all of the segments that we're going to be showing you beginning in the fourth quarter are well positioned for 2021. And the reason that, that I like to end my prepared remarks on this graph that shows the long-term earnings growth of the company is that that's how we're running it and as a result of that mentality, this management team has a mentality that our job is to deliver EPS growth where we normally found that the stock will catch up to that growth. And we appreciate that many of the competitors and futures are interest rate and financial oriented competitors and they're struggling due to the interest rate environment. Many people in the data space don't have the global footprint that we have to find growth around the world and many people that are in the mortgage space don't have the market share gains that we've been able to gain, including just in the two months, since we've acquired Ellie that has continued to accelerate that business. So we're all those networks are very well positioned relative their peer group. And I think that will become apparent over time as this management team delivers bottom line results. Scott Hill : And just interesting that price eventually catch up its value as demonstrated every share we've ever bought back in our repurchase program, a year later has been worth 20% more and two years later has been worth 40% to 50% more. And so it does catch up. I do think that the new segments will help. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we intend in early December to give you all some history with regards to how those segments will look back from 2018 and 2019, and year-to-date. So that you'll have that information early December. And as Jeff said, we'll present the company that way in the fourth quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm of UBS. Your line is open. Alex Kramm : Hey, good morning, everyone. Just I guess quick one on the mortgage side. First of all, I think Ellie came in better than your initial expectations. I know it's a small number. It was only a month but also 4Q looks pretty robust. So just curious about the near-term outlook. What are you seeing but related to that? I think the Mortgage Bankers Association recently revised their forecasts for activity for next year. So just curious if you're starting to get more comfortable or bullish on the outlook for next year that you've laid out? I know it's early days, but just curious about your latest thoughts? Ben Jackson : Hey Alex, it's Ben. I'll take that. So a couple of things I'll share with you. It's only been a couple of months since we've closed on the business. But a couple of interesting things to share with the group are number one, I'll share just on the integration front, we've made a ton of progress on pulling together our mortgage assets. So the Simplifile business, the merge business, and Ellie Mae we've been able to pull those businesses together to operate as one very, very quickly. And what enabled us to do that as we knew the Ellie Mae business very well, prior to doing this transaction, because we had a long-term partnership with them with Simplifile. So we had a good view on what we were going to do, we got to a room quickly in September, we were able to make the decisions that needed to be made to get the business organized currently, have made all those decisions announce them to all the boys and now we're executing against the single vision and single strategy. Two other evidence points I'll give you is so well publicized, that volumes are strong. Rates are low, Millennials are buying, you're seeing people purchasing new homes to get more space to get a pool transitioning out of cities into suburbs, we're seeing all that kind of mix. One of the interesting things that not many people appreciate around Ellie Mae is we also have a bit of a forward view on what's happening in that space, because we're in the origination space. And we see all the way upfront in the original application process when somebody is applying for a refinance, or for the purchase of a new home, we see that 60-plus days earlier than the rest of the market. So we see those trends, I could say from what we see on the platform, so that that volumetric aspect of the business continues to be strong. It just firms our view that we had going into this transaction, what the opportunity is with this business. The third thing I'd point to and the most important thing, and Jeff just touched on it and an answer that he just had. I think the most important thing to look at is our subscription sales results. So if you we modeled a view as to where sales of new Encompass seats would be, sales of their artificial intelligence engine called AIQ, that's going after the analytics TAM that we have identified in this space, we had a view of where subscription sales would end the year. And I can say that in the last couple of weeks, the business has already hit, the subscription sales numbers where we thought they would end the year. The reason that that's important is that as we're hitting those sales results, it helps to firm our view on what we assumed market share growth would be. So they're continuing to gain market share. They're continuing to gain more customers, more users, there's more recurring revenue coming onto the platform. It's a stronger network and all of this pulls through additional volume. So net-net is everything that we've seen in the two months of owning the business has really firmed our original views. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier of Bank of America. Your line is open. Mike Carrier : Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. At least one more on Ellie Mae, given that close and doing more work in the area, can you just provide maybe an update on when you think about the growth opportunities. And more importantly, apply the different components of the revenue growth, meaning you have obviously the volume component, but also the adoption and given the ladder, you kind of get more credit, in terms of valuation over time, it's still a little bit more important. And then any other factors or opportunities that you're seeing, as you do more work in that area of the market? Ben Jackson : Hi, Mike, it\u2019s Ben. I'll take this one as well. Thank you for your question. There's a whole bunch of different opportunities for growth in this business, which is what gave us conviction that this business can grow really through any volume environment that we see. And we touched, when we announced the deal on our ability to capture that $1 billion TAM in the closing and post closed space. So that's where we're tying together and creating any closing room for the underwriter to digitally connect to the settlement agents on the network that we have across mortgage. So I won't go into a lot more detail on that one. But I figured because we went into a lot last time, I go into a couple of others that we\u2019re capturing that I think are under appreciated. So first we\u2019ve identified that there's a $4 billion TAM in front of us in just origination and processing. And we're obviously very well positioned there, the businesses is touching almost 50% of U.S. mortgages that are coming through the process, refi and purchases. And as I just mentioned, the sales results that we've just seen has just firmed our view on the ability to continue to gain market share in that space. The second thing that that is in that origination and processing TAM is really about our network. And I don't know that people really appreciate that the fact that the business, our business here has the largest mortgage network in the U.S. So we interconnect 100s and 100s of service providers to lenders. And this network is very well established, all that connectivity exists. And there's significant benefits that the lenders themselves can receive from utilizing and buying services from those third-party providers over our network, yet, it's underutilized. So the types of benefits that lenders get from ordering services off of our network is that it's a very efficient process. If you're using the Encompass system, and you order third-party services, that ordering process is automated, because we know in the workflow when you're going to order a credit report, when you're going to order a flood report, all of that is automated. And more importantly, all of the content that comes from that third-party is digitally sent to you, so that you can consume it, you can easily move it around, you can analyze it, you can actually do things with it. The other way of ordering the services outside of the network is you'd have to manually go out and select vendors, you have to manually procure the information, you're going to get back scanned documents, PDFs, with data that you can't really do anything with, you have to have extra steps of manually rekeying information. So today, vendors are really starting to see the benefits of ordering services off of our network. And for the benefit that we're providing the lenders as well as the benefit that we're providing all these third-party data providers, we receive a revenue share for that. And we're seeing this part, this opportunity in front of us that we're starting to capture it and that part is accelerating substantially. The other piece that I'll touch on is the data and analytics side. And we've had a few questions since we announced this deal on this. And one I want to focus on is really analytics, and what we're executing against today here against another what we've identified as a $4 billion TAM. So we've identified that an average origination fee costs around $8,000. Of that time studies that we've done estimate that at least $5200 of that $8,000 is just manual processing and technology costs are well less than $500. In the year 2020, you'd think that that would almost be the reverse that manual processing would be a lot less and technology somewhat more. Our time studies have showed that at least half so call it $2,600 of that manual processing could and should be automated with simple tools to be able to analyze and take away a lot of the stare and compare work that happens. Well, this isn't just a dream, we're actually executing on this. This is a TAM that we're accomplishing and capturing what we talked about that AIQ business called Capsilon that Ellie Mae acquired in the last couple of years, this business goes through for customers today and captures documents, it recognizes the data on those documents extracted. And most importantly, we apply analyzers to that data, analyzers that today for our lenders can go through and automate the process, when you're looking at a credit report to make sure that the social security numbers match, the date of birth matches. The date of the credit report is within the window that the lender was expecting that credit report to be to approve the loan, the score that the individual had on that credit report matches the qualification criteria for the products that that consumer is applying for. All of this is happening today. And we're capturing, we're capturing this opportunity. And it's a significant growth opportunity in that data and analytics space. And we see it already coming through in terms of AIQ sales that that have happened this year on the platform and just in the last two months of owning the business, we're seeing these analyzers getting picked up from our existing customer base. So those are two new areas that I'd say to focus on going forward as other areas of growth for this business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington of JPMorgan, your line is open. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. It looks like we're seeing further pressure to migrate away from LIBOR in the U.S. Maybe first, can you remind us if there's any impact on this transition away from LIBOR in terms of data revenue, benchmark service revenue? I don't think there's much. But really, can you talk about the transition to SONIA, in terms of trading in Europe? And if there's any opportunities in this transition to either grow trading or grow data? Or should we really expect this just to be a swap from your LIBOR? Thanks. Jeff Sprecher : Yes, it's a good question. We're right, we're in the middle of a transition. So there's a bit of fog, if you will, as to the timing of this transition obviously, regulators are pushing. But there are a lot of underlying business issues that have to get dealt with in the transition. So it's hard to know, a final date other than the trend is there. The sale of LIBOR as an index for us is a de minimis revenue. And there is a question as to how long LIBOR may survive after the industry does move to SONIA in order to pick up legacy business that that just couldn't be transitioned over. So, LIBOR make this for some time. And it's hard to know what that time is, because it's so pervasive around the world. And there are many, there are other LIBORs by the way, where LIBOR being dollar LIBOR but there are a lot of other LIBORs made, which were the calculation agent all which have the same issues. The transition is actually trading SONIA has accelerated our market share is very strong, we're probably north of 70% market share of all the trading in SONIA and so the market is getting comfortable with simultaneously trading SONIA based futures and LIBOR based futures. And, so we feel very, very comfortable and confident with where we\u2019ve positioned our trading activities to be able to provide a bridge and if they two survive side by side for some time, we'll be a net beneficiary of that as well. Ken Worthington : But ultimately, it's a straight swap from one to the other. There's not anything of any way to really grow this -- grow from this transition? Jeff Sprecher : Well, the one area that is really under discussion is the small and mid-sized regional banks and a whole range of products that that are not necessarily covered by is the swaps or hedged with swaps. And so what you're seeing is that having worked with the industry to come up with a common rule set on how the transition can go and you see that sort of institutional market coming up with game plans, but in the small and widely dispersed market, they're not in the swaps business and they've got, there are many people that have 30 year agreements that that have the word LIBOR in it. And so, we have been developing an alternative to LIBOR called the Bank Yield Index, which we published, we've been publishing it weekly, and people have been doing, academics have been doing white papers on it, to see how it tracks a credit based on environment. And we've now accelerated the publishing of that daily to create more data points, by the way for analysis. And it's very possible that there could be a transition away from LIBOR or for the credit space, part of the industry that is not SONIA and if so we have a very, very good benchmark that we're working on, that'll be up to regulators, and in a broad industry adoption if that happens. But there certainly is a lot of work going on underneath to try to at least have a viable alternative, should that needs or need arise. Scott Hill : And Ken you\u2019ve seen historically, as you transition from one contract definition to a similar but different one, the impact tends to be as you near that transition point, you see a decline in the trading of the old and everyone's not quite moved into the new. And the good news for us is interest rates only make up about 4% of our revenue. So it's a relatively small impact regardless. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Campbell of Barclays, your line is open. Jeremy Campbell : Hey, thanks. Maybe just a follow-up to Mike's question little earlier around the mortgage TAM and the growth. Ben, you gave some really good color around the opportunity to capture TAM from your end-to-end suite of solutions now that Ellie's in the fold. Just wondering, as you guys look at your solutions right now, are there any additional whitespaces, you'd ideally like to fill in mortgage land either to build organically or bolt-on inorganically, that might make the holistic solution a little more compelling to the originator with whom you don't currently have a partnership or to augment the data and analytics product for LinkedIn to sell. There just seems to be some additional properties out there that could be available, but not sure if any of that fits within your vision? Ben Jackson : Thanks, Jeremy. And what I can say there is that we feel good about the position that we're at, with the assets that we have, I mean we literally our network touches every single part and aspect alone all the way from you as a consumer are thinking about it, you're going out and doing your research and touching the point of sale systems to engagement between that individual customer and the lender that they've chosen to do that loan with, the digitization of all the documents, and helping to automate that origination process, now interconnecting the originator to the settlement agent, and electronifying the close. So we have all the right pieces. As I mentioned, we focused very, very early on just making sure that we got the integration of these businesses mailed and executing on that. And we did very, very quickly to get the team all operating as one. And the other thing I'd point out is that a lot of the work we're talking about of pulling the networks together, of creating a digital the closing room, that didn't just start now. It started in the partnership that we forged with Ellie Mae back when we bought, Simplifile and Simplifile also had relationships with them that predated that. So a lot of this work is already underway. All that said, as I had mentioned in an answer earlier, I think it's underappreciated a little bit about how strong that network is that we have, having the largest network in the U.S., mortgage origination space. So with that position, we also see what our well the third-party vendors doing, what are the quality of the services that they provide. And we're in a unique position that if there is bolt-on opportunities that we think we can accelerate growth for entities by having them more directly part of our business as a bolt-on opportunity for us we would evaluate those. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dan Fannon : Hey, good morning. My question is on the data business, it came in above your guidance. You talked about some of the trends in your prepared remarks, Scott, but I was hoping you could kind of expand upon where the strength is coming from and you've historically talked about it on longer dated time periods in terms of the outlook. So maybe if you could give us a look into next year, how that business is trending? Scott Hill : Sure, thanks for the question, Dan. Yes. So look, the beat in the quarter was a couple of things clearly, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the SIP revenues related to the significant retail activity in the cash equities markets contributed to that. But the one that I've just been really happy with this year has been the pricing and analytics business, that's in a world where our sales team has been limited just like everyone else, in terms of travel ability to meet face to face, they're still crushing it, they've held productivity level versus the prior-year, they're on track to achieve I think it's like 98% or 99% of their signings objective. And that is what you'll remember I said will grow 5% to 6%, coming into the year, which is in February, before I even knew what COVID was is going to grow 5% this year, and the growth has accelerated each quarter. And it's going to grow again in the fourth quarter, and likely will be around 6% growth in the fourth quarter. So that business is doing phenomenally well. And it's a lot of factors, if people continue to consume more of our prices, as consolidation of vendors happens, we can be a one stop shop for people in their day to need, whether it's our data or feeds or network or all of that, we can sell. Our index business, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're now up to $270 billion worth of assets that track our largely fixed income indices. So it's that pricing and analytics business that I'm so happy within. And then you ask about 2021. And while I won't give you dollar guide, I will point you to an ASV that was 4%, two quarters ago and is above 5% now and will trend higher in the fourth quarter. And so to me, that's I mean again, as you know, today that's 90% of our future revenue as we roll into the new segment or view that ASV will tactically be 100% of the forward revenue. And so if you've got an ASV number today, that's sitting between 5% and 6%. That says you're set up very well to deliver that type of revenue growth next year. So we feel very good about the execution of that business, very good about how the sales team has performed. I also mentioned coming into the year the fact that we were hiring into the growth opportunities we saw and we've done that hiring. But in a world where people aren't in the office, getting those that part of the team up to speed has been more of a challenge. The good news, though is that means we've had a good year this year without really a lot of productivity from the new folks. And as we move into next year, they'll join us at the higher productivity levels, and I think can give us an added boost. So that business right now is hitting on all cylinders. And we feel very good about not just the fourth quarter but about 2021. Dan Fannon : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ari Ghosh of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Ari Ghosh : Hey, good morning, everyone. Ben, I guess just another one on the mortgage tech business (inaudible) color thus far. So the deal clearly makes a lot of sense as to growth profile, and structural tailwinds already seen really nice contributions from it from day one. But some of the larger competitors in the space have also been talking about the strength of the digital capabilities and the network effects of that basically as well. So we're just hoping you could talk a little bit about specific areas where you\u2019re the most differentiated versus some of the larger players, is it more on structured data side? Your digitization effort from the book flow or your network effects, which is something else such just looking to see areas you most differentiate? Ben Jackson : Sure, thank you for that. I'd say the major areas where we're different is I mean if you just look at industry assessments of market shares, and those market shares reflect the strength of the network that you have, the businesses that we have, have by far the largest network that stretches all the way from the inception of the origination, all the way through to closing. And I can't stress that enough but you need to think about that entire ecosystem from the inception of your thinking about loan, all the way through to documents get filed at a county courthouse to consummate a transaction between a buyer and the seller. So it's the strength of that network is first and foremost, one of the major differentiators that we have underneath that network, so not only on the origination side do we have by far a very big market lead in terms of the loans that we touch in the U.S. trending, getting up to a close to 50%, but also in the closing and post closed space with assets like Simplifile and MERS. Simplifile we've used the phrase that they went out and paved the road. So they went out and literally did the hard work of digitizing and digitally connecting thousands and thousands of counties around the U.S. to thousands and thousands of Attorneys that are in the middle of flash settlement agents that are in the middle of closing real estate transactions. The reason that Ellie Mae was such a strong network came and did a partnership with Simplifile, a few years ago is they acknowledged and realized that the piece of the network that Ellie Mae did not have, and the only entity that really had a digital highway, a digital network, to electronically close transactions was Simplifile. So that's a lot of the real differentiator, the other piece, I'd say is underneath the network, that's under appreciated the data sets that we have that are very unique within that business. So one of the things that Simplifile has by digitizing that network of all these settlement agents and all these counties, it is the only real repository in the U.S. that knows exactly what the settlement fees are, what the settlement requires, what the settlement requirements are for every real estate, just about every real estate transaction that happened in the U.S., with that type of information, you can use that information, pull it forward into the origination process and reduce a substantial amount of errors in the processing of loans by sharing that information very early on digitally sharing it. And then also including it with the analyzers that I was speaking about earlier, to be able to compare, what are the requirements that this county has on closing a particular transaction, versus what's getting pulled together and consummated in the origination package of that loan. So those are two of the main areas I would highlight as just substantial head starts in differentiators that we have that are very difficult for others to replicate. Jeff Sprecher : This is Jeff and one of the things that we really liked about business, when we started to think about putting together our network, our existing network, and the Ellie Mae network was that we've opened that network and so many of these companies that you may view as competitors use parts of our network in order to offer their services because our network is so comprehensive. And because it's open, and you can tick-off, you can join the network at the very beginning or all along the chain that we to a certain degree benefit from the entire growth of the industry, as partners, co-op petition, if you will, with many others in the industry. So that model is very compelling and that our goal is really, as I\u2019ve said on the final slide that we land on is to really just grow our earnings per share not necessarily to completely crush every competitor. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brian Bedell : Great, thanks. Good morning folks. Thanks for taking my questions. So just one quick cleanup on the tax rate outlook for 4Q, I don't know if I missed that one. But the bigger question is on another one on the mortgage business of course. Just I guess first of all, Scott if you can just reiterate the 8% to 10% growth on the Ellie Mae business, that you've stated in the past for 2021 even with the refi headwinds. And then I guess, more importantly and thinking about the organic growth of that business from obviously the large TAMs in the processing side, but also the organic growth from existing customers using the network? And how should we sort of think about those two different elements contributing, I do think using that organic growth data, or as you talk about this segment, and you carve it out into next year, that that would definitely be something that would be helpful for devaluation. So we could isolate that. And then the ability to scale that on that cost base that you've outlined for 4Q. So you think of 2021. What not to give expense guidance specifically right now on that but how should we think about scaling the growth of the mortgage business on that existing cost base? Scott Hill : Right, and so I think that was three questions. So the tax rate will be in the 22% to 24% guide. So that's been consistent for the year other than the third quarter as we had to revert the U.K. back to 19%. So we would expect the fourth quarter will go back to kind of where we started the year. Obviously, as we roll Ellie and that's a U.S. based business, that'll put upward pressure on the tax rate, and be subject to whatever happens in the Election. But even that, I think you're modeling, I don't see a reason right now to move away from the 22% to 24%. I'm going to do the expense first, I think one of the things we like about this mortgage business is similar to our other businesses, it is scalable in the sense of the incremental dollars generate good incremental margins that notwithstanding, we\u2019re in a place where we\u2019re making a number of investments. As Ben alluded to in his answers with regards to be building on an closing room as one really good example. And so if you're looking at the fourth quarter, I think you need to take a couple of things into account, if you want to use that as run rate. Number one, for purchase accounting, we have to rebuild the CapEx and cap labor. And so with that run rate, you should probably another 20 on top of that. And then I would throw the 20 to 25 of investments, we're going to be making to not only grow the business next year, but more importantly, two months ago on the deal call, we said we thought it was a business that could grow 8% to 10% per decade. And so we'll make some investments again, that notwithstanding you do that math, and you'll see that it will still be very accretive to the bottom line, I think in the fourth quarter alone, it's going to be 7% accretive. So that's kind of on the expense side. I don't know that today is the day we'd say a whole lot more in terms of our guide on the revenue line. I still feel good about the 8% to 10%, we do for all the reasons Ben alluded to, as we move forward. We mentioned going in that we expected the refi to go back someone in an earlier questions said that the industry assessments were improving, but they're really just improving closer to where we already were, that those estimates tend to be a little bit pessimistic. So, again, we're only two months away from closing the deal. And having the call with you all, Ben has given a lot of color on why we love this business and why we believe it absolutely was the right investment. And so as I sit here today, two months later, I'm absolutely 100% still confident that it can grow the way we've talked about. Operator :  Your next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Alex Blostein : Great, thanks. Good morning, everybody. Maybe shifting gears a little bit. I was hoping we can touch on your guys's credit trading business. I believe towards the end of the year, you guys talked about maybe some sort of a full integration between ETF Hub, and some of the training venues you've acquired? So maybe talk a little bit about what's the kind of overall revenue contribution from those businesses today? How do you think about that evolving over the next 12 months or so because I think you guys made some investments there over the last 12 months? Ben Jackson : Thanks, Alex. It's Ben. And as Scott had mentioned in the question earlier around the re-segmentation of the business that will comment in the first half of December, that's when we're going to start giving more color on the revenue aspect of this. One part of your question, on the other side of it, just to give you some flavor of continued strides that we're making on the institutional space, the strategy really has three legs to it. So first, is the automation of extremely complicated manual workflows in a space that's growing like crazy, which we've talked about a lot, which is that primary trading area of ETFs creation redemption, that's our ETF Hub project. The second leg of the strategy I talked about on our last earnings call was the launch of ICE Select and what ICE Select is, it's an aggregation engine that we've created to pull together all of our protocols. So the click to trade protocols, our auction protocols, and our RFQ protocols all into one and more importantly, it also added all of our institutional analytics and pricing content that on the buy side, all the sell side customers utilize today for understanding what the fair evaluation of the instruments are, that they're trading. And Scott had mentioned that as part of this realignment, we're really pulling together our execution venues in fixed income, very closely aligned to our fixed income data business under this. The last piece is we also, I also mentioned on the last earnings call that we've now connected ICE Select to ETF Hub and we've also connected ICE Select to third-party OMS systems, such as (inaudible). The progress that we've made since that last earnings call has been significant. So we've added another AP in Citigroup onto our ETF Hub network. We've added four more market makers, significant market makers, we now have a total of seven market makers in there that we just announced in the last couple of days. We now have six issuers that are part of our advisory committee on ETF Hub, so that the number of issuers are expanding that are helping to give us their requirements that we would need to cover to be able to add them onto the ETF Hub in addition to BlackRock. Hence we've had market makers not only testing, but now they're executing, going into the secondary market to procure bonds via ICE Select. In the last couple of weeks, we've had some market makers going and using our secondary platforms and ICE Select and go out and procure bonds, procure the baskets, then they negotiate in our primary trading menu being ETF Hub to swap that basket of bonds for share of an ETF. And the last bit of progress that we've made is that we have had multiple portfolio auctions executed on our platform by two of the largest issuers, two of the largest asset managers in the space in just past couple of weeks. So a lot of the last you've heard me talk on a number of these earnings calls, a lot of it's been putting all the infrastructure in place, laying a lot of all the rails and groundwork that needed to be done to pull this together is together and we're starting to see signs that some green shoots are starting to develop here. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Sprecher, I turn the call back over to you. Jeff Sprecher : Thank you, Andrea, for moderating and thank all of you for joining us this morning. We look forward to speaking to you again soon. And in the meantime, I guess I hope that you and your loved one stay safe and stay healthy. And with that, I hope to have a great day. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Intercontinental Exchange Fourth Quarter Conference Call. All line have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please note, this event is being recorded. Warren Gardiner : Good morning. ICE's fourth quarter 2020 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2020 Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including pro-forma revenues, adjusted income, EPS, operating income, operating margin, expenses, effective tax rate and debt-to-adjusted EBITDA. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You will find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP term in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful, as well as how management uses these measures in our Form 10-K. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses, and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, references to revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain terms. With us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Ben Jackson, our President. I'll now turn the call over to Scott. Scott Hill : Thanks, Warren. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4, with some key highlights from 2020, and a summary of our strong fourth quarter results. Earnings per share of $4.51 were up 16% year-over-year on record revenues of over $6 billion. Free cash flow totaled a record $2.4 billion, and we returned nearly $2 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. We also use some of that cash in our strong credit profile to make the important strategic acquisition of Ellie Mae in September, an acquisition that was nearly 3% accretive to our full-year 2020 earnings per share. Our fourth quarter results were an exclamation point on a great year. Earnings per share totaled $1.13, up 19% year-over-year. Net revenues totaled approximately $1.7 billion, a 14% increase on a pro-forma basis. While we've now transitioned to new segment reporting, I'll mention that fourth quarter data services revenues totaled $595 million, which was at the high end of our guidance range and up 6% year-over-year. For the full year, despite the challenges brought on by the pandemic, our data sales teams focused on serving our customers, deliver data services revenues that grew 5% over the prior year, and one of the top of our guidance entering the year. Benjamin Jackson : Thank you, Scott, and good morning to everyone on the call. Please turn to Slide 9, where I'll begin with some of the highlights and key initiatives across our Global Energy business. While inflation, economic growth and geopolitics will always influence volume trends in a particular quarter or year, we are focusing on investing in the structural growth opportunities that exists across Global Energy markets. Investments that have been critical to the 7% average annual revenue growth we have generated across our energy and environmental network over the last five years. Jeffrey Sprecher : Thank you, Ben, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 12. Over two years ago, and in collaboration with Starbucks and Microsoft, among others, we ceded a venture within ICE call Bakkt. Our vision was to leverage our collective core competencies to build a regulated ecosystem that would support the full lifecycle of a digital asset, and through efficiency gains and greater transparency, a platform that would have strong network effects within a nascent but rapidly growing asset class. Operator :  The first question comes from Rich Repetto of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Rich Repetto : Yes. Good morning, Jeff, Scott and Ben. Congrats on the great year. I guess, the question is on the recurring revenue. Thanks for the breakout and transparency on that, Scott. So I get the - I think the exchange you said at the SIP revenues, what I didn't understand is how - what's recurring in the mortgage side, and it looks like you're about - almost half year revenues recurring now overall if I have - calculated accurately? Scott Hill : Yes, Rich, you picked up on it exactly right. We did want to continue to give transparency in our guidance on those elements of our business that are recurring, and the leisure to predict in some of the volume based business. And you're exactly right that if you add up the total of the recurring guide, it's around mid-point, $830 million of revenue, which is just less than half of the overall business. If you look at -- we've given you that detail on a pro-forma basis historically, and if you do the math on the guide in the first quarter, those recurring revenues are growing 7% to 9%. So very strong performance on a very stable part of our business right out of the gate, obviously led by a strong performance in the mortgage business, which has picked up customers, picked up volume from existing customers, but then also the data business, which again, despite the pandemic, as I said in my remarks, sales team did a remarkable job and put us in a position where ASV was nearly 6% entering this year. So we feel very good about those recurring businesses and we intend to continue to give you each quarter our perspective on what we expect those revenues to be. You asked specifically about the recurring nature of mortgage bit, so I'll let Ben give you a little color on what's driving that great performance. Benjamin Jackson : Hi, Rich. We saw this. So the first thing to start with is on the mortgage side of the business. When someone subscribes to come onto our network, they're getting our full platform and our network services as part of that. So there is a base level of subscription fee that someone's paying to be a part of that and that's really what that recurring revenue piece is. And when we analyze the deal, one of the exciting things that we saw under the covers here and that I've talked about in terms of the different TAMs that we can go after here with this business, out of that $10 billion TAM, $4 billion alone is just in the origination side and automating that whole origination process. And we had seen that Ellie Mae had increased market share, 38% to 44%, in a pretty short period of time, and we had conviction that they're going to continue to grow market share in that space. I'm pleased to say that under the covers what we've seen in terms of sales performance and I even highlighted this on the last quarterly earnings call, back in October, that the sales results have been phenomenal in terms of selling new versions of our loan origination system into new customers and then also cross sales of our products into the customer base. And to go into that even a little bit further, in Q3 and Q4, the company set all-time records in terms of bookings on the Encompass Loan Origination System. So Q3 and Q4 are the two highest quarters ever in the company's history. Q4 across the entire Ellie Mae product set was the largest bookings quarter ever in the company's history. So all of that are real tailwinds. Scott gave the guide to the Q1 recurring revenue for the business as well and why we feel really strong about the businesses ability to grow that recurring revenue base regardless of volume environments. Operator : The next question is from Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead. Alex Kramm : Yes. Hey, thank you. Just to follow on that mortgage discussion just now since you gave some recurring revenue guidance, et cetera. Can you just give us an update how you feel about your outlook for the full year in general? It's two-part question. One, obviously, you gave a 8% to 10% outlook that you're comfortable for 2021 you said when you closed Ellie, but that was just flatly and now you're obviously running ahead. So, one, how should we be thinking about that guidance going forward now and how should we really hold you accountable now that you obviously talking about pro forma numbers, you're integrating the business, so how should we think about it from a combined ICE plus Ellie mortgage outlook for the year? Thanks. Benjamin Jackson : Thanks, Alex. It's Ben. So obviously, fourth quarter blew away all industry estimates in terms of volume. So you got to set that aside. And when we did this deal, we are very clear that we saw this as a long-term growth trend and that we are convinced that on an annual basis, we can grow this business and this business will grow 8% to 10% per year on average over 10 years. And underneath the covers, as I just referenced in the answer I gave to Rich, if you look under the covers of what's happened with that business since we've acquired it, sales strength has been very strong. So I mentioned a couple of the Encompass records that we saw over the last couple of quarters. Also another in that, $4 billion of the $10 billion TAM, another $4 billion of that $10 billion TAM is around data and analytics. And we also saw record sales of our AIQ platform, so record bookings of the analyzers that are automating that origination workflow in the fourth quarter. We continue to see strength across Encompass as well as AIQ in January, and we're ahead in January than where we thought we were going to be in terms of our model. What this means is that, as we're hitting these types of sales results and sales records for the company, it obviously means there's going to be more recurring revenue into the business. It means it's going to be more customers on the business. There's going to be more loans that are on the platforms that are now on our network loans that we did not interact with before. And more loans on our network interact with the third parties on the network that we have and for the efficiencies that we provide to people, ordering services like our flood report or credit report of that network, we monetize that, charge a service fee for the efficiency that we're providing. So all of these we see as significant tailwinds into the business that gives us confidence that we can grow regardless of volume environment over a long period of time with that 8% to 10% guidance. Operator : The next question is from Mike Carrier of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Mike Carrier : Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to get an update on the data outlook. And I guess, mostly on the equity side, you've just given some of the changes with the SEC on the data rule. Just wanted to see how you think about if that can impact the business, how you guys are thinking about it? Whether it's from a product standpoint, new competition coming in to the industry, I mean, how you are, let's say, to navigate? Scott Hill : Hey, Mike. It's Scott, I'll take this, and then if Jeff wants to jump in, he can. I think your question as I understood it was looking at kind of the recurring revenues in the Exchange business, specifically exchange data, what are our expectations in terms of any revenue impact from ongoing dialog with the SEC, and the answer is none. We're in conversations about changes they discuss, but right now, we haven't seen any impact. We don't anticipate any impact. Yes, I'll tell you what I think is consistent with what we've said for probably the last two or three years, which is -- that's not a line we expect to generate a lot of growth worth, not a line that we expect going to go down much, it's just kind of be stable. And again, we've given you some history on the recurring revenue. And if you look 3Q, 4Q, the guide to 1Q that they're all, kind of, right in that same number. So there is no expectation on our end that there are any changes that are likely to impact revenue this year. We've also said in the past and I think it's still true at any changes that did come or will likely come in over the course of two, three, five years, not immediately. So the net-net answer is, no real impact expected on that bucket of revenue for us this year. Operator : The next question is from Ken Hill of Loop Capital. Please go ahead. Ken Hill : Hey, good morning. I was hoping to go back to one of the smaller portion of the mortgage business there on data analytics. I think that run rate is about $70 million annually, but the opportunity set as you mentioned is about $4 billion of addressable market there. So I was hoping you can talk to maybe what infrastructure you are putting in place or processes you're putting in place to build that out, maybe help us with the vision for that -- there over the longer term? Benjamin Jackson : Thanks, Ken. This is Ben. So this is an area that we have invested heavily and the business has invested heavily in. And when we're looking at and analyzing doing and the acquisition of Ellie Mae, it's one of the areas we were absolutely most excited about. And the area of this business under data and analytics is really that AIQ business, that's an acquisition that Ellie Mae has done a few years ago. And if you look at the heart of what that business is all about and investments that we've made, it's all about automating the very manual part of the origination workflow. And we've used statistics in the past of -- they are costing around $8,000 per -- per mortgage to manufacturing. And out of that $8,000, $5,200 of it is just associated to manual processing. And at a minimum, we believe through our AI offerings, there is a great opportunity to chip away at minimum half of that, $2,600 in savings is right for automation. And this is things like I mentioned in the script around credit analyzers and last quarter I talked about our income analyzers. This is taking all the stare and compare work that happens and when you get a credit report to see what was the date of it, what was the score. You compare the score on the credit report to the information that we have in our old rigs business around what are the underwriting requirements for the particular product that this customer has applied for. And we're able to automate a ton of the process right now that is done manually, and it's one of the highest growth sales items we've seen. And as I said in an answer to a prior question that we hit a record in Q4 of new sales of this product. And in terms of the $4 billion TAM, it's a pretty easy number to get to. If you look at efficiencies that we provide and assume conservatively, it's $2,600 in savings per loan that -- that we can provide to customers. If we monetize a part of that, say, some subset of that, and you use a round number of around $10 million loans being done per year, which is way down from what it was last year. You do the math on $10 million loans, we roughly have almost 50% market share in loan flow that's going through times 1 subset of that save, and you get to a very big number very quickly. And as our customers are seeing that benefit, we're obviously monetizing it by  providing that to them. Operator : The next question is from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Good morning folks. Maybe just to dig a little bit deeper on the mortgage recurring revenue, the guide of the $122 million to $127 million, it's a bit of a wide range. Maybe if you -- Ben, if you could talk about the variables that you're seeing that sort of impact the low versus the high end of that range? And then if you can -- I think you gave guidance for the recurring revenue in fixed income for the full year. I'm not sure if I missed the recurring revenue guide for Mortgage Technology for the full year or if you have a view on that? And then if I could just waiver in the synergy on the data side in terms of coming up with real time -- more real-time mortgage production data. I know you're working on that. Maybe just an update on -- progress report on that? Scott Hill : Well, okay, so that one question I think had three parts. Let me see if I can hit them. First of all, I don't know that $5 million wide on an over $100 million guide is that wide. It's simply a matter of customers that we've on-boarded and that we expect to continue to on board, I mean, that's the thing. Again, if you look at the history that we provided on that line, our recurring Mortgage Technology revenue in fourth quarter of '19 were $92 million, they were $95 million, $100 million, $108 million, $119 million. So we've seen that consistent growth on a sequential quarterly basis because of everything then talked about. More customers, customers that had a certain number of seats sign up or more seat. And so, we expect growth to go through the quarter and exactly whether or not that growth is going to add $1 million or $3 million, again, on an over $120 million guide, plus or minus a little bit, then it seems like that's the way to guide, because it's not $5 million wide, it's actually plus or minus $2.5 million. But we -- so we feel good about it. What I said on the data business and to be specific, the fixed income recurring revenues, based on 5.7% ASV, we fully expect the business to again go right around that 5% to 6% for the year. As you know that ASV figure now is effectively 100% of the revenue in that segment. And so, we're able to tell you that plus or minus a little bit given that ASV is 5.7% -- we think 5% to 6% growth is the right view in terms of thinking about the full year for that fixed income recurring revenue. With regards to the data piece on mortgages and how they're working with the sales team -- sorry, the Lynn's team to do that, I'll hand that to Ben. See if he's got any thought. Benjamin Jackson : Yes, as I mentioned in the script, there we have identified some early opportunities on the data side. As you can imagine, there is an absolute treasure trove of information and data sets that are within the Mortgage Technology business segment across all the businesses that are in there. So you have the merge business in there, you have simple file, and you have the Encompass system and the Ellie Mae business in there. Some of the areas that we're looking to leverage the data sets, the power of the datasets in there are simple things like, when you're going through a mortgage origination process, one of the most common areas where you'll see errors is very late in the process when you get to the closing. And what happens at the closing is that you have to compare the original estimates of what your closing fees are going to be at the closing table from what the original estimates were that were provided 60 plus days ago. And if those numbers are off by any amount, not even a material amount, it could be zero tolerance, 10% tolerance, you have to go back through the entire origination process again. What we found is Simplifile has all of that information. They know exactly what the closing requirements are, what the fees are in every jurisdiction around the US. We managed all of that reference data for the clients in the closing process. Pulling that type of information, all the way up front to the origination process, and then combining that with our artificial intelligence expertise and automation expertise that we have in our AI tools is able to create a significant amount of more efficiency and a higher quality loan asset that's going to be less subject to errors as you get to the closing table. And a lot of these capabilities in the artificial intelligence area and how to leverage this type of information and data is directly coming from the expertise that we have on the data side of the business. Jeffrey Sprecher : Let me -- this is Jeff. Let me just bridge a wider point, which is, you know we've been building a technology base in the mortgage space, and it's obviously a very hot space, and we've got a really great platform and commodity. And the Ellie Mae business that we acquired was -- really turns out has been a really great business since we've owned it. But don't underestimate that a lot of the acceleration of the growth that we've seen comes from the vision that we are articulating of an end-to-end platform managed by ICE. We live in a society today where many of the platforms that we interact with, you have to ask yourself, am I actually their customer, they're providing a service to meet, but am I actually the customer. Because it is the customer, the person who is buying the data of that platform or is the customer or the person that giving up the data and exchange for free usage. And we're seeing a lot of examples right now in our society of people that believe that these free services are -- that they are actually customers. And in reality, they are not providing any revenue to them. The revenue is coming from a different source. And so, as we're out selling our vision, we're having that conversation with people in the mortgage industry, and it is resonating that very data that you asked Ben about and the way that Artificial Intelligence will interact with that data is an area that ICE has built decades of trust in the financial services industry about how we manage that data, who owns it, where it's going to go and how we're going to protect it. And I think that that bodes well for us as we continue to have a broader conversation in our society about data privacy and data rights. Operator : The next question is from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Blostein : Great. Good morning everybody. Jeff, a question for you around maybe some of the regulatory things, potentially might be on the comp, but really was hoping to get your perspective on everything that's going on in the retail trading side of the equation. It feels like concept of payment for order flow has come up a bunch times in the past, I don't know if this time is going to be any different, but curious to kind of get your perspective on how things might evolve and whether or not with 50% of volumes now trading off exchange, could there be an opportunity for the lit venues to grab some of that market share back? Jeffrey Sprecher : It's a great question. One, obviously, we've been thinking about over the last week or so. I guess I'll remind you that when we bought the New York Stock Exchange, we were pretty vocal about the fact that we thought that the market structure in the US equity space was flawed and that it needed a holistic review. And in fact, we tried to come up with a grand bargain that we talked to many, many people across the industry about that would have resulted in some major change. We were unsuccessful, and the last SEC seem to spend inordinate amount of time on governance of industry consortiums basically that manage infrastructure and didn't really step back and look at the totality of the infrastructure and whether or not it operates properly. And I think as you've heard through the guidance that Scott gave, fortunately or unfortunately that infrastructure paralyzes the industry somewhat and stifles innovation in my view. And so, we're going to have a new SEC Chair and -- Chairman Gensler is confirmed and he actually takes that seat. He is a person that worked in the derivative space in part of his career, worked in the regulated commodities and derivatives space for part of his career and has a deep interest in -- and knowledge of market structure. The SEC has got a dual role to a sense that it's an enforcement agency and a consumer protection agency, as well as a market structure agency. And historically, the people that have shared the agency have been lawyers by training who are much more comfortable on the enforcement and compliance side of things. And I think there is an opportunity and we'll see it in the results, but there is an opportunity with a new Chair and a new vision inside the SEC to potentially talk about a grand bargain again which we would welcome. And by that, I mean, we would give up some unique positioning that we have if others did the same thing and try to get back to a more innovative, transparent regulated market where we could see innovation as it's unique to the United States, continue to grow our capital markets. Operator : The next question is from Ari Ghosh of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Ari Ghosh : Hey, good morning everyone. Ben, just a quick one on Mortgage Tech. Even, you know on the origination tech revenue piece, just curious how we should think about the sensitivity to market conditions will be here, say, either like a backlog or do you have any visibility for a portion of this transaction-based revenues. Again, just curious, because I think you were embedding pretty conservative industry and refi assumptions for the year and the outlook perhaps looks a little more favorable than it did three to four months ago? Thanks. Benjamin Jackson : Thanks, Ari. I'll go -- I'll go through it. How we see the businesses ability to grow through various volume cycles, and I'll answer your direct question around volumes. So if you think about this business -- this business and what really excited about us, and just the results that we've seen in the few months that we've owned it now have just further confirmed the businesses ability to grow through volume environments are that : one, it's continuing to gain market share. I've shared the sales results, so you can see that. Number two, more customers equals more loan flow. And when you have more loan flow going on to that network, on average a loan that's going through our network with customers of ours on the platform, we see that that loan interacts around 7 times with various third parties on the network. So each new loan that comes on to that network, they are 7 different times that it's interacting with third-party service providers and services that we provide on that network, and for third-party service providers, we get a fee for the efficiency that we provide for somebody interacting with that loan. The third area is just -- it's a process that's right for automation, and I touched upon the opportunity there, around 10 million loans, and at least $2,600 in efficiency and some subset of that if you do the math, and it's a big number. And then the fourth area is the electronification of the close that we are in a very unique position with the MERS and Simplifile assets in the network that we have on the closing side that's extremely unique, integrating that with our origination network through Encompass by connecting that into an eClose room, and we have several big deliveries this year, one in Q2 of our hybrid eClose offering, and then followed shortly after in the second half of the year a full eClose offering. We see that's going to be an area of growth for 2022 and beyond. When it comes to volumes itself, we do have a bit of a unique insight, because we are in origination platform. We see almost 50% of loans that are originated in the US. We do see that the loans very early on in the process. So we see them on -- the original application is coming through for a refinancing or a purchase, which gives us 60 day to 90 day preview of what the market is going to look like. You also -- you look at industry analysts, you see the estimates that are out there. If you go beyond a quarter or two, anyone that follows these estimates know that they are subject to revision and significant revision. It's very hard to predict mortgage origination volumes out beyond a couple of quarters, just like it's hard to predict US equity market volumes and oil volumes going out a few quarters to a year. What I would say is, based on the data that we see in our platform, if you take the estimates like Fannie and Freddie for the next quarter to maximum two quarters. Those are as close to what we see in the data on our platform as being indicative of what we expect volumes to be. But beyond that, it's difficult to forecast. But underneath the covers with all the other growth areas that we have regardless of volume environment, we are up -- we are very optimistic that this business can grow. Operator : The next question is from Chris Allen of Compass Point. Please go ahead. Chris Allen : Good morning guys. I just wanted to follow-on mortgage beat. I just wanted to ask, just in terms of the share gains that you're seeing, how much is coming from existing customers versus new customers? And any update in terms of penetration of the independent mortgage banks which I think as you talked about in the past is potentially 20%, 25% share opportunity over the longer term? Scott Hill : Sure. So we're actually seeing -- thanks, Chris, for the question. So we're seeing growth literally across every segment of customer in our platform. So yes, independent mortgage bankers, we are seeing their share of the market. It'd be very strong, in particular, on the purchase side of the market. With refinances, you do tend to see some refinance volume to go to some of the -- some of the large banks, just because that's where you have a lot of your banking relationship with -- people tend to go there, but in the purchase market, we are seeing that independent banks are continuing to grow. That said, we're growing in each segment. So we service the large banks, we service the independent mortgage banks, we service correspondent banks, wholesale banks, you name it. And what we're looking at that sales strength that I referenced earlier, we're seeing -- we're seeing that strength across the -- across the entire portfolio. And one other thing I'd just highlight on the volume front here, we tend to -- if you look at our share and our strength, a lot of it is balanced in the purchase market, albeit we do interact a lot with the refinance market as well. When we look at the trends of what happened in 2020 and going into this year, we're seeing application volumes up significantly in refi, they are up as well significantly in purchase, but not as much as refi. And on the refinance side, if you look at estimates that Fannie and Freddie have, for example, for 30-year mortgages of 2.7% to 2.9% right now for calendar year 2021, that puts up to 20 million units significantly in the money for refinancing, which is a higher number than what we said when we actually announced this deal. So we still see a tail in refinance volumes. We're seeing -- underneath the covers, one of the things on purchase, we are seeing pent up demand on the purchase side. There is just not a lot of inventory out there. So as vaccines rollout, as the economy starts rolling, as people are willing to move and actually sell, I think you have a decent amount of purchase demand pent up there as well, which given that our market shares tend to be a little bit more tilted towards purchase and refi, that's another tailwind for us. Operator : The next question is from Owen Lau of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Owen Lau : Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. So on Slide 20, you disclosed that you have a 1.4% ownership in coin base. Could you please talk about the cost basis? Why did you make that investment and is there any synergy with ICE or Bakkt? Thank you. Jeffrey Sprecher : Yes, that's a good question. First of all, as a company, we never thought that we were a private equity firm or venture firm, and that -- that we should be stewards of our shareholders' money in that regard. We've always thought that excess capital should be returned. But we have made investments in a number of businesses that are adjacent to us, where we thought there was some strategic advantage by having a relationship with the company, either by partnering with them or by a knowledge transfer and what have you. And so, we invested in coin base in its early rounds, because we were trying to understand the blockchain and the significance of digital currencies in payments and that's -- and obviously the company has been phenomenally successful. And I'm sure the value of our stake has increased, and our investment was just almost insignificant honestly, so, in terms of a monetary number. The -- I would also say, we have, obviously, a similar kind of investment in Bakkt, which again was driven by us, trying to understand blockchain. And as you may recall, three years ago, two and three years ago, a lot of people were asking us whether blockchain was going to be used for clearing, whether it was going to disrupt the traditional financial services industry, and we wanted to be on top of that technology and have that knowledge. And so, we also invested and help stand up Bakkt, which again, I think as a company that we have a small basis -- a basis that has dramatically increased, say that way. We also made an investment in Euroclear, which is European custody solution that again where we have adjacency too. Our company is doing very, very well. And so, we do have, as your question, I think, I was trying to allude to a number of very, very interesting assets that have value, that I think over time will try to unlock for our shareholders as those partnerships and knowledge transfers come to some fruition. Operator : The next question is from Kyle Voigt of KBW. Please go ahead. Kyle Voigt : Hi. Good morning. So in the fourth quarter, S&P Global announced its acquisition of IHS. Just last week, we had the LSE Refinitiv deal close. Just give me size of these transactions. Can you just talk about the kind of broad competitive environment and landscape in your fixed income and data segment? And maybe how you would expect the environment to evolve as some of these competitors gain scale or add product breadth? Jeffrey Sprecher : Sure. Well, I'm glad to say that we recognized early the adjacency of data and information and analytics around risk management and move relatively quickly to formalize our internal offerings and also make acquisitions, similar large acquisitions for us that -- that is really now probably half of our business in serving data and analytics. And I use that number roughly, but it's somewhat how we think of the business. They are intertwined virtuous circle of risk management along with the data and information that it takes to manage our portfolio risk. And so, it's not surprising to us that others are making moves in that space. With respect to all the companies actually that you mentioned, we have some relationships with them, and in both, at times, we use some of their platforms and at times they use some of our platforms and data and indices. And so, you've seen a movement of large exchange and data information groups advancing their own businesses, but also somewhat collaborating across the industry where necessary. So we have a good relationship with the managers of all of those companies, even though in some areas we are fierce competitors, and in other areas, we cooperate for the betterment of the industry. Operator : The next question is from Simon Clinch of Atlantic Equities. Please go ahead. Simon Clinch : Hi, there. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if we'd jump back to the mortgage tech side again. And just to your comments about -- just under 50% market share on the origination side, I was wondering if you could talk about the -- how you see the future competitive environment developing in origination and what you think -- where you think that market share can go? Is that a natural cap to that market share for you in the normal way? Benjamin Jackson : Thanks, Simon. What's -- what's amazing when we -- as we've -- over the last decade looked at the mortgage space, you've got an area of the marketplace that you can't emphasize enough how analog it is. When you look at -- to your -- that market share that I had mentioned, and you say, what's second behind that. What's second behind that is a lot of homegrown systems, excel spreadsheet or stitched together systems. And that's what gave us a ton of confidence in doing this transaction that there is a long way to go in terms of market share just in the origination side. But the other piece that -- that I can't emphasize enough is that, we are in a very unique position where not only do we have this very strong origination network in helping to write a ton of benefit to our customers in automating this manual workflow, we're in a unique position where we also have these significant network in the electronification of the close, in that closing process. And where the magic we see is really going to happen in this deal is not only in the automation or the origination front, but by standing up, which we have done in eClosing room that for the first time we'll link your underwriter of your loans to the bank or independent mortgage company and the underwriter that's underwriting your loan to your attorney, your settlement agent, your title insurance provider, et cetera, all into a digital closing room to be able to codify that transaction closes electronically, register it on MERS, both in note as well as -- as well as the loan, be able to electronically vault all the documentation associated to it, and file it in the local county courthouse electronically by a Simplifile. That is an incredible capability that we're introducing to the market. We already have several key strategic pieces of it launched, because we had a partnership with Ellie Mae prior to doing the transaction. And as I mentioned earlier, we have some very key pieces of functionality that are in the pilot phase and rolling out in Q2 on our eClose solution. And then we have another big set of functionality coming out in the second half of this year, that's all going to lead to long-term 2022-2023 additional tailwinds for this business. Jeffrey Sprecher : Yes, just to focus on how we're thinking about mortgage right now, the real opportunity for us is to take the loan origination customers that were on Ellie Mae and get them to use the other services on our network that we find that the customers that use the entire network have a multiple of revenues for us beyond those that are simply using the loan origination platform. So the market share, if you are, that we're looking at internally is the bigger TAM of end-to-end services that Ben just described. And we have seen, and I've been involved, and Ben has been involved, and Scott has been involved, actually all of the three of us here have all been involved in helping Ellie close some LOS deals, where we've been able to articulate the end-to-end vision, and that's brought the new customer to the platform for the loan origination system, but it is that full vision I think that is -- that is helping to increase the market share if you solely look at loan origination. But the bigger addressable market for us is taking those already loan origination customers and getting them to use the end-to-end network. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Sprecher at this time. Jeffrey Sprecher : Thank you, Kate. I thank all of you for joining us this morning, and we'll look forward to speaking to you again soon. But in the meantime, I hope that you stay safe and that you and your loved ones stay healthy. And with that, we'll conclude the call and have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mary Caroline O'Neal, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Mary Caroline O'Neal: Good morning. ICE's first quarter 2021 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements please refer to our 2020 Form 10-K, first quarter Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC. Scott Hill : Thanks, Mary Caroline. Congratulations on your new role, truly well deserved. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with some key highlights from our first quarter results. First quarter revenues, operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share were all the best in the history of our company. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.34 increased 7% compared to our previous record of $1.25, which we achieved in last year's first quarter. Record total first quarter revenues of $1.8 billion were up 4% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Total transaction revenues declined slightly versus an unprecedented backdrop a year ago. Importantly though, total recurring revenues, which represent about half our business, increased by 9% with all three of our business segments contributing to the strong year-over-year growth. First quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $729 million, including $30 million related to Bakkt. Without the additional $7 million of Bakkt investments, we would have been toward the lower end of our original guidance. We expect that Bakkt's merger with Victory Park Spac will be completed toward the end of this quarter. We expect second quarter adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $742 million to $752 million, including approximately $35 million of additional expense related to Bakkt. Incorporating the additional Bakkt expenses into our full year guidance as well as slightly higher-than-expected FX, which will be more than offset by higher revenues, we now expect full year adjusted expenses to be in the range of $2.88 billion to $2.93 billion. Ben Jackson : Congratulations to you, Scott. Thank you, and good morning to everyone on the call. Please turn to Slide 8. As we begin to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic and the highly volatile environment we experienced in 2020. Our customers continue to rely on our global energy markets to navigate uncertainty and manage risk. And importantly, it's our network expertise and investment in technology that enables us to deliver innovative customer solutions and capture the growth opportunities provided by secular trends, such as the growing complexity of energy markets alongside the energy transition. In our oil markets, Brent crude serves as the cornerstone of a global network that includes key benchmarks such as WTI, Gasoil, RBOB Gas and most recently, Murban crude oil. By leveraging our global network, the launch of ICE Futures Abu Dhabi, or IFAD, has enabled for the first time participants to come together and contribute to the price formation of Murban, an important benchmark for oil flowing through to Asia. In just its first month, Murban, along with related derivatives has traded over 150,000 contracts across 49 firms with growing open interest now over 45,000 lots making it one of the most successful futures launches in our industry's history. Jeff Sprecher : Thank you, Ben, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn now to Slide 9. In the first quarter, we once again grew revenues, grew adjusted operating income and grew adjusted earnings per share, delivering the best quarter in our company's history. And remarkably, we did this against last year's record-breaking volumes and volatility, which was largely driven by the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Our results are a testament to the value of our data, technology and the strength of our strategic business model. The compounding growth of our subscription based services, combined with our diverse transaction-based businesses means that our growth is not tied to one economic cycle to one geography or to one asset class. Rather, it means growth on top of growth through all rate environments, across asset classes and around the world. Over the past 20 years, ICE has continually evolved to meet the needs of our customers and provide value for our stockholders. And for the past 14 years, I've had the privilege of working alongside Scott Hill as our growth story has unfolded. ICE has completed dozens of deals and made thousands of strategic decisions that have been rooted in the information and the quality metrics that were ingrained in our culture by Scott. Scott not only provided financial leadership for the company but he's played a vital role in providing strategic vision. He championed our unique culture, and he's mentored younger generations of leaders. And so I want to thank Scott for his contribution, for his dedication and for his leadership. And I want to wish him our best as he moves on to tackle the difficult life of branching in Texas. Scott will officially transition next month, and he'll remain an adviser and a mentor to ensure a smooth transition as Warren Gardner assumes the duties of CFO. Warren's has worked closely with Scott over the last 4 years and covered our sector as a senior research analyst for many years prior to this. Warren's knowledge of our business and our industry will help us to continue to build on the foundation that's been established by Scott, and continue a track record of growth. I also want to welcome MC as our new Investor Relations Head. Let me say thank you to our customers for their business and their trust in the quarter. And I want to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contribution to delivering the best quarter in our company's history. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to our moderator, Chad, to conduct the question-and-answer session, which will run until 9 :30 Eastern time. Operator : Thank you. And the first question will come from Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Rich Repetto : Good morning, Jeff and Scott, and Scott, all the praise and comments are well deserved, so congratulations. My first question will be on the Mortgage segment. And I guess it's been on spot but you reclassified the line and you sort of explained that. But I'm trying to understand how you outgrew what looked like Dodd industry originations and when we look at those four lines now that are reclassified, which ones are recurring and which ones are transactional, so we can model it out. And then lastly, which will be more dependent on refi or purchase mortgages? Ben Jackson : Thanks, Rich. This is Ben. And thanks for observing what we've seen in the marketplace in terms of a downturn in transaction volumes as I can confirm, we saw a downturn in closed loans on our encompass platform. When you look at Q1 closed loan volume versus Q4. And as our results are testament to, we were able to grow through it. And what I'd point to is what we said when we originally announced the deal back in September, in that we see, just like we saw in the commodities markets 2 decades ago, just like we've seen in the fixed income markets that the mortgage space is an industry that's going through a significant analog to digital transition. And we knew by combining the closing network that we have with the unique customer originator and investor network that Ellie Mae has that we can do something really special here for our customers in providing a digital future and a lot of efficiencies. And that's how we got conviction that we can grow through long-term cycles. And that's how we put out a guide, a 10-year guide of roughly doubling revenue when you look at that 8% to 10% guide over a 10-year period. That's roughly doubling revenue. And what we've seen in the platform has done nothing but strengthen our conviction over the last 8 months in our ability to do that. Last quarter, I mentioned that Q3 and Q4 sales expectations well exceeded our model. That we put together last summer when we did the deal. And Q1 continued this trend. And what we get \u2013 tactically, what you get when you're increasing your penetration into new sales, you're getting new subscription revenue when you implement and then as you ramp the customers up, you're getting more loans that you're interacting with is you're never interacting with before. Those loans than interactive services are our network. So you have a flywheel effect, you have a compounding effect. But I think more importantly, this is what I was trying to get through in the script, is that when a customer is choosing our solution set, they're choosing to fundamentally change their business. They're fundamentally choosing to remove manual processing and adopt digital ways to automate. And when they select us, they're selecting us to be the heart and lungs there. To be their network that's interconnecting them to every player that we interact with from our front-to-back network. And as they realize those benefits from being part of our ecosystem, it enables us to cross-sell our other services that I also mentioned in the script, such as our AIQ offering, which is that automation of the underwrite, as well as eClose. So that's what gives us conviction on the ability to grow this business sequentially, quarter-over-quarter on subscription revenue growth and to grow through downturns or to outperform downturns in terms of volumes just as we did Q1 versus Q4. Warren Gardiner : And \u2013 hey Rich, this is Warren. I'll just try to give you a little bit of color on the subscription versus transaction breakdown. Most of the subscription revenue is going to be in that origination technology line. And within that, it\u2019s pretty balanced between subscription and transaction. The other part of subscription is going to be in data and analytics. And then when you think about transaction side of that, it\u2019s going to be the closing \u2013 that\u2019s pretty closing solutions, that\u2019s pretty much 100% transaction and then others transaction as well. And so hopefully, that helps you a little bit in terms of color, but we haven\u2019t broken those out quite yet, so... Rich Repetto : Got it. It\u2019s helpful. Thanks guys. Operator : And the next question will come from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Mike Carrier : Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Maybe just on the capital front, given the Coinbase gain you expected in 2Q. Just wanted to get an update on how you guys are prioritizing your debt pay-down if you expect to get your target leverage faster? And then any other investment areas for growth in the business? Warren Gardiner : Yes. Mike, it\u2019s Warren again. So yes, we are definitely a bit ahead of schedule, been paying down debt faster than we sort of expected when we started the deal. I mean I would say we were doing that, though, before the Coinbase sale. You look at the quarter, we generated about 300 and \u2013 $734 million of cash flow. We used that to pay down a little \u2013 or close to $350 million of debt, raised our dividend by 10%, and then also invest in the business. So, I think when you think about this Coinbase proceeds, that\u2019s really \u2013 that gives us some additional flexibility as we kind of move into the rest of the year. And as Scott said, we are down to about 3.6 leverage, the target is about 3.25, where we can start to think about buying back stock, but again, as Scott said \u2013 but again, this is just giving us a little bit of flexibility, and we will give you guys kind of more of an update as we get a bit closer to that in terms of what we will do with buybacks. Mike Carrier : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : The next question is from Ken Hill with Loop Capital. Please go ahead. Ken Hill : Hi, good morning everyone. So, I wanted to start with ICE Futures Abu Dhabi. I know you guys had a really strong start with the Murban crude contract. You talked about some of the records. Ben, I think in the prepared remarks, you talked about being one of the most successful launches there. I was hoping you could maybe outline a little bit on the broader ambitions in regions there, whether it\u2019s Middle East or Asia, how you might be leveraging that success there and thinking about kind of like a land and expand type of opportunity in other ICE products, whether that\u2019s on the trading side or on the data side? How should we be thinking about that in those regions there? Thanks. Ben Jackson : Thanks for the question, Ken. It\u2019s Ben. And when you look at our futures markets and how we have developed them versus any of our peers, we have been stayed very close to the commercial customer base since our inception. And that\u2019s what\u2019s enabled us to develop literally hundreds of oil contracts around the world because it helps our customers not only manage the risk in a benchmark contract, but also help them manage their risk at the point of consumption or the point of production of where they have real risk. And we are the only truly global platform that enables customers with deep liquid markets in hundreds of marketplaces to be able to manage that risk. And with the backdrop of COVID going on the past year, we didn\u2019t stop moving. We continued to partner with our commercial customers around the world, and that\u2019s what led to the launch of ICE Futures Abu Dhabi, just in the last few weeks here. And in the early days, it looks like one of it to be \u2013 one of the most successful futures launches in history. And what I would point to with that is not only the volume growth, but also the \u2013 importantly, the significant open interest growth and the fact that there is 49 major players that are in there utilizing the contracts, establishing positions to manage risk. And I look at that compared to other parts of our oil business, that across the board are doing very well. If you compare our overall oil open interest right now in April versus the fourth quarter, we are up in almost every major product category. You compare April oil open interest versus April 2019, we are up in almost every category. If you look at under the covers from a year-over-year basis, while there is some tough compares, in there. We have significant product sets, such as our Asia Refined products set, gas oil in Dubai that are up year-over-year. So, we believe we have a great foundation. We have already been in Asia, have a number of significant products out there that enabled customers to hedge and manage risk. And we are going to stay very close to our commercial customer base to look for more opportunities to do so. Jeff Sprecher : And this is Jeff. I think we \u2013 to get a little more embellishment, we have launched, I believe, now a dozen derivative contracts on that exchange. So we are moving quickly, if you will, to build out a broader product suite there. And one of the things that Ben alluded to and it was inferred in your question is that there is a large Asia presence of commercial users that operate in and around comfortably in the Middle East. So it gives us an interesting launch point, if you will, for additional derivative contracts. So, I think you will see us continue to build out this amazing suite that we have, including Abu Dhabi as a vehicle. Ken Hill : Got it. Thanks for the additional color there. Operator : And the next question will come from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Blostein : Great. Thanks. Good morning everybody and to echo everyone\u2019s comments, Scott, Warren, MC, big congrats to all of you. I wanted to go back to the mortgage business for a second. So clearly, organic growth remains really strong. Ben, great to hear that the sales momentum continues to be above projections in the first quarter. But the market clearly seems to be overly concerned about the refi cliff, so to speak, in the market, which would hit your transaction revenue. So, can you help us maybe unpack how much of the $230 million is related to transaction revenues, is refi versus new purchases? I think legacy LMA was about 50-50, but that mix probably has evolved here. And I guess, how would you frame the downside risk to this revenue bucket, assuming current industry refinance expectations come through? And then secondly, I was hoping maybe we could hit on the expense interplay here as well to an extent that transaction revenues come down. Is there any expense offset we could see in that segment? Thanks. Ben Jackson : Thanks Alex. This is Ben. I will start, and then I will hand it to Warren on the expense side. So, when you look at the \u2013 you had a number of different questions in there, so I will try to unpack a couple of different things that we are seeing. So first, the answer that I had for Rich\u2019s question is important to go back to. So, we are not looking at this as a quarter-over-quarter business and really worry or afraid about volumes that are changing each quarter because we see that there is just a long-term change that\u2019s happening towards digitization. We see substantial TAMs that are out there that when you look at our presence in each of those TAMs have not only a long runway, but we have a lot of opportunity for growth in each of them. The core being that Encompass and the network set that we have, where we have a little over 20% if you look at the trailing 12 months, roughly 20% of that TAM is a starting place that we have. And as we continue to sign new customers, as we continue to onboard those customers on, we are interacting with new loans, we are getting to more subscription revenue, we are getting more transaction volume, and those loans are interacting with more services on our network. We believe we are very well positioned to go after that. The other thing I can\u2019t emphasize enough is the other two TAMs are really a cross-sell opportunity. We are already touching at some point in our network from our customer acquisition and the point-of-sale systems that we have to the loan origination network that we have that\u2019s now interconnected to our closing network. We are touching just about every player in the mortgage ecosystem. So, our ability to sell these new services is a cross-sell. So, we feel very, very good about our position to grow in the closing \u2013 against the closing TAM, which we have roughly a 20% of that TAM today. But we are very uniquely positioned with the new eClose offering that we have launched to go after a significant amount more of that. And then on the AIQ, that\u2019s the automation of the actual underwrite process itself. We are seeing \u2013 we continue to see record sales volumes of that product, which, again, is a cross-sell to core Encompass customers. When it comes to mix on our platform, because if you look at just the loan originations side, there is a little bit of a tilt towards nonbank originators and nonbank originators tend to have a slight tilt towards purchase market versus refi. A lot of people do their refis with banks that they \u2013 large banks that they have their established banking relationships with. We tend to benefit more from a market that\u2019s moving more towards purchase. But that said, it\u2019s on the edges there. And when you look at our entire network, we are working with just about every player in the industry is utilizing one of our services around one point of our network. Warren Gardiner : And Alex, it\u2019s Warren. Just quickly on the expenses. So, there are definitely some variable expenses in there. What you would probably normally think about comp, marketing spend, things of that nature. But as Ben said, this isn\u2019t about second half or this isn\u2019t about a particular quarter. This is about a 10-year plan or strategy of doubling revenues from where we are today. And so we are going to continue to invest in that business. We talked about $40 million to $45 million, I think, when we gave guidance at the start of the year. And I think that should still kind of incremental expense, I should say. And so that\u2019s just still be kind of what you expect, I think, as you are looking into the second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter and expect that to kind of ramp as things like investments like eClose and things of that nature, kind of continue to pick up some steam. Operator : Thank you. And the next question will come from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Good morning folks. And also my congrats to Scott, Warren and MC as well. Just a two parter, again on Mortgage Tech. It\u2019s the topic of today, of course. Just in terms of that \u2013 of the strength in origination, Ben, if you can just touch on the recurring revenue side, the impact of market share gains versus revenues \u2013 cross-sell revenue synergies into that network base? And then the second part is on the closing side. I think you said 20% of $1 billion TAM. It looks like the revenue run rate there is $280 million. So, just want to double check. So that would be 28%, but I am sure I am using different denominators there. So, I just wanted to check on that and then your optimism on the growth in the closed business versus the rest of the Mortgage Technology business? Ben Jackson : Thanks Brian. I will hit that last part first. So on the roughly 20%, I am looking at the last 12 months, and it\u2019s a rough gauge on that piece. The first part of the question, repeat the core of what you are looking for there? Brian Bedell : The core of that is from the recurring revenue gains that you have mentioned in the Mortgage Tech segment, especially in origination technology. Maybe if you can characterize what\u2019s coming from market share gains, from Encompass being better \u2013 getting better penetration of Encompass across the banks and financial network versus actual cross-sell into the network on \u2013 so it\u2019s more like a synergy basis? Ben Jackson : Yes. Sure. So \u2013 and that\u2019s what I first answer that I gave to Rich, pleased with the new sales results that we have seen as well as cross-sell results that we have seen on the platform. And the way to think about that recurring revenue and what gives us confidence in the fact that, that recurring revenue will grow sequentially quarter-over-quarter, and we are guiding to growth next quarter is that we continue to see \u2013 and there is a mix in that recurring revenue line of customers that are expanding their footprint with us. And expanding their footprint with us can mean that they are adding new loan officers, they have more volume on their platform, so they go ahead and expand their footprint with us. And when they do that, that falls to the subscription line item very quickly. The second thing that you see is that we have cross-sells of other products to our customer base so they expand and buy other services that we have. It could be our AllRegs business, our Mavent business, very importantly, our AIQ services. So, we are seeing that as a very high cross-sell into our customer base. Some of those services require a short implementation timeframe, so after we sell it, there may be a lag before the subscription revenue comes. But that\u2019s the other element. And then new customers, we are seeing new customer acquisition. As I mentioned last quarter, a record Q3 and Q4 in terms of gathering new customers. And then Q1 well exceeded our expectations, both in our original model as well as our budget in terms of signing new customers onto the platform. And when we sign those new customers onto the platform, they do need to be implemented. It\u2019s a cloud-based platform, so the implementation isn\u2019t that long, but there is some lag between when we sell it, and then that drops to the subscription line. And then once the customers implement it, they start to ramp, and that\u2019s when we start to see the loan transaction volume and then those loans interacting with our network, then build and then we see more transaction volume building on that. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. That\u2019s great color. Thank you. Operator : And the next question will come from Ari Ghosh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Ari Ghosh : Hi, good morning everyone. Maybe just a quick follow-up, so Ben on Mortgage Tech. Maybe you just talked about customers expanding their subscription footprint with you, so as we think about that $4 billion data TAM that you highlighted, can you talk about the current data and analytics usage by a captive customer base, what\u2019s the level of customer penetration at present? Are these customers utilized a competitor data products or just maybe not leveraging much of these analytics in their workflows at present? Just to get a sense of penetration levels and the ease of kind of acquiring some of these services and growing that footprint, subscription footprint? Thanks so much. Ben Jackson : Thanks for that question, Ari. It\u2019s Ben again. So, this is an area when you look at just the raw numbers versus the TAM. We are obviously very early stages here. So, we have 2% to 3% of the TAM, is what we have if you look at our current revenues versus a $4 billion opportunity here. And this we see as a near-term TAM that we are executing against. That\u2019s why we had it in the script. That\u2019s why we have highlighted in the last couple of calls that this AIQ offering is really seeing some good pickup across our customer base. We had record sales of it in the third quarter and fourth quarter. And this is another area where we have well exceeded our expectations into Q1 of really cross-selling this service into our Encompass customer base. And what this enables is it\u2019s really the core of where you are able to take out a ton of the manual processing. We have mentioned that our estimates are that it costs $8,000 to manufacture a loan today. And out of that, about $5,200 of that is just manual processing. And by first applying our automated document recognition and extraction technology, but then also putting our mortgage expertise on top of that to say, okay, as we extract this data out of the documents, as we automate it, we are able to take that information, put it into a database and compare it to what the income qualification and credit qualifications are for a particular product set because we have that whole \u2013 in our AllRegs business, we have the entire reference data set of, depending on the product, the customer is applying for, we know exactly what the qualification criteria are of that. So, we are able to take a lot of the manual steering compare work of comparing information that came in on our original customer application versus what\u2019s coming in as we are getting documents that we can verify and also cross-reference against what the criteria are to apply for that particular product. So, we feel great about it. It\u2019s early, but we are seeing this really as customers are starting to adopt it, they are getting the benefit of it. We are seeing other customers are catching from word-of-mouth in the industry that this is providing real benefits from their peers, and we are seeing our funnel just continue to strengthen in this area. And again, for the most part, it\u2019s a cross-sell into our existing base. Ari Ghosh : Got it. Thanks so much and again congratulation Scott, Warren and MC as well. Operator : Thank you. And the next question will be from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Chris Harris : Thanks guys. On ICE Abu Dhabi, can you talk a little bit about how Murban might be distinctive or why you think it will win for some of the other benchmark alternatives that are out there targeting Asia? Scott Hill : Yes, it\u2019s a good question. One of the sort of historical roots of the commodity exchange business has been that commodity tend to be priced at their near the source. In other words, it was grain price at grain elevators that were located near the fields. And in the case of energy, it\u2019s oil, natural gas or electricity price somewhere locationally near where it\u2019s produced. And then from a hedging standpoint, as a hedger would buy a contract on an exchange they would then need to add to that hedge a transportation or movement hedge on top of the commodity hedge. And so we \u2013 and as we got into organizing these commodities on futures exchanges that have clearing houses, the clearers price the risk, the credit risk of their customers. And so the commodity price that is determined on the exchange, if you will, doesn\u2019t have the customer credit risk in it, and it doesn\u2019t have the delivery risk in it. So in a sense, it\u2019s a pure commodity near where it\u2019s produced. And so one of the tensions that\u2019s going on in the market, particularly with the growth of Asia, China and more broadly, all of Asia is exchanges that we are forming up and pricing their product at the point of delivery. And so that\u2019s a different paradigm, if you will, for traditional commodities. And so one of the reasons that the State Oil Company of Abu Dhabi, began to work with us was the recognition of the fact that they had a strong desire to continue to control pricing of the commodity or have the \u2013 actually the market control pricing of the commodity at its point of production. And that the risk of delivery not being transferred back to the producer by having a delivery price contract. And so that was really the motivation, along with the continued growth of the Middle East and modernization of the infrastructure in the Middle East. And so it\u2019s a really good location, if you will, because of the energy footprint there and also just the growing economies of the Middle East and the interplay between the Middle East and Asia just seem like a very good place for us to have a geographic reference. And it\u2019s not surprising. We have done a lot of work underneath this launch, as you can imagine. And really, because of our global footprint, we are able to talk to commercial users around the world. But it\u2019s not fully surprising to us that this is working because of that historical dynamic was actually playing in our favor. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Sprecher for any closing remarks. Jeff Sprecher : Thank you, Chad. I want to again thank Scott Hill for his amazing contributions to the company and for all the success. And I want to thank everyone here for joining us this morning. We look forward to updating you as we continue to execute and innovate. And with that we will close the call and have a great day. Operator : Thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Should you need assistance, please signal a conference specialist by pressing star then zero. After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. To ask a question, you may press star then one on your touchtone phone. To withdraw your question, please press star then two. Mary Caroline O\u2019Neal: Good morning. ICE\u2019s second quarter 2021 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of theice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today\u2019s call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions, and uncertainties. Please refer to our 2020 Form 10-K, second quarter Form 10-Q, and other filings with the SEC. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You\u2019ll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP term in the earnings materials. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share.  Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, references to revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain items. With us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Warren Gardiner, Chief Financial Officer; Ben Jackson, President; and Lynn Martin, President of Fixed Income and Data Services. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Warren. Warren Gardiner : Thanks MC. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. I\u2019ll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our second quarter results. Adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.16, up 12% year-over-year. Net revenues totaled $1.7 billion and on a pro forma basis were up 4% versus last year. While total transaction revenues declined slightly, our recurring revenues which now represent over half of our business, increased by 10% with all three of our business segments contributing to the strong year-over-year growth.  Adjusted operating expense totaled $744 million. Our investment in Bakkt contributed approximately $36 million to second quarter expenses and were offset by approximately $9 million of net revenues. We now anticipate that Bakkt\u2019s announced transaction with Victory Park will close in the third quarter.  Looking to the second half, we expect third quarter adjusted operating expense to be in the range of $770 million to $780 million, including $55 million related to Bakkt which we expect will be offset by $12 million of net revenue. Incorporating third quarter Bakkt expense into our full year guide, we now expect 2021 adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $2.95 billion to $2.98 billion. Benjamin Jackson : Thank you Warren, and good morning to everyone on the call. Please turn to Slide 8. In the second quarter, interest rate volatility, global economic reopening, and the continued evolution of energy markets once again drove customers to our deep liquid markets to manage their risk. This resulted in open interest records across the platform, and through July open interest continues to build, increasing 9% versus last year and reaching a new record for our total futures complex this week. Greenhouse gas emissions and the evolution of energy markets are becoming increasingly important to market participants around the world, as evidenced by the 40% growth in the number of customers in our global environmental markets since 2016. Volumes in those markets also continue to grow, up 27% in second quarter and up 22% per year on average over the past five years. Lynn Martin : Thank you Ben, and good morning to everyone on the call. Please turn to Slide 10. Data is a core competency at ICE. Whether it\u2019s by-product of our exchanges, evaluated prices for fixed income securities, indices and front office tools, or data and analytics used across the mortgage workflow, data connects the different businesses across the ICE platform and connects ICE to participants across asset classes and around the world. Our comprehensive fixed income data platform continues to deliver compounding revenue growth as these markets automate and as passive investing grows. Our quality evaluated prices provide mission critical transparency for nearly 3 million securities per day. Combined with our comprehensive reference data offering, these form the building blocks to index construction and product development. The accelerating growth of passive investing and the efforts we\u2019ve made to increase the breadth of our offerings and flexibility of our approach to index construction has contributed to the double digit annual growth in our index business since we acquired the Bank of America Merrill Lynch franchise in 2017. A key driver of that growth has been an increase in the passive ETF AUM benchmark to our indices, growing to over $300 billion from less than $100 billion in 2017.  Part of that growth is being driven by established ETFs transitioning their benchmarks to ICE, including $60 billion of AUM that has announced the transition during 2021 to date. ICE data indices now represents just under 20% of the growing fixed income ETF universe, including over 50% of the muni ETF universe. Additionally, over the last year ICE has launched over 250 new indices across fixed income, equities and commodities, including a growing number of ESG and thematic indices as well as custom indices. Our new index customization platform gives investors direct access to the tools they need to build and quickly back test their own index rules, and through the first half of 2021 customers have created nearly as many custom indices as were created in all of 2020. Our index business is an important part of our broader front office toolkit which also includes solutions like continuous evaluated pricing, best execution, liquidity indicators, and real time curves. These front office tools have grown double digits for the past three year and continue to be an important part of our overall fixed income strategy. Jeffrey Sprecher : Thank you Lynn, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 11. At the heart of our strategy at ICE is our data, technology, and network expertise which connects the different businesses across ICE, enabling us to deliver innovative solutions for our customers. In our index business, as Lynn mentioned, we\u2019ve seen a fair number of exchange traded funds transition their benchmarks to ICE. In addition to the quality of our underlying pricing and reference data, another driver of these moves is the expansion of the reference data constituents that we offer.  Assets under management transitioning to our indices not only benefits our fixed income and data services business, but we\u2019ve seen the cross-selling benefit to our listings business with several biotech companies selecting the New York Stock Exchange as their listing venue. Additionally, by combining our expertise in index construction with our leading global environmental trading markets, we\u2019ve created the ICE Global Carbon Index, a benchmark for the universal price of carbon which is critical to employing market forces to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a cost effective manner. The ICE Global Carbon Index is part of a suite of environmental, social and governance related services that ICE offers to our customers, which also include green bond indices, climate analytics, and our ESG reference data. Earlier this week, we announced the integration of ICE mortgage technologies\u2019 transaction-based mortgage rates into our mortgage prepayment model at ICE Data. As a leading provider of price evaluations for mortgage backed securities, this is an important new offering and it represents the first time that we\u2019ve coupled the valuable underlying content from ICE mortgage technology with our expertise in identifying and creating new data offerings. This enhancement will enable the market to more accurately price mortgage prepayments, which are a critical component for fixed income investors. These are only a few of the many innovative solutions that we\u2019re able to bring to our customers as a result of the synergistic relationships that exist across our platform, which makes the whole of ICE greater than the sum of its parts.  Looking at the first half of this year, amidst the backdrop of rising interest rates and rising commodity prices yet lower equity market volatility and mortgage refinance volumes, we once again grew revenues, grew adjusted operating income, and grew adjusted earnings per share. These results are a testament to the strategy that we\u2019ve operated for the past 20 years, the business model that we\u2019ve intentionally built, and the value of our strategic capital allocation. We\u2019ve deliberately positioned the company to have a mix of transaction and compounding subscription revenues to give investors upside exposure while hedging our downside risk. We target markets where there is an analog to digital conversion taking place. We diversify our global footprint because at all times, somewhere in the world, there are risks that our customers and our potential customers need to manage. We strategically deploy our capital, both into and out of opportunities to maximize shareholder value. The combination of these factors is what makes ICE and all-weather name that generates growth on top of growth. Before I end my prepared remarks, I\u2019d like to say thank you to our customers for their business and for their trust in this quarter, and I\u2019d like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contribution to both the best second quarter and the best first half in our company\u2019s history. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call back to our moderator, Shawn, and we\u2019ll conduct a question and answer session until 9 :30 Eastern time. Operator :  The first question today will come from Rich Repeto with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Rich Repeto : Yes, good morning Jeff, good morning Warren, good morning team.  My first question is on the mortgage business. Just trying to see if we can get some more clarification on how--when the interest rate environment changes, how it\u2019s going to impact the mortgage business, especially in the back half of the year. If you look, you know, you held up pretty well versus what the industry forecast, but how should we think about when the forecast of over 20% or 20% down quarter to quarter, Jeff and Warren? Benjamin Jackson : Hey Rich, it\u2019s Ben. I\u2019ll take this one. As we\u2019ve talked about on the prior calls, what we\u2019re doing here is we\u2019re building a business that\u2019s going to be resilient to cyclical volume trends, and at the same time capitalizing on the secular trend of the overall analog to digital conversion and a long term guide of an 8% to 10% average annual growth in the business. What you see in our results is you saw--if you look at our top line revenue number and you compare that to where--you try to draw a consensus to where the estimates are between Fannie, Freddie, MBA, we beat those numbers and we beat those results of what happened sequentially quarter-over-quarter, and we also, as we pointed out in the script, significantly beat our subscription revenue guide. The couple things that are going on under the covers there is that, one, we\u2019re having incredible sales success, and when we sell new customers, that leads to new subscription revenue as we implement them; and then number two, we\u2019re looking at taking this unprecedented time of volumes that the industry\u2019s seen last year and this year to purposefully engage with our customers on opportunities to increase the amount of subscription revenue that we have and some of the services that we provide along our comprehensive network, such as our loan origination system and our data and analytics platform called AIQ. We are purposefully tilting relationships with new customers as well as when customers are renewing, looking at shifting more of the mix towards subscription. In terms of the volume trend that we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re seeing a purchase market that\u2019s strong but it\u2019s tough on inventory, as is very well publicized, and we\u2019re seeing a refinance market where interest rates popped up in March and they\u2019ve come right back down, so we\u2019re still seeing a refinance market that\u2019s decent. What\u2019s really offsetting any headwinds that refinance has seen has been a significant amount of cash-out refi that is happening in the market, just given the amount of home price appreciation and people taking money off the table to do home improvements or pay off other debt. That\u2019s what\u2019s really happening under the covers. Jeffrey Sprecher : Hey Rich, let me just make one more point to you. Part of the strategy that we have at ICE is to build a company that will grow on top of growth, and so we have really designed the company so that we have interest rate exposure in other parts of the business that drives revenue up, and so the goal here, and as you saw with interest rates picking up, our interest rate futures complex and some of the products around our fixed income complex did better, so part of the strategy with mortgage is to make sure that we\u2019ve bundled it with this all-weather opportunity that we have across the whole business. Rich Repeto : Very helpful, Jeff and Ben. It sort of segues into my follow-up, and that would be on the fixed income side, on the data side it\u2019s clear the dominance you have, and then I guess the question is, will it ever--should we even focus on transaction revenue or is it--will it ever parlay on the transaction side all the data dominance that you\u2019ve established there? Lynn Martin : Yes Rich, this is Lynn. Thanks so much for the question. Now that we\u2019ve brought the execution and data pieces together, and as the fixed income markets have increasingly electronified, given the assets that we have under the umbrella, I think we\u2019re uniquely positioned to not only help the industry automate their workflows but to benefit from that automation.  Last year, we launched a piece of technology which united our execution protocols, but more importantly united our data elements alongside those execution protocols, and as a result you\u2019re starting to see more and more activity through our portfolio trading which leverages our front office data assets. All of that provides a tailwind for us from a distribution perspective as well as from a demand perspective to continue to deliver on those double-digit compounding annual growth rates that I mentioned in my prepared remarks for our front office toolkit. Rich Repeto : Got it, thanks Lynn. That\u2019s all my questions, thank you. Operator : Your next question today will come from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Blostein : Great, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping to start with the energy business. ICE is seeing significant growth in the environmental product, as you mentioned in one of the slides, I guess emissions futures in particular. It\u2019s a pretty high capture rate product, so I was hoping to dig in a little more here. One, spend a few minutes on how this market is evolving and how do you expect the growth to progress here, and specifically I\u2019m looking to get a sense of what the revenue contribution there is today to ICE, what sort of changes you\u2019re seeing at the customer composition level here, so end customers versus financial players perhaps coming in, how is that evolving geographically, so right it\u2019s largely EU but perhaps U.K., U.S., Asia on the com, and then ultimately competition - again, high capture rate product, how sustainable do you think it ultimately will be? Benjamin Jackson : Thanks Alex, this is Ben. I\u2019ll take this one. As you can appreciate and we\u2019ve talked about in prior calls, we\u2019ve been thinking about the environmental impacts and how to create a market-based mechanism to price carbon for over a decade, and that really came to life when we bought the Climate Exchange over a decade ago. Fast forward to today, for futures and options that are out creating a market-based mechanism to price carbon, we\u2019re 95% of the futures and options marketplace that\u2019s doing that, so we have a tremendous presence around the world. It continues to be a very high growth business for us, and as I see it, will continue to be. Some of the drivers for that, I\u2019ll just touch upon some parts of the portfolio. If you look at our EU business, where we\u2019re the vast majority of trading that\u2019s happening there, we continue to see new participants coming in, both financial players and commercial players, because new sectors are being captured in government mandates around who needs to pay attention to a carbon price signal, and there is the potential that areas like marine, roads, and buildings all get captured going forward into this, so that\u2019s a potential tailwind for more people needing to pay attention to our markets. You also have in the EU the concept of free allowance thresholds, where if you\u2019re under a certain threshold, you don\u2019t need to necessarily pay attention to carbon price signals. There is momentum behind lowering those free allowance thresholds, which thus could capture some of the major heavy industrial sectors that are currently not captured there, so that again leads to more commercials coming into the marketplace. In the U.S., again we\u2019re a significant, very significant lead in our business there, and there the big trend is new states coming into the regional greenhouse gas initiative, so there\u2019s potential for more and more states coming into that, there\u2019s momentum behind that in some of these states, and that leads to more trading in our markets. You have--just recently I mentioned on the last call that we launched our new U.K. emissions trading scheme, so as a result of Brexit, one of the benefits we got is that the U.K. decided to set up their own emissions trading scheme, they selected us to do that, we launched it, and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it\u2019s been a very, very successful launch.  Then you have new geographies around the world, so you have a trend within Asia Pacific where there\u2019s the potential for more and more adoption of these, and given the significant lead we have in creating these markets on behalf of governments and market participants to create that market-based pricing mechanism, we\u2019re heavily engaged in all of those conversations. Given that we are the most transparent way to price, put a market-based mechanism to price carbon, we\u2019ve also developed alongside our ICE fixed income and data services business a global carbon index, which is using the prices coming out of our marketplaces to create a very transparent way to look at both global as well as regional price trends within the carbon markets. Warren Gardiner : Hey Alex, it\u2019s Warren. Just to answer your question on this contribution to our revenues, volumes in that environmental complex, it\u2019s been about 2%, 3% of the energy volumes, but to your point, correctly, it\u2019s a higher capture rate, so revenues there are actually closer to about 10% of our energy revenues. Alex Blostein : Got it, great. Thanks.  Just as a follow-up, maybe a little bit of a bigger picture question for you guys, but the stock has obviously lagged and the multiple is now at a pretty meaningful discount to a number of your peer groups, and there\u2019s obviously a number of peer groups there, so across potentially all of them. I appreciate the point that ICE is looking to sell a stake in Euroclear, but are there opportunities to further prune the portfolio more aggressively, maybe selling businesses that are not meeting your growth thresholds in order to de-lever faster and maybe begin a more aggressive share repurchase plan? Benjamin Jackson : That\u2019s a great question. To a certain degree, that\u2019s what you saw us do. Our decision to sell our Coinbase stake was really about us being able to de-lever so that we could get back to a position where we can buy back shares, return capital to shareholders, which has you know has been our historical trend, so yes is the answer. We\u2019re always looking at our portfolio. I think in our industry, there\u2019s a lot of mergers and acquisitions that happen but very few of our peers really think about dispositions, and we do, as you know. We\u2019ve at one time owned the French, Dutch, Belgian, Portuguese stock exchange, we\u2019ve owned various analytic businesses, obviously we own some minority stakes in businesses, and so we\u2019re constantly thinking about our return on invested capital and how to best deploy it. As I think you are aware, we always look at our own view of the value of our shares, and to the extent that the best place for us to deploy capital is in returning it to shareholders via share buybacks, we aggressively do that. Alex Blostein : Great, thanks so much. Operator : As a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press star then one, and in the interests of time, if you would like to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question and if you have a follow-up, re-enter the queue. The next question will come from Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead. Alex Kramm : Yes hey, good morning everyone. Just maybe on the index business, thanks for the--I think there are new disclosures in terms of the ASV there. I know it\u2019s small in the context of the company and the segment, and obviously small relative to a lot of the other bigger index players, but Lynn, can you maybe help us with the revenue model and how that business breaks down? Some of your competitors obviously help us with how much is driven by EPS and asset base fees, how much is data, which I know in fixed income is important, and maybe even some opportunities around derivatives trading which maybe could materialize over time, so just help us a little bit how that business breaks down and where you see most of the opportunities. Is it just a play on ETFs or are there other bigger opportunities that you can monetize in multiple ways? Lynn Martin : Yes, thanks for the question, Alex. It\u2019s a great question. I think we see the opportunity for indices in multiple areas, particularly in fixed income. The indexation opportunity could be anywhere from acquiring our data, acquiring data subscriptions, allowing firms to make their own custom indices, giving us the opportunity to calculate those indices to provide intra-day snapshots for those indices or real-time versions of those indices, provide analytics, but also provide benchmarks. Obviously the ETFs that I mentioned in my prepared remarks that has selected us as their destination for transition business, selected us from a benchmarking perspective. But in fixed income, increasingly firms are also looking at our high quality underlying data, the fact that we\u2019re able to publish that data on a real-time basis which allows them to manage the real-time risks of the fixed income ETF market, so from our perspective we think there\u2019s opportunity across the spectrum, not just on the ETF AUM side but also on the underlying data side, as well as the services around it like our custom index tool. Warren Gardiner : Alex, it\u2019s Warren. In terms of the revenue mix, it\u2019s similar to what you\u2019re familiar with at peers in that it\u2019s a mix of the subscription fees and then asset-based fees that are based off of those ETFs. I think if you think about some of the growth that we\u2019ve seen there, it\u2019s been all of that, but I think the ETF side of that has been where we\u2019ve been leading in terms of the growth. Hopefully that helps you understand the mix a little bit more. Operator : The next question will come from Brian Bedell with Deutsch Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Great, thanks. Good morning. Two questions. I\u2019ll get back in the queue for the second one, but just wanted to touch on energy - it\u2019s sort of a longer term question for either Ben or Jeff. As the market slowly transitions to cleaner energy and environmental products, how do you see that longer term transition playing out in your overall volumes versus your more traditional energy products, so this would be both for nat gas, clean energy, and the environmental suite. I appreciate, Warren, that you said the RPCs are much higher on the environmental side, so that sounds like it will be a smoother transition from a revenue perspective, but just to get your thoughts on how many years you think it would take for the environmental and clean energy suite to match the core energy franchise, if that\u2019s possible speculation to make? Benjamin Jackson : Thanks Brian, this is Ben. I\u2019ll take this one. When you think about our portfolio, and it was threaded through your question there, I think you appreciate the fact that we\u2019ve built the most diversified platform that there is on the planet to help customers really go through this energy transition. We provide products, everything from coal to oil to natural gas to LNG and to the environmental markets, and in all those sectors we are the lead provider of services, helping customers within each of those segments but then also as they\u2019re transitioning towards a cleaner environment and cleaner fuels, helping them along that journey to manage their exposure to price risk. We\u2019re seeing underneath--you know, each one of those segments, we\u2019re still seeing a lot of demand for new products. You take, for example, just what\u2019s happened in oil - we\u2019ve had a ton of innovation that\u2019s happened in oil to help the Middle East and Asia Pacific commercial customers, where we were selected to launch the Murban Crude Oil Contract to enable users to be able to have a better price mechanism for pricing Middle Eastern oil going to Asia. You have the recent development that we announced with the Midland WTI American Gulf Coast Crude Contract that\u2019s being launched with two huge commercial partners in Magellan and Enterprise. It\u2019ll be launched early next year to provide a much better way to price WTI Midland crude that\u2019s at Houston and not constrained by the infrastructure constraints that are in and around Cushing.  You also see--you may have seen a recent consultation came out in the industry by us as well as our partners in S&P Platts to look at further evolution of the Brent contract and adding new sources of crude, such as Johan Sverdrup, and very importantly the potential for WTI Midland-basis Houston to be added into the Brent complex, further solidifying that as the global index for oil. I went through it in the prior question, all of the things that we\u2019re doing in the environmental complex to grow that, and we have a significant lead in our global natural gas and LNG franchise, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, that continues to grow year-over-year, so we feel we\u2019re very, very well positioned to help customers along this journey, and we\u2019ll continue to partner very closely with them to do so. Operator : The next question will come from Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy: Hey, good morning. While your listings revenues are growing, your growth rate has lagged that of your primary competitor. Can you speak to the current competitive dynamics in the listing space? Jeffrey Sprecher : Sure. Well first of all, the New York Stock Exchange floor was closed for a significant period of time during COVID, so part of the allure and the marketing of the New York Stock Exchange is the opportunity to physically be in our building and ring the bell, so we\u2019re very, very happy that Stacey and that team there navigated very difficult conditions on COVID to run the entirety of the business, and we\u2019re really pleased now that the floor is open. I believe we\u2019re doing 17 IPOs this week, just to give you a sense of how we\u2019re doing now that the business is back running in its physical form. Beyond that, we continue to be the leader of large capital raising. There\u2019s a cost in looking for listings. You know, you can look at the revenue side, that you\u2019re pointing out, but there\u2019s a cost, there\u2019s a marketing cost and we\u2019re very disciplined about our return on investment capital and how we deploy capital, part of the theme, I think, of some of the things that we\u2019ve talked to you about on this call, and we don\u2019t pursue listing where we don\u2019t see that the ROIC is there for our shareholders, so some of it is calculated on our part and some of it is really that we\u2019ve been at a bit of a disadvantage until the floor and the business itself was able to be back at full occupancy. Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy: Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Please go ahead. Kyle Voigt : Hi, good morning. Maybe if I can just touch on the credit trading market, there\u2019s been some thoughts that maybe you could really put the pieces together from IDC to the two retail trading businesses that you bought to ETF hub, and kind of build something for the institutional trading market within credit. Investors have obviously been focused on that because of electronification going in the market, which you\u2019ve been historically very good at doing electronifying markets.  I guess the question is really, is it too late, given the success of some of those competitors, to think about eventually launching something more towards institutional trading as being a material revenue driver for you, and why hasn\u2019t it been a bigger focus to launch in that market? We\u2019ve seen continued really strong revenue growth from some of your peers and even from some small players that weren\u2019t material three or four years ago in the market. Lynn Martin : Yes, that\u2019s a great question - this is Lynn. Thanks for asking the question. We continue--as I mentioned earlier, now that we\u2019ve put the execution business in the same vertical as the data business, and you have the macro forces of the market continuing to electronify data and the transparency that data provides, particularly on a near real-time basis, is going to be a key driver of that electronification. We\u2019ve made investments since we acquired the two retail businesses that we did in uniting the technology associated with those businesses, and where you\u2019re starting to see the fruits of our labor in penetrating the institutional market is really the portfolio trading activity that you\u2019ve seen more meaningfully pick up, starting towards the end of Q4 last year and then throughout this year. That leverages our new technology, that leverages our data assets, and that\u2019s very much institutional driven, and we\u2019re seeing increasing demand for those services as portfolio auctions continue to make up a larger portion of the trace prints that go through every day. That\u2019s really where we see the opportunity and the start of the opportunity to bring together the technology that we\u2019ve built and the data assets that are continuing to deliver double-digit growth around the electronification of this asset class. Operator : The next question will come from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Michael Cyprys : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask on the mortgage side, as you\u2019re digitizing mortgage workflows. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about how much of that is in the cloud and some of the vendors that you\u2019re using there, versus what you guys are in-sourcing. Then more longer term as you\u2019re looking out, what\u2019s the potential to migrate the mortgage workflows over to a block chain? What sort of opportunity is that, what would that entail, how easy of a lift or not would that be to that do that? Benjamin Jackson : Thanks Michael, this is Ben. The business has, even before we acquired it, has had a strategy for the loan origination side of the business to move more and more cloud-oriented, and that\u2019s one of the things that Jeff and I have mentioned on prior calls gave us conviction in doing the deal, is they had made some substantial investments that have moved the business to the cloud. If you look at other parts of our overall mortgage origination network, everything from the point of sale to the manufacturing process that I was just talking about, then all the way through to closing in the secondary, most of the aspects of that are cloud-oriented. We have a mix of some third party service providers that are providing some of the infrastructure in there, and we also have major data centers ourselves that are hosting pieces of this. Our strategy is definitely to move more and more in that direction. We already have moved for significant parts of the business to that, and it\u2019s an area that we\u2019re going to continue to invest. Quite frankly, it\u2019s one of the things that is leading to a lot of the success that we\u2019ve had in sales that I\u2019ve mentioned in the second half of last year and the first half of this year, exceeding our models, is that if you look across our entire mortgage ecosystem, we\u2019re providing a service somewhere along our network and our cloud-based network, we\u2019re providing at least a service to almost every single mortgage participant that\u2019s out there, so the ability to engage with them, show them the value we can provide on our network gives us a great platform to then go ahead and cross-sell other services, which is really fueling a lot of the additional growth that we\u2019ve seen. Jeffrey Sprecher : I\u2019ll just mention on the block chain, one of the dilemmas, if you will, for the mortgage industry is that it\u2019s highly regulated and there\u2019s a tremendous amount of data required to write a mortgage, and that data for regulatory purposes does need to be stored for some period of time and be accessible to third parties to audit. Right now, probably the best--and a lot of that is still analog and paper-based and is moving digital, and we\u2019re driving much of that digital adoption. But right now, probably the best use of the block chain would just be to put a hash as to where those records are located to make it easier for third parties to know at all times where the records lie, as opposed to using the block chain to store those records, which still are in the early stages of moving to the cloud, as Ben said. Operator : The next question will come from Simon Clinch with Atlantic Equities. Please go ahead. Simon Clinch : Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could just dig a little deeper on the recurring--well actually, for the mortgage technology business overall, the recurring revenue stream is performing really nicely, and I was wondering if you could talk about the market share you have on the loan origination side and how that feeds through to that recurring stream over time, but also how you\u2019re progressing along with your pipeline of additional services that you\u2019re going to be layering on top to increase that revenue per loan, that should help us sort of model this business over the next few years when we\u2019re looking at--on that kind of per-loan basis. Benjamin Jackson : Thanks for the question, Simon. This is Ben again. As I mentioned in the first question that was asked, we have--since acquiring the business have had a very concentrated effort on how do we focus on that recurring revenue stream, how do we look at that subscription base, and really start to, where we can in certain parts of the business, shift revenue more towards subscription, especially as you\u2019re in this high volume environment that we\u2019ve been in and it\u2019s a great time to do that, to shift it more towards subscription, and for some parts of the business less towards transaction. That\u2019s more oriented towards the loan origination side and that AIQ business, so in those two parts of the business, those are areas where we have had a concentrated effort of moving customers in that direction. To give you an example, at that AIQ business on the data and analytics side, it historically was 100% transaction oriented, and we have moved it very significantly towards subscription revenue, both for every new customer that comes on the platform as well as renewals that are coming on.  We are seeing--you know, to the answer of market share, we\u2019re seeing record sales continue. As I mentioned multiple times, the second half of last year was a record and Q1 and Q2 have exceeded our expectations - all that is continuing to gain market share for us and for the business. As we implement customers, that feeds into new subscription revenue, that feeds into part of the beat that we had this past quarter as well as shifting more of the mix towards subscription. The other side of it is there are certain parts of the business that are transaction oriented and we are continuing to innovate new solutions and new opportunities to capture new transactional revenue that\u2019s not happened before, even for us or for the industry. An example of that is I mentioned last quarter we\u2019d be launching our hybrid eClose - well, we\u2019ve gone ahead and launched that, so that\u2019s a complete digital closing room that interconnects the consumer to the lender to the settlement agent, so that all documents, all collaboration, all communication and the entire closing process can be done digitally. We just launched this, and we already have 55 customers out of our 2,000 in the implementation process. As those get implemented, that will be new transaction revenue that will be coming through to us, so that\u2019s another example. Another example that Jeff had mentioned in his prepared remarks is the interconnectivity that we see between data on the mortgage side of the business flowing through to our fixed income and data services business, where we\u2019re taking transaction data out of the mortgage side of our business to help enhance and improve our mortgage-backed securities prepayment and valuation models, where we are a leader in providing that and further enhancing those models with real transactional data that hasn\u2019t happened before. Operator : The next question will come from Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead. Alex Kramm : Yes, thanks for letting me squeeze in a couple follow-ups here. Just on the mortgage side, two things, actually. One, on the cost side, appreciate that obviously you\u2019re building a business for the long term and you\u2019re shifting to more recurring, as you just mentioned, but clearly you\u2019ve seen the transactional side turn a little bit, so just wondering to what degree there are actually potential offsets that you\u2019re thinking about as maybe those transactional revenues come down. Is there something you can do on the expense side, or is that going to continue to grow as you invest? Then for Jeff, since you just--we talked about this interconnectivity between the different businesses, on the mortgage side, Joe at your mortgage industry conference a few months ago made an off-the-cuff remark that you\u2019re going to be working together closely and maybe there\u2019s room for mortgage trading down the line with your exchange business. Just wondering to what degree is this just a long term dream, or if there\u2019s actually something behind the scenes that you\u2019re already working on and what the opportunity set could be there. Thank you. Warren Gardiner : Thanks Alex, it\u2019s Warren. I\u2019ll hit on your expense question quickly first. There is a degree of variable expenses within that business, but I think the way you want to be thinking about this is, look - this isn\u2019t about a second half refi environment, this is about a 10-year growth opportunity for us, where we think we can double revenues over the next 10 years or so, so we\u2019re going to invest through however that cycle plays out. If it does play out, we\u2019re going to be investing through it - that was part of the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year, where we said about $40 million to $45 million of incremental investment. I think you\u2019ll see that start to slowly step up as we move through the year, and that\u2019s going as planned. That\u2019s all part of the planned investments that we\u2019ve made and we\u2019ve communicated to you guys. But I think one point too just to make there on that as well is that one of the benefits here that Ellie Mae and ICE mortgage technology has as being part of the larger ICE platform is just the diversity that ICE brings to them. As Jeff said in his prepared remarks, it\u2019s an all-weather stock, and so as maybe a mortgage cycle plays out, you\u2019ve got other things in other areas of the business doing well, so it really gives us the ability to invest through those cycles, maybe where a standalone competitor or peer wouldn\u2019t be able to do that, and ultimately that puts us in a better place at the other end of things. Again, it\u2019s about a 10-year opportunity against a $10 billion TAM, where we\u2019re only about 10% of that today, so you should expect us to continue to invest in that business as we kind of move through the next couple quarters. Jeffrey Sprecher : And regarding future ideas, Joe, who you mentioned, has joined our management committee, which also contains all the people that you\u2019ve heard from on this call, and we run the business collaboratively so that we can work on this interconnectivity. What you\u2019ve heard Ben talk about on this call is really hooking up what we would consider the cash market in a traditional market - you know, it\u2019s the origination market of actually producing a mortgage for a consumer, and for the first time now we\u2019ve announced that we\u2019re hooking that to the secondary market through Lynn\u2019s business of taking that data to help with mortgage-backed securities. Our sense is that the mortgage market, while it is regulated, is likely to continue to get more government attention as it becomes more transparent. It\u2019s largely for many people in government a mechanism for wealth creation in the sense of people building equity in a home. It\u2019s also interest rate sensitive, as a number of the questions have alluded to here, and there are maybe opportunities for government to influence or touch interest rates for certain segments of our society, and as the data and the transparency of where houses are being bought and refinanced and where wealth is being created, as that becomes more transparent, we really believe that the business is going to continue to evolve around government policy, and that is going to make its way, trickle its way into the secondary trading market. We will be uniquely positioned with data and information about the changes that are going on in the cash market to help influence that secondary market, and it does it mean we\u2019ll host one of those or use other assets? Potentially, that\u2019s part of why we wanted to get into this ecosystem, and it\u2019s part of our goal to build an all-weather company that will perform in every environment. Operator : This will conclude today\u2019s question and answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jeff Sprecher for any closing remarks. Jeffrey Sprecher : Well thank you, Shawn, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We\u2019ll look forward to updating you again soon as we continue to execute on these really interesting and exciting growth opportunities that we laid out for you today. Otherwise, I hope you\u2019ll have a great day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation, and you may now disconnect.",

After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note, participants is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mary Caroline O'Neal, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Mary Caroline O'Neal: Good morning. ICE's third quarter 2021 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived, and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2020 Form 10-K, third quarter Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP terms in the earnings materials. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, references to revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain items. With us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Warren Gardiner, Chief Financial Officer; Ben Jackson, President; and Lynn Martin, President of Fixed Income and Data Services. I'll now turn the call over to Warren. Warren Gardiner : Thanks, MC. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our third quarter results. Adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.30, up 34% year-over-year, marking the best third quarter in our company's history. Net revenues totaled a record $1.8 billion, and on a pro forma basis, increased 11% versus last year, with all three of our business segments contributing to the strong year-over-year growth. Total transaction revenues grew 13%, while total recurring revenues, which accounted for nearly half of our business, increased by 10%. Third quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $755 million, including $35 million related to Bakkt, which after successfully completing its merger with Victory Park recently began trading on the NYSE. Adjusting for Bakkt, third quarter operating expenses would have been $720 million, in the middle of our guidance range, while our adjusted operating margin would have been 60%, up over 100 basis points year-over-year. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted operating expenses to be between $737 million to $747 million. Relative to the full year outlook provided on our second quarter call, the fourth quarter is now expected to include approximately $10 million related to the Bakkt's sub period and $10 million to $15 million of performance-related compensation as we expect to reward our employees for their contribution to the strong results we are once again on track to achieve in 2021. Record year-to-date free cash flow has totaled nearly $2 billion. These strong cash flows along with the divestment of our $1.2 billion stake in Coinbase has enabled us to reduce leverage to under 3.25 times at the end of September, nearly a full year ahead of schedule. As a result, we expect to resume share repurchases, including up to $250 million in this year's fourth quarter. We anticipate updating you on our 2022 capital return plans early next year. In addition, we announced in October that we have agreed to sell our stake in Euroclear for \u20ac709 million, or approximately $820 million. We expect to determine the use of Euroclear proceeds as we approach closing, which we expect will be -- will occur in 2022. Now let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Third quarter net revenues totaled $959 million, an increase of 16% year-over-year. This strong performance was driven by a 30% increase in our interest rate business and a 38% increase in our energy revenues, including 34% increase in our oil complex, a 73% increase in European natural gas revenues and a 72% increase in revenues related to global environmental products. Importantly, total open interest, which we believe to be the best indicator of long-term growth, is up 18% versus the end of last year, including 11% growth in energy and 28% growth across our financial futures and options complex. Recurring revenues, which include our exchange data services and NYSE listings increased 6% year-over-year, including 10% growth in our Listings business. This acceleration in growth was driven by an increasing number of operating company IPOs choosing the NYSE, particularly in the technology and consumer sectors. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect recurring revenues in our Exchange segment to be between $330 million and $335 million. Turning now to Slide 6. I'll discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services segment. Third quarter revenues totaled $477 million, a 6% increase versus a year ago. Recurring revenue growth, which accounted for nearly 90% of segment revenues, also grew 6% in the quarter. Within recurring revenues, our fixed income data and analytics business increased by 5% year-over-year, including another double-digit growth in our index franchise, while other data and network services grew 9%, driven by continued customer demand for additional network capacity. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect that our recurring revenues will improve sequentially to a range of $415 million to $420 million, and that full year revenue growth will be approximately 6%, at the high end of our guidance range. Let's go next to Slide 7, where I will discuss our Mortgage Technology segment. Please note that my comments on revenue growth are on a pro forma basis. Despite a double-digit decline in industry origination volumes, our mortgage technology business grew 7% year-over-year and achieved record revenues of $366 million. While third quarter transaction revenues declined slightly, they were more than offset by a 33% growth in our recurring revenues, which at $143 million once again exceeded the high end of our guidance range and accounted for nearly 40% of total segment revenues. Our outperformance relative to industry trends continues to be driven by increased customer adoption of digital tools across the workflow. While these secular growth trends have been a clear tailwind for our recurring revenues, there is also opportunity to drive accelerating adoption across our transaction-based businesses, such as our Closing Solutions, where revenue increased by 30% in the third quarter. Looking to the fourth quarter guidance, we expect that recurring revenues will once again grow sequentially and be in a range of $147 million to $152 million. At the midpoint, this represents growth of approximately 25% year-over-year, which is on top of 20% growth achieved in last year's third quarter. In summary, we once again had strong contributions from each of our businesses and across the asset classes in which we operate. We delivered double-digit growth in revenue, operating income and earnings per share. We also generated strong cash flows, reduced leverage to under 3.25 time, announced the divestment of our stake in Euroclear and successfully took back public on the NYSE. As we look to the end of the year into 2022, we remain focused on meeting the needs of our customers, continuing to drive growth and create value for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Ben. Ben Jackson : Thank you, Warren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 8. Our strong third quarter results were driven in part by interest rate volatility, global energy supply shortages and the continued adoption of our mortgage technology even amidst a decline in origination volumes. But more importantly, underpinning that performance are long-term secular tailwinds that will continue to drive growth across asset classes in macroeconomic environments. And with data and technology at our core, we have strategically positioned the business to benefit from these tailwinds across our platform. In energy, the globalization of natural gas and the evolution to cleaner energy are trends that we began investing in over a decade ago. And today, cleaner energy sources, including global natural gas and environmentals, make up approximately 40% of our energy revenues and have grown 12% on average over the past five years. With the rise of LNG, natural gas markets are becoming more global in nature. In our European gas benchmark, TTF is emerging as the global gas benchmark. Revenues in our TTF markets have grown 38% on average over the last five years, including 84% growth in the third quarter.  The supply shortages and price volatility that we saw in the third quarter are a peek into the future of what the energy transition could look like. Energy consumption is expected to double over the next 30 years, yet carbon emissions are expected to be reduced by half. This imbalance in supply and demand will introduce additional complexity and volatility to energy markets, which will drive greater demand for our risk management. Our global environmental markets, alongside our global oil, gas and power markets provide the critical price transparency across the energy spectrum that will enable participants to navigate this evolution. Complementary addition to the risk management that our technology provides is our growing suite of associated data products. Leveraging our leading environmental markets, we built a suite of carbon indices, which allow global investors to access market-based carbon prices through a single investment instrument. And today, there are a growing number of ETFs benchmarking to our carbon indices and environmental markets. Turning now to fixed income. The electronification of fixed income is a data-driven trend. We recognized this in 2015 when we acquired IDC and continue to invest and innovate in data and technology to further enable this trend. Our leading evaluated prices provide critical price transparency for nearly 3 million securities daily. By combining our proprietary pricing data with our comprehensive reference data, we've built innovative tools and analytics that will facilitate the continued electronification and automation of the fixed income markets. Solutions like our continuous evaluated pricing, best execution and liquidity indicators, for example, provide pre-trade transparency needed to determine fair value. We also see the electronification of fixed income within the ETF ecosystem. Our quality pricing and reference data, combined with four years of history serves as the foundation of our growing index business. We not only offer benchmark indices, but also calculation services, analytics and the unique solutions like our custom indexes. By servicing the entire ETF ecosystem through data and technology, we've been able to grow our index business double-digits for the past four years. And finally, turning to our mortgage business. In the third quarter, we were once again able to grow our revenues even with industry volumes down double-digits. This continued outperformance is a result of executing against our strategy of leveraging our mission-critical technology and data expertise to accelerate the analog-to-digital conversion happening in the industry. Part of that strategy is intentionally shifting more business to recurring revenue, particularly within our origination technology and data and analytics business. While we only recently began this transition, we've already seen strong client adoption. Another opportunity that we\u2019re executing on today is in our closing solutions. The demand for automation in the closing of a real estate transaction is increasing. We see this evidenced by the continued onboarding of new customers to our electronic closing room, and hybrid solution that we launched in the second quarter. This month, we further advanced the automation of our eClose solution, which can save lenders hundreds of dollars per loan by leveraging additional technology and automation by adding eNote and eVaults. Our comprehensive offering and the efficiencies that it delivers, positions us well to execute on what we believe to be a $1 billion opportunity. Within Data and Analytics, our AIQ solution leverages AI, machine learning and proprietary data from our origination platform to automate the steps in the loan manufacturing process. This automation could save lenders thousands of dollars per loan by reducing manufacturing time and complexity. Today, only a fraction of mortgage technology customers take our AIQ solution, and we continue to have strong sales success cross-selling to existing customers even if they're not on our loan origination system, including one of the largest depositories in the US. And while still an early opportunity at under $100 million in revenue today, the efficiencies that our data analytics provide position us well to continue executing against what we think is a $4 billion opportunity. Flywheel effect that our leading technology and data provides combined with the cross-sell that our broad connectivity offers generates an array of opportunities for us to grow a business that at $1.4 billion today is only a fraction of the $10 billion opportunity. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Sprecher : Thank you, Ben, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 9. The third quarter extends our track record of growth. We once again grew revenues, grew adjusted operating income and grew adjusted earnings per share with strong growth from all business segments across asset classes, and amidst a dynamic macro environment. These results are a testament to the strength of our business model, positioning the company at the center of some of the largest markets undergoing an analog-to-digital conversion, and which together make ICE an all-weather name that generates growth on top of growth. The diversity of our platform positions us to benefit not only from near-term cyclical events, but also longer-term secular growth trends. We've expanded into new asset classes, growing our addressable market and broadened our expertise, making our network significant and providing the opportunity to unlock additional growth by collaborating across businesses. We recently announced another new product from the collaboration between ICE Data Services and ICE Mortgage Technology, called the ICE Rate Lock Indices. Leveraging anonymized and aggregated data from ICE Mortgage Technologies leading origination platform, this suite of indices provides a more comprehensive, accurate and timely reflection of residential mortgage rates. Building on this innovation, like we've done in other asset classes, these indices provide an opportunity to create additional products like rich analytics and better pricing tools for lenders. The opportunity to turn raw, unstructured data into actionable insights abounds across our business. By taking alternative data sets and marrying them with our proprietary data, we've built solutions that offer unique insight into the market. Our climate analytics, for example, leverage our strength in the fixed income market with third-party geospatial data to help market participants better manage climate risk as a part of their overall investing and risk management processes. As ESG is increasingly becoming a component of investment portfolios, our technology and data expertise positions us well to deliver solutions that meet these evolving customer needs. We have strategically assembled a portfolio to drive growth across asset classes and macro environments, and part of this strategy is capturing value by thoughtfully repositioning businesses. This year alone, we harvested our gain in Coinbase, announced an agreement to do the same with our stake in Euroclear, and unlocked Bakkt via our New York Stock Exchange listing. These transactions expose billions of dollars in value creation and position us well to return capital to shareholders while continuing to invest for our future growth. It's collaborative efforts, innovative solutions and strategic capital allocation like this that have driven our growth for the past 20 years and which lay the foundation for continued growth well into the future. Before I end my prepared remarks, I'd like to thank our customers for their business and their trust in the quarter. And I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contributions to the best third quarter in our company's history, topped only by our record quarter earlier this year. I'll now turn the call back to our moderator, Dania, to conduct a question-and-answer session, which will run until 9 : 30 Eastern Time. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session.  The first question we have is from Richard Repetto from Piper Sandler. Richard Repetto : Good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Warren. Can you hear me? Jeff Sprecher : Yes, we can hear you clear. Richard Repetto : Sorry, So my one question, Jeff, is the Mortgage Technology business, I think, surprised a lot of people. And when you zone in the closing, and you addressed a fair amount of it in the prepared remarks. But I'm just trying to understand the Closing Solutions and what are the new tools and trying to get better insight. It looked like that segment of the mortgage tech grew 28% or $19 million in a market that, at least incrementally, gets -- seemed to get soft. Jeff Sprecher : Yes. Let me ask Ben to address that since he manages that business for us. Ben Jackson : Hi, Rich, thanks for the question. And -- in summary, when it's part of the thesis we had in doing the overall deal is that we saw a long-term secular trend here for people to want to automate and digitize the mortgage process, to continue to work on condensing the amount of time it takes to close on a real estate transaction. And if you look under the covers of that Closing Solutions business, this is a business that's going to be very transaction-oriented. A lot of the costs associated to it actually go on the actual closing statement of the client themselves. So you're going to see that this is one of the businesses that's going to be heavily transaction-oriented. And if you look at the components underneath it, they're really driving the growth. First part goes back to an acquisition we did a number of years ago, which is the Simplifile business. This is a business that electronic -- does the electronic recording at the county of all the closing documents associated to a real estate transaction. In this COVID environment we saw, a year ago, the number of documents that are being recorded in the counties moving more and more away from paper and towards digitization and using our rails to do so, and we continue to see that. So Simplifile is an input into that growth. The second component there is a business that we've talked about many times, which is a business called MERS. We have a new bundled service offering there that takes a number of bespoke services that we had within MERS. So the registration of the loan itself, the registration of an e-note, which we continue to see e-notes being adopted more and more through the industry, as well as lifetime servicing transfers, all being -- we bundled that all into one complete offering for our clients. And then the third area that we've talked about on prior calls is the launch of eClose, which was really enabled by the combination of the expertise we have with MERS, Simplifile and the Ellie Mae business. And we combined that origination network that Ellie Mae has with the settlement agent network that the Simplifile business has. We've launched our eClose offering in the second quarter. We've enhanced that offering with our own proprietary e-signing capabilities in the third quarter. And then just this month, we launched our own proprietary eNote as part of our loan origination document set, as well as eVault. And we're continuing to see customers adopt those solutions. I mentioned on the last call, we had 55 customers going through implementation. We now have 76 that are adopting it. And as that continues to ramp, I see that as another area that's going to continue to fuel growth in the closing line item, which is really enabling us to take a business that, 12 months ago, was a $200 million business to now if you look at the trailing 12 months, it's a $300 million business, continuing to go after that $1 billion TAM that we outlined. Richard Repetto : Thank you. Very helpful. And I don't want to jinx you, Jeff, but you get a lot of things going right at this time, it appears. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question we have is from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Ken Worthington : Hi. Good morning. On Bakkt, that has had a good run here. And while ICE is a founder owner, my impression is Bakkt seems to be more of a financial than strategic investment at this point. I guess, maybe first, is that the correct view? And if so, what is the intent for that investment? And how do you see the utilization or investment of the proceeds given the significant value creation we've seen here, even in recent weeks? Jeff Sprecher : Yes. Well, first of all, and I think -- we'd like to position ourselves where there are analog to digital conversions, and there's an analog-to-digital conversion going on in the wallet. When I was a kid, I had a carried around a leather wallet in my pocket, and children today may never own a leather wallet. And so that analog-to-digital conversion is something that we wanted to be a part of. I think we decided to create Bakkt as a separate brand and a separate entity because a lot of our investors seem to not see the coalescence of institutional and retail coming together. As access is increased through digital tools, and you can see it in the US equity markets, there's less distinction between a retail order and an institutional order, for example. And so that same convergence is happening across all businesses. And we were a little bit concerned that our investor base wouldn't appreciate that we could both be an institutional network provider and also a retail network provider. And so we decided to give the company a separate brand. And it was -- we just didn't feel like it was being appreciated inside of ICE and so we decided to give it a separate capital structure on the New York Stock Exchange. Other than that, Bakkt will be doing its own earnings calls now as a public company. I'm no longer on the board. And so I don't want to ever speak for the company, going forward. But I will tell you that we do believe there's value creation in analog-to-digital conversions, and we're trying to place value there around the business. And that's part of why I see us as being an all-weather name that can grow on top of growth. We're locked up in the company as part of the IPO. We actually invested additionally as part of the spin. And so we're very, very high on that company and want to give it every opportunity to demonstrate its value to the market. Ken Worthington : Thanks. Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you sir. The next question we have is from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Okay. Great. Thanks. Good morning folks. Just come back to the mortgage side and the third quarter performance there, again, exceptionally strong. I appreciate the answer to Rich's question on that. But if you -- if, Ben, you can talk about maybe parsing a little bit of the strong results between what you think are market share gains versus a lot of this initial traction of the products that you mentioned. And the take-up of those products in the third quarter is, obviously there's, headwinds on origination and repurchase and then refinance volumes. But should we be thinking of this third quarter as a pretty good base, especially in closing solutions to forecast from, on the transactional side? Ben Jackson : Thanks, Brian. I'll try to go through some of the components of what we saw that drove that growth. And as we highlighted, the business grew double digits year-over-year -- or sorry -- so the business grew 7% year-over-year. And with the backdrop of a decline in industry volumes being up double-digit. We also grew the business 8% sequentially, if you look at it from second quarter to third quarter against a volume environment that industry estimates would have down double digits as well. And if you look at each of the line items of what's happening there, you'll see that we outperformed not only in the aggregate, but also in each line item, what that transaction -- what that overall transaction environment was. In the origination line item, what you see there that I outlined in the last quarter is that -- and it was in our prepared remarks again today, is that part of our customs doing the deal is that we could take certain parts of the revenue base here and move it more and more towards subscription and take some of the volatility out of it. And the origination line item is one in particular that we are doing that with. And we've only done that with a very small percentage of the customer base. The average client is a customer and is under contract for four to five years. And we just started this year with a small percentage of the client base. We've had a great pickup in customers being open to moving more towards subscription. So I see we have a long runway of that. The other thing that's going on in that origination line is we're continuing to add more customers we're gaining more market share  And as we implement those customers, those are new loans that are running through our system that we are getting some transaction volume that we never saw before, that's offsetting some of the headwinds that you'd see in that transaction environment. The second line item, data and analytics, it's the exact same story. We're taking a business -- so this is the automation of the underwrite process through our AI tools. This is a business that was almost 100% transaction. Under the covers, we've been moving it more and more towards subscription. We're going to continue to do so, and we're having incredible success cross-selling this to clients. It does take a little bit longer to implement customers on this solution because you're automating and deeply embedding your solutions into very complicated workflow in each of these businesses as you're automating underwriting processes. But we have a number of customers that are going live on the platform that we've sold. We continue to have great sales success. And we have a number continuing to go through implementation. So that's continuing to grow and offset any transaction issues you see there. And then on the Closing Solutions side, this is where I unpacked in the first question, a lot of the new innovation that we have, a lot of the changes that we made. Simplifile continues to gain market share really versus paper. Our eClose solutions, our brand-new innovation that the industry hasn't seen before, and each time a customer is subscribing to whether it's using our e-closing room, they're using our document set, they're using our e-closing room, they're using our document set, they're using our e-note, they're using our vault, they can use either a component of those services or all of them. And each time they do that, we're getting incremental revenue on every transaction that's using that. And it's all greenfield. And there's very little competition in this space because of the unique position we've been in to build all those. Brian Bedell : That\u2019s great color. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. The next question we have is from Kyle Voigt from KBW. Kyle Voigt : Great. Thank you. Good morning. If I could just follow up actually on the past -- the last question. Just regarding the move to subscription on the origination side, specifically. You said a small amount of those customers have migrated to subscription. Can you help quantify that? Is that sub-10% of the customers or any numbers around that? And can you just talk about the pricing structure? Because I thought the recurring revenues on the origination side previously were really just fee minimums on volumes. But it sounds like maybe this is a bit different in terms of fee structure. So can you just kind of go over that and what the strategy is in terms of migrating these customers? Thank you. Jeff Sprecher : So thanks, Kyle. So on the -- so on move to subscription to answer the first part of how much -- how many of the customers have we done it with, it's well less than 10%. So it's a very small percentage of the customer base that we've been able to do this with. As you can imagine, now is a good time to actually be engaging with customers to make this transition towards subscription. Because you're in a high-volume environment, customers are in this high-volume environment, they want to adopt more automation. They want to be able to continue to automate and be as efficient as possible against any other competition. So they're continuing to add on more and more of our services. So when we go and engage in clients in this negotiation, we are willing to forgo some transaction revenue. But we're not foregoing all of it. We're just making it very open in our algorithm around, hey, if we're going to shift some to subscription, we are willing to give up some transaction, which is mostly the success fees on those transactions that we get. But we also remember the other transaction element that we do get is on our network. So any time a loan is coming on to our network and ordering services from third parties for the automation that we're providing there, we're collecting a fee for providing that benefit along those rails and that fee will continue as it is today. Kyle Voigt : And sorry, are those multiyear contracts with some sort of escalator in them? I'm just trying to understand the, I guess, the leverage as you continue to gain market share of origination volume, et cetera. I guess, are you taking away some of the upside by moving to subscription and just how do you view that balance? Thank you. Jeff Sprecher : Sure. So as I mentioned earlier in the commentary, the average customers on four, five year agreements, that's not changing. So you can -- and we just started this. So we just started doing this, this year, and we only did it with a subset of the customers that were actually going through renewal to really see what we learned in going through that and testing that our hypothesis, now theory, was right, and we've proven that. So we have a long runway to do this, and continue to feed more subscription revenue growth over time. In terms of are we taking away some of the upside, the way I see it is we're taking away some of the volatility in that line item. And where our upside is, is there's still a ton of new innovation that we're introducing to the marketplace between the e-close offerings that we have, that we've launched, between the automation of the underwrite and all the analyzers that we've been talking about on prior calls that we've been introducing to the marketplace. This is all brand-new innovation that is going to continue to drive transaction revenue growth in parallel to reducing the volatility and risk in some of the line items that we have, like origination, data and analytics. Kyle Voigt : It\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question we have is from Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. So I wanted to just talk about kind of capital allocation now that you've reached your targets. And resuming the buyback, was curious about kind of next year and kind of interim time period with the idea around M&A still being part of your strategy versus buybacks, and kind of the capital allocation priorities here in the near term, or kind of the next, kind of, start of next year as well? Warren Gardiner : Yeah. Thanks, Dan. It's Warren. So right. So yeah, at the end of the third quarter, we got to under 3.25 times. That was kind of our target to resume share buybacks that we set when we announced the Ellie Mae deal back in August of last year. And so we'll start about -- up to about $250 million this quarter. I think about that kind of being more of a partial buyback, because we do still need to get to three times eventually. And I think we're well on our way there. But -- so we'll do a bit of a balance, pay down of debt alongside these repurchases over the next quarter or so. But I think once -- thinking about next year, nothing's really changed in terms of capital return philosophy. I mean, it's the same -- it's going to be the same thing as pre-Ellie Mae where it's return -- all capital to shareholders that we don't need for investment or M&A to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. So I think you should expect us to be thinking about it that way. And the only thing really that has changed here is that we've continued to grow free cash flow organically and then, of course, added Ellie Mae, which as you obviously heard today and in the last couple of quarters seen that it's performing very well. So those would be the things that I'd be thinking about as you're kind of thinking about next year and capital return at the moment. Right now, we're kind of going through the 2022 budget process. So as we start to refine that, we'll be able to kind of give you guys a bit of an update in the next couple of quarters or so. Dan Fannon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question we have is from Chris Allen from Compass Point. Chris Allen : Hey, good morning, guys. I wonder if you get some more incremental color on the energy business. I appreciate the kind of long-term outlook. Maybe how you think about the business near term, the potential for the current environment to persist? Any color just in terms of the health of the customer base, when you're seeing new customers coming in. And maybe just on the LNG global opportunity, where you're seeing the biggest sources of uptake from a regional perspective? Jeff Sprecher : Thanks, Chris. So when you look at our energy business, and we've talked about this on several calls, one of the things I think that's come to light through this is that we are very different than any of the peers that are out there and that we've developed very deep liquid markets across the energy class spectrum. So whether it's coal, oil, gas, power, environmentals, we've invested heavily across that entire spectrum to give our customers the tools they need, to manage what we saw as a secular trend more than a decade ago of people moving towards cleaner fossil fuel such as natural gas, and towards environmental markets, carbon offset markets, compliance markets and the like. We made several acquisitions, climate exchange 10 years ago. We've been building out our global natural gas suite, and we have now a business that's substantially different than any of our peers. We continue to invest, as we talked about in prior quarters, our oil business, which is doing extraordinarily well with investments that we made in the launch of our Murban contract, that ICE Futures Abu Dhabi. We have a new contract in the Gulf Coast that's launching in the beginning of next year in partnership with several big physical players. And we're in the middle of a Brent consultation where Midland WTI may be added into the Brent basket. So you have a whole bunch of dynamics going on across this, and it's because customers know they need to manage their risk through this transition. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I think the environment that you've just seen, you've got to peek into what it's going to be for a long, long time. This energy transition is going to be very volatile. Everyone sees the secular trend where investments are pouring into renewable projects and projects such as coal are not getting invested in. And the fact is any energy supply source, I don't care what it is, is susceptible to supply chain events, weather events, for example. If you have wind turbines and the wind is not blowing, it's not really easy to transition back to a coal-fired plant to get power back on the grid. So I foresee that we're in for a long ride of volatility. And now more than ever, the exchanges and the risk management tools that we provide are extraordinarily valuable to our clients, and it's important to us that we continue to engage with them as much as we ever have to continue to innovate. Chris Allen : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question we have is from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Hi. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for the question. I was hoping maybe we could zoom out for a second. You guys provided a lot of details around the new segments. But if you look at ICE today, 50% of revenues comes from sort of recurring sustainable business. It's grown at 10% for the last couple of quarters organically. And your guidance for Q4 implies about 10% growth as well. So maybe just walk us through how you think about sustainability of that recurring revenue base and the growth algorithm that we could think about here on a multiyear basis? Thanks. Jeff Sprecher : Yes, it's a great question. And I think the one takeaway you should have is that, that has been an intentional evolution on behalf of the management team. We have been -- we started the company really being highly transaction-oriented, and have always wanted to have a bigger recurring growing base that we can rely on. Part of our thinking of becoming an all-weather name is finding these analog to digital market conversions, but also creating a portfolio of businesses that we operate that are durable in different environments. We really wanted to get into the mortgage space, and really worked for over 10 years to put ourselves in that space because it benefits from a low interest rate environment, generally speaking. We have other businesses like our interest rate futures and, to a certain degree, inflation-oriented products like commodities that tend to do better in high interest rate environments. And so, from a transaction standpoint, we wanted to be durable. We want to grow on top of growth and not be a name where people pile in when interest rates are going up and pile out when interest rates are going down. And so, the more that we feel like we can lock into growing and recurring revenue, it gives investors a basis to know that we're going to continue to pay a dividend, that we're going to have capital to reinvest in the business. And then, if we can have transaction businesses that, regardless of macro environment, can do well. It just feels like a company that an investor should own. And that has been the strategy that we've deployed here for -- I mean years now. And it's finally coming to fruition. And the mortgage business, as Ben has mentioned, we've passed our colleagues with let's try to -- to really build a durable subscription underpinning to a business that also has really interesting transaction opportunities because of changes in technology. And the same thing in emissions and in liquefied natural gas. I know you and I have talked for years about our thesis that the natural gas market would globalize and that there would be global benchmarks, not regional benchmarks. And so, a lot of these metrics that you see in your economic model have been incredibly intentional on our part over a long period of time. And it's great that in this quarter, as was mentioned earlier, everything came together at one time. Alex Blostein : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question we have is from Alex Kramm from UBS. Alex Kramm : Yeah. Hey, good morning, everyone. Just one quick follow-up on the mortgage side again. A lot of good qualitative detail, but I think what's missing a little bit is some more quantitative updates here. And I guess I know you don't give us any sort of numbers of mortgages that go in through your system a quarter, and I know a lot of investors are asking for that. But in absence of that, given that you're talking about a kind of like upsell, revenue upsell, sorry, maybe you can at least help us how much your revenue per mortgage has been changing over the last year or two? I mean, again, like if you're upselling, I guess, that revenue per mortgage should go up. So maybe some numbers you can put around that. And if you can decompose a little bit between pricing and certain new services that would be very helpful, too. So hopefully, you can give us a little something here. Jeff Sprecher : Yeah. Alex, there's a lot in that question. What I'll -- one area I can unpack here is when you dig into that, what's leading to our subscription growth. So that's one of the areas of our thesis is that we could move more and more towards subscription in certain parts of the business. And if you look at the components of what's fueling that, one is the very deliberate -- as customers are renewing, moving more and more towards subscription and the origination and the data and analytics line, that's one component. The second is new sales. And this is about market share gains. So we continue to have a lot of success in continuing to add new customers onto our platform and cross-selling services to our existing clients is really the third. So in that cross-selling, the way to think about it, there's opportunities for us to expand the footprint with our clients, with the existing services that they have. We have clients that are using us, for example, on the loan origination side and the correspondent channel, moving to add the retail channel onto that, adding services like our Maven compliance service or our AllRegs offering. All of those are heavily subscription oriented, so we have a concerted effort to cross-sell. And then the fourth is price. And our algorithm when we did the deal and our hypothesis is that on the subscription revenue growth, which is a big component of what we think is required to really hit that 8% to 10% long-term guide, that over that long period of time, each of those elements, the renewals, new sales, cross-selling and price, that will be pretty much an equal distribution across those three that you'll see over a long period of time is what's going to fuel that sustained subscription growth. So that's -- that's the area I'd highlight. There's -- on the transaction area, I mentioned a whole bunch of the new products that we're rolling out, which we believe has an opportunity to continue to grow transaction revenue as well and offset declines that you see in industry environments. Alex Kramm : Okay. But on a historical basis, the revenue per mortgage going through your system should be up, right? I mean just thematically or not? So to come back to the question. Jeff Sprecher : Can you repeat the question? We didn't follow it. Alex Kramm : Sorry. But to come back to my original question, if I look at a historical basis, the revenue per mortgage growing the system should have gone up over the last year or so. I mean -- I assume, again, if you don't have any quantitative right, but like directionally, given that you're adding services should be up, correct? We're not looking at it like that. Jeff Sprecher : We don't necessarily look at it like that. But anecdotally, I'd say yes. Alex Kramm : Okay. All right. Thanks again. Operator : Thank you.  That was our final question. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over back to Jeff Sprecher for any closing remarks. Jeff Sprecher : Thank you, Danae. And thank you all for joining us this morning. We look forward to continuing to discuss our all-weather strategies with you as our world economy continues to evolve. And with that, I hope you have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Intercontinental Exchange Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mary Caroline O\u2019Neal, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Mary Caroline O\u2019Neal: Good morning. ICE\u2019s fourth quarter 2021 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived, and our call will be available for replay. Today\u2019s call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2021 Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You\u2019ll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP term in the earnings materials. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses, and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, references to revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain items. With us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chair and CEO; Warren Gardiner, Chief Financial Officer; Ben Jackson, President; and Lynn Martin, President of the NYSE and Chair of Fixed Income and Data Services. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Warren. Warren Gardiner : Thanks, MC. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I\u2019ll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our fourth quarter results. Adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.34, up 17% year-over-year, marking the best quarter in our company\u2019s history. Net revenues totaled a record $1.8 billion and increased 10% versus last year. Total transaction revenues grew 11%, while total recurring revenues, which account for nearly half of our business, increased by 10%. Fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $749 million, slightly higher than expected, driven by additional severance as well as higher performance-based compensation due to the strong results to finish the year. Adjusted operating income increased by 14%, totaling a record $1.1 billion. This strong operating performance contributed to a record full year free cash flow of over $2.8 billion, of which we returned $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, while also reducing our gross leverage to 3x EBITDA, nearly a full year ahead of schedule. Now let\u2019s move to Slide 5, where I\u2019ll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Fourth quarter net revenues totaled $1 billion, an increase of 17% year-over-year. This strong performance was driven by a 71% increase in our interest rate business and a 29% increase in our energy revenues, both driven in part by rising inflation expectations. Revenues within our global oil complex increased 29% year-over-year, while natural gas and environmental products, which represent approximately 40% of our energy revenues, increased by 36% in the quarter and were up 20% for the full year. Recurring revenues, which include our exchange data services and our NYSE listings business, increased by 8% year-over-year, including 10% growth in listings. Turning now to Slide 6. I\u2019ll discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services segment. Fourth quarter revenues totaled a record $480 million, a 7% increase versus a year ago. Recurring revenue growth, which accounted for nearly 90% of segment revenues, also grew 7% in the quarter. Within recurring revenues, our fixed income, data and analytics business increased by 6% year-over-year, including another quarter of double-digit growth in our index franchise, while other data and network services grew 7% driven by continued demand for our ICE Global Network and consolidated fees offering. For the full year, data services revenue increased by 6%. And importantly, annual subscription value, or ASV, enters the first quarter up 5.5%, setting us up for yet another strong year of compounding revenue growth. Let\u2019s go next to Slide 7, where I will discuss our Mortgage Technology segment. Fourth quarter Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $346 million. Recurring revenues, which accounted for over 40% of segment revenues, totaled $149 million and grew 26% year-over-year. While total Mortgage Technology revenues declined slightly, down 1% in the fourth quarter, we outperformed an industry that experienced a roughly 30% decline in origination volumes. For the full year, Mortgage Technology revenues grew 17% on a pro forma basis, reaching $1.4 billion well ahead of our initial expectations and on track to achieve our target of more than doubling revenues over a 10-year period. I\u2019ll conclude my remarks on Slide 8 with some additional guidance. We expect full year total recurring revenues to be between $3.68 billion and $3.75 billion. This includes approximately $30 million of headwinds related to FX, the planned phase-out of sterling LIBOR and Euronext post-Brexit decision to migrate certain connectivity services away from our UK data center and on to the continent. It is worth noting that the majority of Euronext connectivity revenues are expected to be offset by a related reduction in costs. Adjusting for these items, we expect core growth in our recurring revenues, which again account for half of our business, to be approximately 6% to 8% for the full year. This strong growth, which is on top of 10% growth last year, is expected to once again be led by our Mortgage Technology business, which we expect will grow in the low to mid-teens and importantly, is on top of an exceptional 30% growth in 2021. In addition, and supported by an ASV that exits the fourth quarter up 5.5%, we anticipate another year of 5% to 6% growth in our Fixed Income and Data Services recurring revenues. Moving to expenses. We expect 2022 adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $2.99 billion to $3.04 billion. Consistent with prior years, we will reward our employees for their contributions to our strong results and therefore, expect compensation expense, net of synergies and the resetting of 2021 performance awards, to increase by $25 million to $35 million. Expenses tied to revenues are also expected to increase by $25 million to $35 million driven by higher license fees as well as investments in business and product development across all three of our segments. In addition, we expect an incremental $40 million to $60 million in support of productivity and efficiency initiatives across our technology and operations groups, a portion of which we are electing to fund through the net operating savings we realized following the IPO of Bakkt. Lastly, and similar to last year, we expect roughly $30 million of incremental D&A expense related to purchase accounting and the rebuild of Ellie Mae CapEx. Please see Slide 12 in the appendix for a bridge reconciling our expense guidance to 2021. Moving next to capital allocation and consistent with our track record of growing our dividend as we grow, we plan to increase our quarterly dividend by 15% year-over-year from $0.33 per share to $0.38 per share. In addition, and now that we are within our targeted leverage range, we expect to deploy approximately $475 million towards share repurchases in the first quarter, representing a nearly 20% increase versus the second quarter of 2020, the last full quarter of buybacks prior to our acquisition of Ellie Mae. In summary, we delivered a record finish to another record year. We delivered double-digit growth in revenue, operating income and earnings per share. We also invested in an array of future growth initiatives, increased our dividend double digits and achieved our leverage target a year earlier than originally planned. As we kick off 2022, we\u2019re focused on, once again, delivering growth and creating shareholder value against what is an ever evolving macro backdrop. I\u2019ll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now, I\u2019ll hand it over to Ben. Ben Jackson : Thank you, Warren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 9. We are pleased to report another record year for ICE. Our strong financial results reflect the tremendous efforts of my colleagues across the organization, the trust and expanding relationship we have with our customers and the ability of our business model to drive growth across a variety of macroeconomic environments. I\u2019d like to focus on the secular trends that are driving growth across our mortgage and energy markets. And we\u2019ll turn it over to Lynn to discuss our position across fixed income, data and analytics and some highlights from our great year at the NYSE. Our data, technology and network expertise position us well to accelerate the analog-to-digital conversion happening across the mortgage industry. As mortgage origination costs continue to increase, electronification is a trend we believe will continue in a variety of interest rate environments and regardless of mortgage origination volumes. Our ability to capture this secular trend is evidenced by the strength and resiliency of our recurring revenues. Part of that growth is driven by our strategy to intentionally shift more business to recurring revenue. We also continue to see strong sales and new customers coming on to the platform. And with connectivity to nearly every participant in the mortgage industry, we have the opportunity to cross-sell new products like eClose and AIQ to a captive customer base seeking efficiencies. This flywheel effect and the secular trend of electronification give us confidence in our ability to grow this business and capture the $10 billion addressable market. Across our energy markets, we achieved record volumes in 2021, including in Brent, TTF and environmentals. The breadth and depth of our platform not only drove strong volumes and revenues, but more importantly, it positions us to capture secular tailwinds across our energy complex, including the globalization of natural gas in the clean energy transition. We have built a global natural gas business, including our European marker, TTF. The globalization of natural gas and the rise of LNG have driven TTF to emerge as the global gas benchmark. And in 2021, record volumes on our platform grew 45% and drove revenue growth of 36%. Our markets continue to be relied on by an increasing number of participants to manage risk and navigate volatile gas and power markets. We were also early to diversify into environmentals, acquiring the Climate Exchange in 2010 and building around those leading markets to develop a global environmental business. And in 2021, we reached record volumes across the complex, including in our EU, UK renewable greenhouse gas initiatives and California carbon allowances. These record volumes contributed to a 56% increase in environmental revenues versus the prior year. As customers navigate the uncertainty and volatility related to the clean energy transition, we are well positioned as the venue of choice to manage risk and provide price transparency across the energy spectrum. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn Martin : Thank you, Ben. With data and technology at our core, our goal is to provide solutions which add transparency to both commonly understood risks as well as emerging risks such as ESG. We continue to increase the breadth and coverage of our products and accelerate the delivery of our ESG reference data to the NYSE issuer community, providing non-opinion-based insights to market participants. And in the fourth quarter, we expanded our climate change and alternative data capabilities with the acquisition of risQ and Level 11 Analytics. Combining geospatial data technology with our financial data will bring greater transparency to ESG risks across the financial markets, including our existing muni bond and mortgage-backed security offering. Our data, technology and leading marketplaces position us well to benefit from the secular trend towards sustainability and net zero carbon commitments. Turning now to fixed income. Increased automation, flexibility of delivery and passive investing continue to drive demand for our proprietary data and rapidly growing index business. As a leading data provider to the fixed income market, we are uniquely positioned to drive automation. Leveraging our proprietary evaluated prices, analytics and our growing suite of reference data, we\u2019ve taken a business that historically served the back and middle office and created tools and analytics for the front office. These tools are critical to the pre-trade transparency needed in the opaque, less liquid fixed income markets as is evidenced by our front-office tools continuing to grow double-digits. The growth in passive investing continues to be a tailwind for our business. The flexibility of our tools, quality of our pricing data and flexibility of our offering directly contributed to the five asset managers with funds of over $66 billion of AUM that transitioned to ICE indices during 2021 and an additional group of funds with AUM of $6.7 billion have planned transitions during Q1 2022. This strength drove double-digit revenue growth in our index business for the fourth consecutive year and positions us well for continued growth. I\u2019ll close with some highlights from the NYSE. 2021 was a record year for NYSE listings. We help connect innovators and entrepreneurs to nearly $120 billion in capital through 297 IPOs, including three of the four largest IPOs and the three largest tech IPOs. And importantly, we continue to lead the market in ETF listings with more than 65% of new funds selecting us as their home. We also continue to prioritize our market-leading technology, which enables customers to better manage risk and provide our issuer community with significantly less volatility at the open and the close. The performance of our technology was proven as recently as last week when we processed nearly 0.5 trillion messages in a single day with median response times of less than 30 microseconds across our equities complex, further cementing our position as the leading equity exchange group. Our leading data and technology coupled with our investments in sustainable finance, the secular trends across fixed income markets and the competitive differentiators of the NYSE will continue to drive our growth well into the future. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Sprecher : Thank you, Lynn, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn now to Slide 10. 2021 marked our 16th consecutive year of record revenues and record adjusted earnings per share. This track record of growth reflects our strategy to diversify the business and position the company at the center of some of the largest markets undergoing an analog-to-digital conversion, a strategy that has made ICE an all-weather name, a business model that provides upside to volatility with less downside risk and importantly, a positioning that drives growth on top of growth. We have intentionally diversified across asset classes so that we are not tied to any one cyclical trend or one macroeconomic environment. For example, in 2021, we saw record volumes across our energy complex driven in part by inflationary concerns and market speculation of central bank activity. Our European and UK interest rate business also benefited from interest rate volatility, driving a 15% increase in revenues in 2021 and more recently, a 34% increase in our January revenues. Our CDS clearing business grew 14% in the fourth quarter as rate volatility increased, driving demand for risk management and credit protection. And even against this backdrop of rising interest rates, our Mortgage Technology business outperformed the broader market, including pro forma recurring revenue growth in 2021, up 31%, again, a reflection of the all-weather nature of our business model. As we begin 2022, we are better positioned than ever to capitalize on the secular and cyclical trends occurring across asset classes. And we remain focused on investing and executing on the many growth opportunities in front of us. Before we end our prepared remarks, I\u2019d like to thank our customers for their business and their trust in 2021, and I\u2019d like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their continued efforts. Your hard work contributed to the best quarter in our company\u2019s history combined with other excellent results, making it the best year in our company\u2019s history. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Andrew, our operator, to conduct the question-and-answer session until 9 :30 Eastern Time. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Rich Repetto : Yes. Good morning, guys. Good morning, Jeff. So my question is on the recurring revenue growth for mortgage. It was up 31%, and now you\u2019re guiding to, I think, low-double digits. Could you give us more color on that? Is that just the large numbers? Any progress on metrics to sort of \u2013 that we can monitor that recurring revenue in mortgage? And then lastly, Jeff, I know you talked about the offset, but how do you think about the offset going forward? Is it simply interest rate futures offsetting what looks like a slowdown in origination volumes going forward? Ben Jackson : Hi Rich, it\u2019s Ben. I\u2019ll start here. So the \u2013 you hit on it a bit in the way you answered the question. So you do have growth compounding on top of growth there in the subscription side of the business. But also, I mean, we are looking at macro headwinds. I mean, Warren brought up in his commentary that if you take a composite of where the industry analysts have volumes that you have volumes down 30%. And in that environment, we could see some macro headwinds such as are there going to be a bunch of brand-new originators coming on to the scene? Potentially not. Could you see some industry consolidation? Potentially, we\u2019ll see some of that. But despite those types of headwinds, we see an opportunity to grow this subscription business in the teens because we have great visibility to a phenomenal new business pipeline of new customers that we\u2019re looking at right now. We have the ability to cross-sell to that large stable of customers that we have solutions like our AIQ business, that will provide them more efficiency as well as our industry-leading point-of-sale solutions. And then the other dynamic that we have going on is that move towards subscription as customers renew. We had a pilot program last year where we have roughly 20% of our customers renew in a given year. With a small percentage of those that renewed last year, we looked at shifting them more towards subscription. We\u2019re successful doing that. And we\u2019ve codified a program of this year to hit a much larger percentage of the roughly 20% that are renewing this year. So all of those, we believe, are tailwinds to offset the macroeconomic environments there and will lead to a teens grower in subscription revenue, which we feel great about. Jeff Sprecher : And Rich, this is Jeff. Yes, we\u2019ve really thought hard over the last few years on how to position the company to be an all-weather name that will just grow on top of growth and in all macro environments and global geographies. And so our thinking is that inflationary pressures are what drive central banks to raise interest rates. And we have a lot of asset classes that we participate in and positioning of the company that will benefit from that volatility. And we tend to see commodity businesses like energy and agricultural commodities be very volatile in inflationary environments. And therefore, there\u2019s a lot of hedging, and we help people manage that risk. Similarly, obviously, in our interest rate businesses, which include interest rate futures and credit default swaps and fixed income data and services in a volatile interest rate environment, those businesses do well. And even in the mortgage space, as Ben has been talking about, home inflation tends to drive people to do cash-out refinancings, which for us, refinancing a house versus buying a new house is the same transaction to our mortgage platform. So we really feel like we\u2019ve positioned the company well in this environment. We also feel like we positioned the company well if there isn\u2019t inflation, if there isn\u2019t a lot of central bank activity. The low interest rate environment is where we always felt vulnerable, and we\u2019ve really done a number of things over the last few years that augment that base. So we hope you, in thinking about our company, will feel like you can safely purchase the stock for upside growth but limit your downside risk and that\u2019s really how as managers, we\u2019ve tried to position our company today. Rich Repetto : Thanks, Jeff. Very helpful. The colors helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. My question is on the environmentals complex. And wanted to think about the size of that market and maybe if you could address the customer base there, commercial versus financial kind of utilization and as we think about it versus some of your mature markets to kind of get a sense of where we are in the adoption phase of some of these products. Ben Jackson : Hi Dan, this is Ben. I\u2019ll take this one. We\u2019ve been spending a lot of time thinking about this in terms of the size of that marketplace. And when we look at any of our derivatives markets, we look at the underlying physical market as really a proxy for it. And the estimates out there that in any given year, you have around 50 billion tons of carbon that\u2019s emitted into the atmosphere around the world. And in the geographies where we\u2019re very strong and present right now, take North America, the EU and the UK, those geographies alone emit about 11 billion tons of carbon. And what we\u2019ve seen in terms of the derivatives markets as they mature is that it\u2019s common to see a derivatives market that would trade on top of the physical of around 10 times, if not more. So if you just use 10 times as that market matures as a proxy for how you define a TAM in the markets that we are today, that\u2019s around 110 billion tons equivalent of physical that can trade. And today, in the marketplaces that were strong, we traded 18 billion tons. So we\u2019ve hit about 16% of that TAM. And obviously, with that, there is a long runway to go in the geographies where we\u2019re strong today. And what will help feed that growth is more sectors of the economy coming in and trading these products as well as voluntarily more companies that are measuring their Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions coming in and also trading in those geographies. That adds more participants, adds more sectors of the economy and will lead to more transactions going on in the derivatives markets. The other obvious area of growth is just more geographies around the world and global programs, if they do come in place will increase the size of that physical market. But given that we represent around 95% of the world\u2019s trading that happen on our venues, we think we\u2019re very, very well-positioned to capture that growth opportunity and that TAM that I just outlined. Dan Fannon : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead. Alex Kramm : Yes. Hey, good morning, everyone. I want to ask about inflation broadly. It\u2019s been a big topic, obviously, this earnings season in the last few months for a lot of companies. Seems like on the cost side, you\u2019re managing that pretty well, but I\u2019m more interested on the revenue side. I mean, 50% of your business or so is subscription-based. So curious to what degree CPI is built into any of your subscriptions, to what degree that could help you or make pricing discussions easier? And then, of course, how much of that is baked into your recurring revenue forecast broadly? Thank you. Warren Gardiner : Hey Alex, it\u2019s Warren. So yes, there is an element of that to some extent, particularly on the CPI that is in terms of building some of the data contracts. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s necessarily a huge part of it. But again, that\u2019s going to be built into part of our guide there when we talk about 5% to 6% for the year. I think on the revenue side, really the more \u2013 it\u2019s what Jeff and Ben have been talking about in terms of our exposure, if you will, to inflation, and that\u2019s really going to come down to the commodities business; the interest rate business, which is off to a great start in January; the CDS business; the ags business within that commodities business. So I think that\u2019s really more in terms of our leverage to inflation expectations, if you will, on the revenue side. On the cost side, you\u2019re right. There certainly \u2013 we were seeing some pockets of it. It\u2019s third-party kind of services, as you would imagine, or pricing providers or things of that nature, things like utility costs, some technology costs like cloud providers and things like that, that are \u2013 that we\u2019re seeing some uptick on, but that again, that\u2019s all baked into our guidance that we provided you today. And then I think on the comp side, the way to be thinking about that is, look, we\u2019ve always been a pay-for-performance culture. We obviously had a really good year this year. We always want to monitor and retain kind of the best talent that\u2019s out there. But I think we do have \u2013 we have built up some goodwill, if you will, both with employees and potential employees from that perspective. So we\u2019re comfortable with that position on the comp side. And again, all of that\u2019s baked into our expense guidance for the year, as you saw. Alex Kramm : Fantastic. Thank you, guys. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning. Jeff, I wanted to pick your brain a little bit about crypto and blockchain, acknowledging that you and ICE were early and seeing the potential here with Bakkt and other investments. As we think about the mortgage process, is there a role you see for blockchain technology helping ICE digitize parts of the mortgage process or getting you closer to your vision in the mortgage area? And then it would seem like the information is indelible there to some of your comments at Alex\u2019s conference late last year. And then second, the crypto trading ecosystem is developing in a much more vertically integrated way. Do you see the crypto ecosystem moving more towards specialization over time like the cash equity world? Or is a chance that the cash equity ecosystem might evolve to look more like the crypto ecosystem? And does either of these have implications for the New York Stock Exchange? Jeff Sprecher : Those are two really thoughtful questions. Thank you for those, Ken. First of all, when we think about the blockchain, we think about its main value \u2013 well, it has two values in our mind. The main value is it creates an indelible record. And so to a certain extent, property rights are something that society views as an indelible record. And it\u2019s why we have title insurance, for example, in mortgages, so that we have an insurance wrapper around title to a property. And so you can imagine that an indelible record that\u2019s accessed by many, many people, that would ensure property rights for both mortgages or homes or any other asset is something that could grow. And it\u2019s an area that we definitely are focused on. The second attribute of blockchain and the broader cryptocurrency environment is that it has captured mind share and has really been used as a marketing tool to move people from more analog brokerage houses to more digital brokerage houses and give customers direct access. So those brokerages that didn\u2019t engage their customers digitally are seeing themselves somewhat being disintermediated by new brokers that are digital. The interesting thing about your question, the third part of your question, which is really what our regulators want to do about this? And largely speaking, our whole infrastructure for regulation in the Western world has been that there is a broker that has a customer relationship, and they have the KYC and AML responsibility for their customers. They have to know their customers, and they have to do anti-money laundering checks and balances. And once having done that, they can then access the broader market. And there\u2019s been a blurring in the crypto space between the obligations of a broker-dealer and the obligations of exchange and the obligations of clearinghouse. Generally speaking, in the organized clearing markets, there are intermediaries that are providing credit amelioration to the customer. And it is the collective balance sheet of all of those brokers and clearing firms that backstop the market. And in the case of some of the crypto companies, that is not the case. And so if those \u2013 if regulators decide to subject the straight-through processing companies to the same terms and conditions that they have subjected historical companies, those companies have some work to do around KYC, AML and credit amelioration and passing the IOSCO standards of a clearinghouse that has to be stress testing, which essentially is banking. If the regulators say, you know what, maybe those issues aren\u2019t as important as we had thought they were, and maybe having the consumer directly participate end-to-end is a better way, then you are going to see the legacy companies in our industry move more to opening up their clearinghouses to end users and opening up their platforms, matching engines and other platforms directly to end users and bypassing the brokerage community. I think it\u2019s too soon to predict what will happen there, but you can \u2013 to the extent that I\u2019ve helped your thinking at all, you\u2019ll see now as you read articles about what the various regulators are doing and saying that, that is the essential question that they\u2019re wrestling with. Do they bring the legacy business towards the crypto space? Or do they bring the crypto space into the legacy business? I\u2019d make one last comment, which is largely speaking in the United States, we\u2019re subject to the Securities Act of 1934. That act has withstood a lot of change in technology and in market structures and what have you. But based in the 1934 Act is the customer protection and fraud protection. And I suspect that notwithstanding there\u2019s a lot of people wanting the 1934 Act to be updated, there\u2019s a lot of tools in the 1934 Act for regulators to even deal with new technologies as they have done now over decades. But thank you for those questions. They\u2019re very thoughtful. Ken Worthington : Thank you, Jeff. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Michael Cyprys : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask about the cloud. I was hoping you might be able to remind us, which parts of your business today are on the cloud. And as you look forward, how do you think about the opportunity for migrating more of your business to the cloud? What benefits could you see, and which parts of the organization can make sense to do sooner versus which ones do you think would take a bit more time? Jeff Sprecher : It\u2019s a great question. We \u2013 first of all, we use the cloud and are active in the cloud in a lot of our businesses. And the main attribute that the cloud brings us is it\u2019s just another network where customers can get access to our products. We also run our own data centers, and we have our own network. And we\u2019re hooked to a lot of third-party networks. So our goal \u2013 and by the way, a lot of third-party screen providers and platform providers. So the cloud is important to us to the extent that we have clients that would prefer to receive services from us in the cloud. Where it is not as important to us is because of our scale and size, we are better able to control our costs when we\u2019re managing our own technology and network infrastructure. We have done a lot of analysis around this. And as, I think, Warren mentioned in his remarks to one of the inflationary questions, probably the highest inflation pressure that we\u2019re seeing right now is in the services that are in the cloud. We don\u2019t have good moats around our ability to control those costs notwithstanding. And so if clients, however, want to bear those costs, we\u2019re happy to provide them access through the cloud. But I think you\u2019ll see it as an important but augmented service that we have, not necessarily the key service. And last thing I would mention to you is I think we\u2019re different than some of our peers in that we have always felt that the way to control cost is to control our technology. It\u2019s not something that at its core that we license to others. It\u2019s not something at its core that we get from others, and it\u2019s not something at its core that we run in other people\u2019s infrastructures. Michael Cyprys : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Blostein : Hey, guys. It\u2019s Alex. So I wanted to go back to the mortgage question for a second. The \u2013 you gave some color about 2022 specifically. But clearly, it\u2019s a pretty meaningful slowdown in growth in recurring revenues into low to mid-teens from well north of 20% over the last 12 months. Do you think this is just a 2022 dynamic and the reasons you sort of described earlier just really kind of relate to the next 12 months? Or for a variety of reasons, this is more of a reasonable run rate we should expect over the medium term? Thanks. Ben Jackson : Alex, this is Ben. So when you look at that macro environment and again, Warren used that composite estimate of around \u2013 a backdrop of the business being down \u2013 or sorry, not the business, but the overall transaction volumes being down 30%. When I look at our strategy for this business in each of the segments that we have in this business, we are executing very, very well. And what\u2019s the evidence to that? Look at each of the segments underneath there. So despite that volume decline, our data and analytics business grew year-over-year. And we\u2019ve talked on a number of these calls on how we see that playing out over time, and that will continue to be a growth driver as more of our customers adopt automation. We also have our closing line item that\u2019s grown year-over-year as we\u2019ve invested a lot in \u2013 did a lot of brand-new innovations that the industry has not seen before over this past year. And as customers ramp on those, we\u2019re starting to see some substantial ramp-up on that, and that\u2019s leading to growth in that line item year-over-year. And on the origination line item, we way outperformed what industry transaction volumes were. And underneath the covers there, it\u2019s an explicit move towards more and more subscription. So we feel great about how the business is executing despite this near-term drop in volumes. It\u2019s hard to predict how long those \u2013 the drop in volumes will play out, but we feel good on our ability to grow this business and to outperform the industry backdrop based on our strategy in each one of those. And remember, on the \u2013 we just started that pilot program that was last year in terms of as every customer renews for a small percentage of them, we are shifting the revenue more and more towards subscription, and roughly 20% renew in a given year. And this year, we\u2019ve really codified a program to hit a much larger percentage. We have a long runway, I mean, doing the math. We have a long runway to execute that over many, many years that we believe we\u2019ll continue to lead to growth in that subscription line item. Alex Blostein : All right. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Maybe, Ben, if I could just come back to the environmental complex question and your answer to a prior question on that. Two-parter. First, on the 110 tons \u2013 110 billion tons of physical TAM that you mentioned, I just wanted to clarify if that is sort of a current TAM and then your expectations for that to grow over time as we move more into carbon transition. And then secondarily, it looks like the environmentals complex is now north of 10% of your energy revenue. Nat gas is also inching up as well, 25% or so. What is your view on nat gas as a transition energy and whether if we want to think about a long-term carbon transition, should we be thinking about that nat gas to grow as a portion of your total energy revenue, just like the environmental is growing? Ben Jackson : Yes. Okay. Thanks, Brian. So on that 110 billion tons of physical equivalent traded, yes. The estimate I used there, so that\u2019s again just based on the geographies where we are now. So that\u2019s North America, EU and UK and putting a 10x multiple on that. And as you picked up there and the way you asked the question, that\u2019s as markets are maturing, we see it can get to 10% but even order of magnitude more than that. If you take very well-established benchmarks, it can be 2, 3x that easily. So we see this as a market that as it matures can get bigger than that. So I see that as more of kind of a near to medium-term TAM that can be achieved in that environmental markets. But then also as more geographies get added around the world and as more of the overall $50 billion \u2013 sorry, 50 billion tons of carbon emissions that are happening around the world as more of that adds more programs, as more governments around the world add programs, we have an opportunity to go after that as well. So there\u2019s an acceleration that could happen on that over time. On the nat gas, you pointed out, environmental is at 10%, natural gas also continuing to grow. Our natural gas business is really the only global gas business around the world. Our TTF business continues to grow on top of growth. So you\u2019ve seen that continue to compound and customers coming to us around the world to manage their risk and using natural gas as the cleanest of the fossil fuels to help with this energy transition. And with the backdrop of industry estimates saying that energy demand is likely to double between now and 2050, we see that, that\u2019s going to be an important element in this transition towards a cleaner environment. And that this transition is going to be bumpy. And we\u2019re pleased to see that our customers are coming to as much \u2013 coming to us as much as ever to manage the risk in that environment. Brian Bedell : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Owen Lau : Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Could you please talk about your balance sheet investment? What\u2019s your plan to like maybe deconsolidate OCC and Bakkt? Or you will be more opportunistic to leverage your balance sheet to make additional investments? Thank you. Warren Gardiner : Hey, Owen, it\u2019s Warren. So with respect to Bakkt, as you probably recall, it was \u2013 we did deconsolidate that in the fourth quarter. It went public in October. So that is \u2013 certainly, we have a state that\u2019s on our balance sheet. That\u2019s an investment we\u2019ve been making over a number of years that we\u2019ve been very happy with and have a lot of confidence in the outlook for that business. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything to update there in terms of any kind of plans on that front. With respect to OCC, that is something that\u2019s on our balance sheet. We hit \u2013 I don\u2019t recall the exact mark of it, but it\u2019s a small investment that we have there. So we\u2019ll see if there\u2019s any opportunity there. But I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that, that\u2019s something we\u2019re thinking about at the moment. Certainly, it\u2019s part of what we do in the options and equity side to begin with. So I wouldn\u2019t be thinking about that. So we do, over time, as you know, with Euroclear and some of the other investments, we do look for opportunities that are within \u2013 that are sort of adjacent to what we do in our business. And so we will look for those opportunities and invest in those as we see it. So I think you could expect us to continue to do that when those opportunities arise. But those 10 \u2013 those will be sort of minority investment, small minority investors for the most part, as you\u2019ve seen with some of the ones we\u2019ve done in the past. Owen Lau : All right. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Please go ahead. Kyle Voigt : Hi, good morning. I just wanted to ask a question still on the energy topic, specifically on Brent and Brent open interest. We\u2019re seeing nice growth in the options OI in that complex, but Brent futures open interest specifically was down 17% year-on-year as of earlier this week. So I guess with the price volatility we\u2019ve seen the oil market over the past year, I just would have expected to see a bit stronger trends there. Just wondering if you could kind of opine on whether you think this is cyclical still related to kind of COVID normalization or whether there\u2019s something more secular going on there that\u2019s causing the decline would be helpful. Thank you. Ben Jackson : Thanks, Kyle. Yes. So we do see this as temporary. If you look at Brent overall, open interest today is about 5% over last year. You got to remember last year was also another very volatile year, where we saw tremendous growth in that business. So you are looking at a compare that\u2019s difficult. But on top of that, we\u2019re still growing that business and growing that business nicely. In addition, in oil overall, we have had a lot of success working with many of the physical industry participants in some brand-new innovations and ways for them to help manage their risk in the oil markets. The example would be ICE Futures Abu Dhabi that we launched last year to help people hedge and come up with a market price for hedging Murban crude oil that\u2019s going to Asia. And then just within two weeks ago, we launched our new HOU contract, which is Midland WTI American Gulf Coast contract, where we were selected by the industry to come up with a better way to price Midland TI as it gets to the Gulf and is going overseas. And both of those contracts have seen tremendous amount of pickup in physical market participants supporting it in early days, and we see those as highly complementary to the overall Brent complex. So it\u2019s an area we\u2019re going to continue to invest. We do see the COVID environment and jurisdictions and geographies opening and closing, opening and closing, unfortunately, does create some gyrations in here. But overall, we feel great about the oil complex. Kyle Voigt : Understood. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : This is Ely on for Craig. I had a question for you on December\u2019s leadership changes. Should we see those as a precursor to more meaningful strategy changes at NYSE? Or do you anticipate any changes will be more incremental? Specifically on listings, has the new team given any thought to lowering listing standards to help make the New York Stock Exchange a little more competitive in 2022 or maybe pivoting the brand to better appeal to all the new tech companies coming to public markets? Thanks. Jeff Sprecher : Sure. Good question. This is Jeff. I\u2019m surrounded by a generation that\u2019s younger than me, that\u2019s incredibly talented, that delivered the best year in our history. And those changes were an opportunity to start to put leaders in that generation. And because the company is so broad now and so geographically diverse, we\u2019re trying to give people in that leadership team opportunities to try their skills in different businesses and give them exposure to the markets. So I was thrilled to be able to ask Lynn Martin if she would lead the New York Stock Exchange. And I\u2019ll let her tell you what she\u2019s thinking. Lynn Martin : Yes. Thanks, Jeff, and thanks for the question. I mean, it\u2019s early days of me being in the seat at NYSE, but I continue to see a great opportunity to further cement NYSE as the home of global markets. We\u2019ve got \u2013 as I think about this year, we\u2019ve got a healthy pipeline of IPOs, although the timing of some of the companies coming to market is shifting a bit, given the macroeconomic environment. But importantly, we really see the environment changing. And the drivers of capital raising last year may have favored our competitors. So we see that shifting, given the strengths of our model. The issuers that I have been talking to more recently, CEOs that are looking to come to market, they\u2019re valuing different things. And they\u2019re valuing stability in trading, lower cost of capital and strong governance, and that really favors the NYSE market model. And our message around our market model, the differentiation and investment we\u2019ve made in technology and also the broader technology assets that we\u2019re bringing to bear through the various other ICE businesses are really resonating as differentiators for the New York Stock Exchange. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Simon Clinch with Atlantic Equities. Please go ahead. Simon Clinch : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to do a housekeeping really on the CapEx guidance. I was wondering if you could give us a bit more color as to how to think about CapEx going forward? And particularly, what\u2019s really driving that growth in \u2013 if you can tease out sort of the separate drivers for fiscal 2022? Warren Gardiner : Sure. Hey Simon, it\u2019s Warren. So right. So we were about $450 million, as you know, this year. That was kind of towards the high end of the range. Some of that is related to Bakkt. Of course, we had a full year of Ellie Mae. As you\u2019re looking at the guidance for next year, as you saw, it\u2019s about $520 million to $490 million. We are planning some data center migrations and some upgrades. That\u2019s adding about $80 million or so to that $590 million to \u2013 sorry, $520 million to $490 million. Those are going to result eventually in some cost savings. There\u2019s revenue-related expansion product \u2013 project within that. So all kind of good things on the back end of that investment. Within that guidance range of this year, probably around $100 million of Ellie Mae, too. So when you start to back \u2013 to peel off those pieces, well, you\u2019re back down to sort of the 300, 350 range, which is where we\u2019ll call it legacy ICE was and has been for a number of years prior to that acquisition and some of these productivity and efficiency investments that we\u2019re going to be making around some of the data center. Simon Clinch : Great. Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we have a follow-up from Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead. Alex Kramm : Yes. Hey, just a couple of quick follow-ups here. One on the mortgage side. Maybe I missed it, but can you give us an update in terms of where you stand with subscribers on eClose? And then also where we are in the subscription or subscription kind of like transition in terms of how many of your clients have now transitioned? I know it\u2019s about 20% a year, but just maybe an update there. And then also on the trading side, very quick. Obviously, with the contract transitions here in your IBOR, obviously, the rate book contract has been moving higher. We see that in your January number \u2013 numbers. I know it\u2019s a three-month lag number, and I can probably do the math, but just wondering what\u2019s a good RPC to use for the quarter or where we are running in January alone? Any color would be great. Thanks guys. Ben Jackson : Alex, I\u2019ll start on the mortgage side. I can give some color on the short-term interest rate transition as well. In terms of eClose, we\u2019re continuing to see that ramp. So we went to \u2013 we were at 76 customers last quarter and the last update here. We\u2019re now at 93. So we\u2019re continuing to see that pick up and ramp up. And we see as those customers ramp up, that\u2019s going to be yet another area that grows that closing line item on a year-over-year basis as that closing line item is going to be heavily transaction-oriented because a lot of the costs associated to closing fees actually go on to the end closing statement of the customer. So that is important to highlight that. And as we deliver more and more of these innovations and solutions, we are able to capture more revenue per loan, which is something that\u2019s important on that closing line item. On the subscription line item, so last year is when we started that pilot program, and we did a small percentage of what renewed. So if you take a ballpark of around 10% of the 20% that renewed, that\u2019s probably the right ZIP code of the number that we touched last year. And based on what we learned through that pilot program, we\u2019ve now codified a program that\u2019s going to hit a much larger percentage of the 20% that are going to renew this year. So that gets you into the ballpark of what we have accomplished being a very small percentage and that we do have a long runway of being able to do this over multiple years ahead of us. Just from the overall short-term interest rate transition and what we\u2019re seeing in that marketplace, that transition went seamless for us in terms of the short sterling to SONIA transition. We\u2019ve seen \u2013 we did have some trading volumes, some ARB trading volume that was trading short sterling versus SONIA. That obviously, when short sterling went away, came off. But when you look at the overall complex and this rising rate environment that we\u2019re in, in both the U.K. as well as the EU, the market overall is off to a great start in terms of both volumes as well as open interest. I\u2019ll hand it off to Warren to talk about RPC. Warren Gardiner : Yes, Alex, just quickly on the rates RPC. So yes, you\u2019re seeing a little bit of lift there. As we kind of transition into SONIA, as you know, that\u2019s a much bigger contract than what we had on the short sterling side. So there\u2019s a equivalent benefit, if you will, from the RPC to kind of account for that. So the revenue, if you were to look at it just on a revenue basis, that should be relatively neutral if you\u2019re thinking about it on a notional level. The other impacting factor there \u2013 and so I think at this current level, you\u2019re probably at a good place for that interest rate RPC moving forward. Obviously, the impact can be for mix, medium-term versus short-term rates of our rates overall. And then, of course, there\u2019s a component of FX that can flow through there as well. But again, all else equal, I think it\u2019s kind of a good \u2013 what we reported this month is a good run rate to be kind of thinking about for that component of our future business. Alex Kramm : Sounds good. I will follow up on that. Thanks. Operator : And I understand there\u2019s time for one more follow-up. That is from Kyle Voigt from KBW. Please go ahead. Kyle Voigt : Hey, thanks for squeezing my follow-up. So just on the expenses, the midpoint of the expense guidance, I think, is 5% year-on-year growth comparing to the adjusted OpEx, excluding Bakkt. Just wondering if you could talk about how committed you are to delivering operating leverage in 2022 specifically? Again, if we\u2019re looking at the business on an adjusted basis, excluding Bakkt. And then given the business mix change over the past five years or so, just wondering if you can update us on your view of long-term expense growth, what\u2019s the right expense growth rate long term for ICE? Thanks. Warren Gardiner : Sure. Sure. Thanks, Kyle. Good question. So you\u2019re right. At the midpoint, it\u2019s about 5% growth. Again, as I said in my remarks, there\u2019s a portion of that that we\u2019re electing to invest related to the IPO of Bakkt. So some of the operating savings that we had from Bakkt, it\u2019s about \u2013 if you include revenue, it\u2019s about $75 million of savings that we got from Bakkt. We\u2019re going to invest a portion of that this year in some of the tech and ops projects. So that\u2019s probably about a point of that, if you will, of that five at the midpoint that is coming from that. And those are things that certainly, we would have done, and we would do over time. But just given the opportunity we had with those savings, we chose to elect to do them now. And so look, ICE has always been conscious about cost controls and being good on expense controls and things of that nature. And so we did take that opportunity to do that in order to kind of save that later. But I think as you\u2019re thinking about it longer term, it\u2019s what it\u2019s been in the past. And then we\u2019ve talked about compensation expense being kind of lower single-digit growth in terms of merit annually. That\u2019s about half of our expense base. I think that when you think about noncomp expense, it\u2019s probably in a similar range. So I think a lower single-digit kind of expense growth range on an organic basis is a fair place to be. And again, that\u2019s against revenue. We don\u2019t give top line revenue growth overall for the business, but I think it\u2019s safe to assume that within the context of revenues growing faster than expenses. I think for instance, this year, we added $500 million of incremental revenue, which yielded $380 million or so of operating income. That\u2019s about a 75% incremental margin. So I think, yes, we\u2019re very much committed to that. Transaction business can certainly fluctuate here and there, but over the medium, long term, yes, we would certainly expect that operating leverage to flow through. Kyle Voigt : Great. Thanks, Warren. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Sprecher for any closing remarks. Jeff Sprecher : Well, thank you, Andrew, for running the call, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We look forward to soon updating you as we continue to innovate for our customers and give you the results of our all-weather business model as we continue to drive growth. And with that, I hope you have a great day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

With us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chair and CEO; Warren Gardiner, Chief Financial Officer; Ben Jackson, President; and Joe Tyrrell, President of ICE Mortgage Technology. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Warren. Warren Gardiner : Thanks MC. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on slide four of the earnings supplement with some quick highlights from our first quarter results and I'll turn it over to Jeff to discuss the exciting transaction we announced yesterday afternoon. First quarter adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.43, up 7% year-over-year, marking the best quarter in our company's history. Net revenues totaled a record $1.9 billion, an increase of 6% versus last year. Total transaction revenues grew 4%, while total recurring revenues which accounted for nearly half of our business increased by 9%. Importantly, this is on top of 10% growth in the first quarter of 2021. First quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $746 million in the middle of our guidance range. Had it not been for a few million dollars of severance, adjusted operating expenses would have been towards the lower end of the range. Looking to the second quarter, we expect adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $740 million to $750 million. First quarter adjusted operating income increased by 9% to a record $1.2 billion. While free cash flow totaled $660 million, which we largely deployed in the form of share repurchases of $475 million. Now let\u2019s move to slide five, where I\u2019ll provide a quick overview of the performance of each of our segments. First quarter exchange net revenues totaled $1.1 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year. This strong performance was driven by a 36% increase in our interest rate futures and a 16% increase in our energy revenues. Revenues within our global natural gas and environmental products which represent approximately 40% of energy revenues increased by 30% in the quarter. Recurring revenues which include our exchange data services and our NYSE listings business increased by 7% year-over-year, including 13% growth in listings. Turning now to slide six, in our fixed income and data services segment first quarter revenues totaled a record $509 million, a 9% increase versus a year ago. Transaction revenues increased by 28%, including 9% revenue growth in ICE bonds and 33% growth in our CDS business, driven by rising interest rates and macro-economic uncertainty. Recurring revenue growth which accounted for nearly 85% of segment revenues grew by 6% in the quarter, once again driven by double digit growth in our index and consolidated feeds businesses, and strong performance from our ICE Global Network and other data services businesses. And importantly, annual subscription value or ASV enters the second quarter up over 6% year-over-year. Shifting to Mortgage Technology on slide seven, first quarter revenues totaled $307 million, while total mortgage technology revenues declined year-over-year in the first quarter. We once again outperformed an industry that experienced a 40% decline in origination volumes, including an 80% decline in term refi volume. Recurring revenues which accounted for over half of segment revenues, totaled $156 million and grew 24% year-over-year. As the mortgage origination backdrop continues to normalize, customers are in search of both automation and greater efficiency, a trend that contribute to one of the strongest sales quarters for our data and analytics product suite, including the implementation of our analyzers by J.P. Morgan Chase. In addition, based on the strong performance through the first quarter of 2022 and the visibility we have into the current sales pipeline, we believe our current revenue growth in our mortgage business is trending towards the high end of our low to mid-teens guidance range. In summary, while a rapid rise in interest rates may have weighed on mortgage transaction volumes during the quarter, that same macroeconomic factor also provided a tailwind to our interest rate, commodity and fixed income businesses. And once again alongside strong growth across our recurring revenue base, helps us deliver another record quarter for revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share, a testament to the all-weather nature of our business model. With that, I'll hand it over to Jeff. Jeff Sprecher : Thank you, Warren. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Today we're here to discuss the financial results of the best quarter in ICE\u2019s history, along with our plan to continue our track record of growth with our agreement to acquire the public company Black Knight. Black Knight is an important piece of financial market infrastructure that we believe will allow us to continue to reduce the cost of home borrowing, when coupled to the other U.S. mortgage industry assets that we built and acquired. This proposed acquisition is another step in a journey that ICE has embarked on since its founding. As an early entrepreneur, I studied the exchange space and I discovered that the largest exchanges all had one asset class in common, interest rates. And what became abundantly clear during the financial crisis was that hedgers who thought they had affectively managed risk using legacy interest rate products were doing so very imperfectly. Couple that with the analog to digital conversion that's been happening to markets more broadly, and we saw a powerful opportunity to redefine our exchange business, and we've been diligently working on this thesis for more than 15 years. To compete with hedging products in the corporate borrowing area, we acquired Creditex in 2008, married it with a Board of Trade Clearing Corporation in 2009 and launched a clear credit default swap market that this quarter generated $72 million of revenue and grew 33% year-over-year. We acquired the Life Exchange in 2013 and revenue from its interest rate products grew 36% in the quarter. We acquired Interactive Data Corporation in 2015, and married it to the Bank of America/Merrill Lynch Credit and Bond Index business in 2017, to build tools and launch a powerful suite of corporate borrowing indices and reference data. We doubled the revenue growth in those businesses to an average annual rate of 6%. In the consumer lending area, because the largest amounts of consumer borrowing are tied to home mortgages, we pursued opportunities in the U.S. mortgage space, acquiring the Mortgage Electronic Registry Service in 2018, Simplifile in 2019 and Ellie Mae in 2020. When coupled together, these technologies can offer lenders the potential to shorten the time that it holds interest rate risk, market exposure, from the time of the consumer rate lock until the time of wholesale funding, fundamentally changing the risk profile for lenders. And by leveraging our data expertise across the company, we recently created the ICE Rate Lock Index and have announced that we're launching a Futures contract on it in the coming weeks, creating an even more precise interest rate risk management tool. Now, by adding Black Knight to our solutions set, we have the potential to further improve the capital market ecosystem that surrounds the funding of U.S. Home Mortgages. De-risking these markets for participants by shortening the duration when interest rate risks are held, making data more transparent to the risk holders and creating more efficient hedging markets for those involved should ultimately lower the cost for the entire market. There's no question that our thesis of producing better interest rate products and tools has been proven out, as we have transformed the way risk is managed in the markets we serve, and our thesis continues to compound on growth as we innovate new interest rate hedging tools. So let me now ask you to turn to slide six of the ICE and Black Knight transaction deck. Yesterday afternoon we announced that ICE has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Black Knight for $85 per share or a market value of $13 billion. Consideration is expected to be in the form of a mix of 80% cash and 20% stock and the transaction is expected to be accretive to adjusted earnings per share in the first full year following its completion. Warren will discuss the financials in more detail, but first I'll discuss the strategic rationale of this very exciting transaction. Black Knight is a premier provider of Integrated, Mission Critical, Software Solutions and Data and Analytics that serve the U.S. Mortgage and Real Estate Markets. Black Knight suite of solutions span across the mortgage work-flow and are highly complementary to ICE\u2019s existing businesses. By expanding our solution set beyond originations, we will be able to deliver a life of loan platform that reduces friction and drives transparency across the workflow. The integration of our solutions will strengthen the overall mortgage ecosystem, bringing more choice and delivering efficiencies for lenders, servicers, partners and ultimately the end consumer. This combination will also expand the addressable market in our mortgage business to $14 billion, and better positions us to penetrate our existing $10 billion TAM. Black Knight will complement our all-weather business model, with a high growth and highly recurring revenue base. And finally, we will leverage ICE\u2019s technology expertise to modernize Black Knight\u2019s technology stack, while tightly integrating our offerings to enable the many opportunities that are in front of us. Turning to slide seven. Much like the history and culture at ICE, Black Knight\u2019s mission focuses on customer service and product excellence. The expansive product suite and compelling value proposition Black Knight brings to its customer base has enabled consistent revenue and EBITDA growth, a trend that we believe will only continue as a part of ICE. Moving now to slide eight, you'll find a summary overview of our strategic rationale, which I'll discuss in more detail with the subsequent slides, beginning now on slide nine. The opportunity we see in the mortgage space is much like the opportunities that we're executing against other interest rate markets and asset classes, by integrating data and technology across the entire work flow, to bring greater transparency and efficiencies to the broader ecosystem. The very manual loan origination process and its extensive regulatory oversight has driven the cost to originate a U.S. home mortgage in nearly $9,000, with approximately one quarter of that amount being related to customer acquisition costs. As a result, more lenders are beginning to retain the servicing rights of the mortgages that they originate to recapture previous customers and reduce their acquisition costs. By connecting Black Knight servicing system to the underwriting automation and consumer engagement solutions at ICE, we have an opportunity to create a life of loan platform that will enable lenders to realize a customer for life. This connection will lower the acquisition costs for lenders, enabling those savings to be passed on to the consumer. Turning now to slide 10. Data is a core competency at ICE, from our earliest days we recognize the value of leveraging data to drive transparency, and we continue to build on that expertise by broadening our datasets, connecting data across asset classes and innovating for our customers. The data sets that exists across the complementary businesses of ICE and Black Knight present an untapped opportunity to apply that same playbook within home mortgage. With access to solutions such as Black Knight\u2019s MLS listing services and real-estate data, we\u2019ll have a presence in the home search process. In addition, there's an opportunity to leverage Black Knight\u2019s tax data and property valuation analytics to further enhance the underwriting process and provide our customers additional insights into rapidly changing market dynamics. We\u2019ll also have the opportunity to expand our existing ICE Mortgage Technology Solutions set into secondary markets, increasing the transparency for servicers and investors, by enabling them to better understand their portfolio valuations, performance and risk. And by combining this rich data with ICE\u2019s expertise in fixed income and capital markets, we\u2019ll be able to provide even greater transparency to the fixed income markets through transaction based data for more accurate pricing and prepayment modeling. Turning now to slide 11. As we've demonstrated in our other asset classes, the integration of data and technology across the mortgage workflow should enable greater automation and in turn reduce friction to help lower the cost to originate our home mortgage for all parties, ultimately making our loan more affordable and accessible for the American home buyer. By adding content to our Consumer Engagement Solutions, we plan to provide consumers and investor\u2019s greater clarity and insight into unique loan products, and the key metrics that impact homeownership such as interest rate levels in lending policies, ultimately improving the overall home buying experience for the consumer. Lenders will also be able to proactively underwrite current customers for future home lending opportunities, by helping consumers lower their housing payments by refinancing out of additional interest rate overlays or reducing their risk adjustments to the original mortgage. And leveraging common datasets across the entire mortgage cycle could reduce data entry errors and erroneous fees that today impact consumers directly. We also see an opportunity to develop innovative analytics, helping lenders connect with potential buyers in historically underserved markets, and identify minority bias in the home valuation process. These are just a few of the many examples, of the many opportunities that we see to leverage our data and technology to support potential homeowners, and make the dream of home ownership a reality. Moving to slide 12, the work flow efficiencies, this combination will deliver underpin and expanded addressable market of $14 billion, including $2 billion from servicing solutions and an additional $2 billion within data and analytics. Our combined businesses will bolster our point of sale and Consumer Engagement Solutions, enabling us to better serve that portion of our existing TAM. In order to provide you with additional transparency into this opportunity, we've separated this $2 billion addressable market from the application processing and underwriting segment, which here is largely made up of our Loan Origination Technology. Black Knight also brings capabilities that will allow us to access part of our existing TAM that we don't have a solution for today such as their hedging and trading platform. These capabilities combined with our deep expertise in trading and clearing unlock our longer term opportunity to improve transparency for the secondary market participants in the form of a loan exchange. And finally, we\u2019ll be better positioned to monetize our current $10 billion TAM to opportunities to promote existing products across an expanded customer base. Moving to Slide 13. Black Knight\u2019s highly recurring, more predictable revenues will complement ICE's existing revenue streams and increase our mix of high growth recurring revenues. Within ICE Mortgage Technology, our mix of recurring revenues will increase from roughly 50% to approximately 70% and total ICE revenues will now be over 50% recurring on a pro forma basis. Importantly, these high growth recurring revenues are underpinned by mission critical data, and technology that's embedded in our customers workflows, and by adding more stable revenue streams to our current mortgage technology revenues, we will improve the visibility and durability of our earnings and cash flow, further complementaring our all-weather business model. Let me now turn the call back over to Warren, and he'll discuss the financial details of today's transaction. Warren Gardiner : Thanks Jeff. Please turn to slide 14. As Jeff noted, yesterday we announced we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Black Knight for $85 per share or market value of $13 billion. The share prices in line with Black Knight\u2019s 52 week high just achieved on December 30, 2021 represents a fully synergized EV to EBITDA multiple of approximately 15x forward. We anticipate the transaction will be accretive to ICE\u2019s adjusted earnings per share in the first year post close, with adjusted earnings accretion accelerating thereafter. Embedded within our purchase value are cost synergies of approximately $200 million, with one-third realized in year one, two-thirds by year three and 100% by year five. These cost synergies are expected to be driven by the integration of corporate functions, real-estate optimization and a more efficient use of shared services across the combined platform. When combined with the remaining Ellie Mae synergies, total expected cost synergies represent approximately 15% of the pro forma IMT Black Knight expense base. Shifting to revenues, we've underwritten approximately $125 million of net revenue synergies by year five, representing roughly 1% of our expanded $14 billion addressable market. These synergies will largely be driven by cross sell of existing products across our expanded customer base. Transaction consideration will come in the form of 80% cash and 20% stock. The plan to finance the cash component through a combination of commercial paper, newly issued debt and cash on hand at the time of close, which we currently anticipate will be in the first half of 2023. Gross leverage at close is expected to temporarily peak at approximately 4.1x pro forma EBITDA, which is below the 4.25 peak leverage we reached with Ellie Mae. We believe this financing structure demonstrates our commitment to maintaining a solid investment grade rating, and as of this week we've elected to spend share purchases until our leverage falls below 3.25x, which we anticipate will be towards the end of 2024. You will note on appendix slide 24, our strong track record of deleveraging post acquisition. As with Ellie Mae, we are targeting normalized leverage levels in the 2.75 to 3 range. We believe our enhanced cash flow generation will allow us to achieve this deleveraging path, even as we continue to invest in our business and our people, while also continuing to grow our dividend. Moving to slide 15. Based on first quarter results and pro forma for Black Knight, we expect that our mortgage segment will represent approximately 30% of total Ice revenues compared to 16% previously. Recurring revenues within our mortgage segment are expected to account for nearly 40% of total ICE recurring revenues, where our mortgage transaction revenues will represent only 10% of total ICE revenues. In addition, on close we anticipate providing additional metrics to help investors better understand the progress we are making as a combined platform, and the secular growth opportunities that underpin the analog to digital conversion occurring within the mortgage space. With that, I'm happy to take your questions in Q&A. But I\u2019ll first turn the call back over to Jeff for some closing comments. Jeff Sprecher : Thank you, Warren. I'll conclude my remarks on slide 16. Since our founding, ICE has operated with a strategy to build tools and markets for institutions and consumers, which operate in the white space of the inefficiencies of legacy markets, and we seek to do this smartly, in a manner that enables us to grow our earnings in all economic and interest rate conditions, so that ICE is truly an all-weather growth story, something that does not exist in a single market or asset class alone. This vision is one that we continue to organically build out ourselves, but one only has to look at our acquisition history, including my original acquisition of the founding company to ICE, to see that its valuable assets become available to us at prices that meet our disciplined M&A criteria, than will accelerate our build out plans by our acquisition. And through thoughtful integration, leveraging the infrastructure and expertise of the acquired company, we advance our vision and accelerate our goals to fundamentally transform the markets in which we operate. Our proposed acquisition of Black Knight is another important piece of this vision. I'll now turn the call back to our moderator Betsy, and we\u2019ll conduct the question-and-answer session. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Rich Repetto : Yeah, good morning Jeff, and good morning Warren, and congrats on the announcement of the acquisition. So I guess probably the first reaction we get from investors in this space you know was on the regulatory risks and the anti-trust potential issues. So I guess Jeff the question is, you know how comfortable are you with this anti-trust risk? Do you think the front end, the LOS systems, do you think you'll have to divest of anything to get this deal through and what kind of impact would you expect if you do? A - Jeff Sprecher : Sure. Rich, I\u2019m joined here by Ben Jackson and Joe Tyrrell who are going to run these businesses for us, so let me turn it over to Ben. Ben Jackson : Hey Rich! Good question and you know obviously it's a large deal, so we expect it to take time for regulators to understand the complementary nature of our two businesses. But at the end of the day we're confident that they'll come into the same conclusion that we did, and also we had and as well as Black Knight had legal counsel look at this in detail, and came to the conclusion that these are 100% complementary businesses that service different parts of the mortgage ecosystem. And at the end of the day, and you heard it through the prepared comments through Jeff's comments today, that bringing these businesses together is the best way to further advance innovation in the mortgage industry and bring efficiencies that are desperately needed to the servicers, to originators and then through to the end customer. And when I say that the businesses are complementary and Jeff referred to slide nine in the deck when he was going through it, which I think is a great picture of it. You can see that with Black Knight\u2019s businesses, they start really in the front end on the real estate side where we do not have assets, and then they pick up again post the closing process where they have services and software that they provide that helps us on the servicing side of the business, to manage the relationship between the customer and the servicer through the life of the loan. Those are all services that we do not have today. Black Knight\u2019s other core business is data assets. So they have proprietary data assets and very unique capabilities there that we do not have, that we believe are going to be very beneficial to our clients. Third, they have a complimentary loan origination system, which is one of the things that you just highlighted. But it\u2019s important to point out that the customers that they cater to are fundamentally very different, have a completely different mindset to the customers that we service today at ICE Mortgage Technology. They provide a service that\u2019s an installed service. It's a single instance for a single client, it's very highly customized based on the experience that that lender may want to provide for their clients. Whereas at ICE, ours is a very standardized solution and all you can do is do some basic configuration around the perimeter of it. Our plan is to support and invest in both, to really help drive the efficiencies through the industry by providing that complete front to back service. And the last thing I\u2019d point out is you'll see in the expense synergy numbers that Warren went through. By historical standards for us they are very low, and as Warren pointed out, most of these synergies are in the areas of corporate, real estate, our location strategy as we found, Jacksonville is a low cost place in the U.S. to do business and has a great resource pool. So those are the key areas that you're going to see synergies coming out of the deal and again, a 15% of the combined expense base that\u2019s very low. Rich Repetto : Great! Thanks for the response Ben and congrats Jeff that you tried to influence another asset class. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead. Alex Kramm : Hey, good morning, everyone. I'm just going to ask a bunch of boring financial questions on the deal. One, with interest rates obviously heading higher, would be curious what the interest rate is Warren that you\u2019re assuming in the deal [mass] (ph). Speaking of deal [mass] (ph), curious when you talk about accretion in year one, is that against an earnings expectations that includes buybacks or not. And then lastly you know what's the expected growth rate down the line for the business. When you did the Ellie Mae deal you said the mortgage business for you should be growing in 8 to 10 range. I think Black Knight has grown 8% historically, I think that's in your presentation. So you\u2019re still comfortable that the mortgage segment for you is this 8 to 10 kind of long term grower or should we be thinking about that business differently in the future? Thanks. Warren Gardiner : Yeah, thanks Alex. So I'll start with that last question first. So yeah, the short answer is yes. So I think if you think about what Black Knights outlined and this is revealed in \u2013 you know through our due diligence we revealed the same thing. They pointed to a guidance range around 7% to 9% over the long term. Largely recurring revenues too as you\u2019ve heard us note a couple of times already in the prepared remarks. I think the first quarter too by the way is a great example of that, where I noted in my prepared remarks that mortgage volumes were down significantly, including term refi volumes down, which are very sensitive, down about 80%. In that environment they grew their revenues on an organic basis, about 9%. They released their earnings this morning if you want to go check that out. So I think it's a great example of the resilience of that revenue stream against what was a pretty challenging macroeconomic backdrop, so yes. So when you couple that with our 8% to 10% percent as you noted, so that's what we talked about over a longer period of time on average and throw in the revenue synergies that we've outlined, yeah your very much solidly in that high single digit, you know 8% to 10% call it range for the combined business. And so yeah, you've got a very high single digit grower. It's still got a lot of recurring revenue and again, we\u2019re collectively positioned to operate with an expanded addressable market like we \u2013 unlike we are today. So I think very well positioned kind of moving forward you know for that business with a more resilient revenue stream as well, if you will. In terms of your first question, so I\u2019ll hit these ones, these are kind of quick ones. The rates we\u2019re assuming there, so it's a mix of commercial paper and debt. You can think about it on a blended basis kind of being in the 4%, 4.5% kind of percent range in terms of what we assumed for financing, and then on accretion year one, I think you asked if buy backs were included in the base, and so yes, we did include those as part of the base in terms of you know how consensus would be looking at that. Hopefully that helped in answering those questions. Alex Kramm : Thank you very much, very helpful. Operator : The next question comes from Gautam Sawant from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Gautam Sawant : Good morning! And thank you for taking my question. Can you tell us how both companies are positioned against the rising mortgage rate and higher home price backdrop? I understand that Black Knight has a higher mix of recurring revenues, but can you help us understand how you foresee the backdrop impacting revenues? A - Ben Jackson : Yes, thanks for the question. This is Ben. When we think about the deal and we thought about why we should do this deal, you know we had conviction on it, because as I mentioned before, at the end of the day the combination of these two businesses provides an opportunity to create a lot of efficiencies in a market that's very inefficient. One of the marketplaces in the industry that\u2019s the most inefficient, that's the most analog is the mortgage space and we think that this is an opportunity to take two rare sets of assets that are 100% complementary and bring them together. And you know when we see the revenue opportunities here with the business is that again, the businesses are 100% complementary to one another, where we end on the origination side into the electronic closing side. They pick up with a great servicing business. Black Knight has a tremendous set of data and proprietary data assets that we believe we\u2019ll be able to cross sell to our clients and are going to be in high demand with our clients, even in this rising rate environment, and they have that complementary loan origination system that we fully plan to support. The other side of it is that they have a \u2013 they are going to help continue the journey we've been on since we did the deal with ICE Mortgage Technology to move more and more of the revenue towards recurring, and you saw that in our results in the first quarter, where recurring revenue grew 24%, again against that backdrop of a rising rate environment. The mix as Jeff mentioned in his prepared remarks of recurring revenue that's counter cyclical in Black Knight is substantially higher than ours, and will move our mortgage business to 70% recurring. In addition, in this rising rate environment we're going to be able to go after the expanded TAM of $10 billion going to $14 billion, and the components of that are adding a servicing TAM of $2 billion and adding an additional $2 billion towards data and analytics, and give us the ability to accelerate going after the existing TAMs that we see. So given the resiliency of that business model that Black Knight has, continuing to shift more of the business towards recurring, you have a millennial generation that's just now coming into their home ownership years, that is a very substantial population in the U.S. that's going to be entering the mortgage buying market and we see all of those as trends that will help support you know the long term goal of 8% to 10% growth for the business. A - Jeff Sprecher : There's an incredible demand for homeownership coming from that group that will be unabated and similarly the slide before that, 29, you look at the total U.S. housing stock and you could see the long term trend of continued growth in home ownership, and those massive demographic trends are what give us confidence on moving our business to a more subscription based business that will essentially be attractive to lenders who are trying to play against that trend. Gautam Sawant : Got it. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning! I wanted to follow-up on the revenue mix of Black Knight and thinking about the servicing component, you know what is the growth algorithm of that business? Is it you know kind of just loans outstanding? I understand it\u2019s quite recurring, but curious about pricing power in this business? And then also, when you talked about revenue synergies in the opportunity, I guess give us a \u2013 what do you think are the most logical or easiest kind of points or cross sell opportunities within the two product sets as you combine them? Warren Gardiner : Hey Dan! It\u2019s Warren. So I\u2019ll hit you're servicing growth algorithm question first, and then I\u2019m going to hand it over to Joe to talk about some of the revenue synergies. So thinking about the servicing business, yeah it's kind of been a mid-single digit grower. I mean it\u2019s been fluctuating a little bit here and there, it depends, but largely recurring revenue in nature, it\u2019s not entirely recurring revenue nature and based on subscription revenues, but also loans outstanding too as well, which as you see there's a slide in our deck around home stock and then mortgages outstanding. You see there\u2019s pretty consistent growth over the last few years and over the last number of years, you can you can pick your time very frankly, and it consistently grows. And so that's a \u2013 that in addition to the introduction of new products and things of that nature, sort of adding revenue per loan is how you get to a growth algorithm around that range for that business. Joe Tyrrell : And this is Joe Tyrrell. I\u2019ll talk a little bit about the revenue synergies and the opportunities that this combination provides to us. So Warren talked about the opportunity to \u2013 through these combined entities to accelerate our penetration of the original $10 billion TAM. That comes to us because of the highly complementary products sets we have available, and actually the opportunity to cross sell products into both bases. So for example, we're able to take ICE Products Solutions, like our consumer engagement suite that has lead management and lead distribution capabilities, as well as our point of sale system. Also our underwriting automation tools that are getting a lot of adoption as Warren mentioned earlier. Even Chase is now deploying our analyzer solutions, I mean to their system, as well as our market leading eRecording capability. So those are all opportunities that we can sell existing ICE Solutions into the Black Knight base. We can also take Black Knight products and sell them into the ICE space. So obviously servicing and I'll talk about the trend that we're seeing with lenders starting to retain more servicing in just a moment, but also the secondary marketing technology, things like hedging and loan trading platform that they provide. We also now will have the opportunity to recognize. I think of this as more of an MSRP versus some of the transactional fees that we've been able to generate on our network. Black Knight products are actually available today on our network. One of the things that our network does at ICE is it really enabled access to choice for lenders, and so we've had a long standing relationship with many Black Knight Solutions being available. We\u2019ll now have the opportunity to realize kind of the list price for those fees instead of just the transactional components that we've had. And then \u2013 so that\u2019s true for things like tax service, property valuations and obviously Optimal Blue's been on platform for many, many years. We also now have the opportunity to really expand how we've been thinking about data. Historically our data TAM has really been focused on selling data within the mortgage industry. Now as we look at these highly complementary datasets, it gives us the opportunity to think about licensing this data. So we just recently released our first kind of true data product using the mortgage data that had come from Ellie Mae through our Rate Lock Indices and we've announced that we intend to put a Futures contract against that. As we're able to compliment all of that origination data, with the secondary marketing data that we get from Black Knight, coupled with the servicing and loan performance data, we now have a really unique data set that as Jeff mentioned is going to provide a completely different level of transparency and visibility into how the secondary market thinks about pricing our mortgage backed securities and certainly modeling out prepayment. This also provides us the opportunity to enter new TAMs. So obviously servicing as Ben talked about is a $2 billion TAM that we now have access to, that previously we\u2019ve had no offerings and didn't include in our current TAM. What we're seeing there in the servicing side is more lenders as Jeff mentioned are retaining the servicing rights. But what they've really lacked is the ability to connect everything from the point of thought of engaging a consumer, through the loan manufacturing process, into servicing and keeping that as almost a closed loop ecosystem where they are constantly monitoring loans to identify opportunities to help consumers improve cash flow, by getting out of some of those risk adjustment that were put in place at the time of origination by monitoring things like home value appreciation or changes in the economic situation of those consumers, where now those lenders can proactively go out and help them improve their cash flow which ultimately lowers default rates for consumers, but enables those lenders to recapture that, that consumer without incurring that acquisition cost. Also, it gives us the opportunity to enter into a realtor TAM and that data is really interesting too us, especially on the multiple listing service side. And so think about the opportunities of now combining data from consumer behavior to home listings, all the way through the loan performance. In the data TAM we see that as that unique opportunity from a licensing perspective, which we believe increases our previous data TAM by another $2 billion. And then lastly, I would just say that this really helps us to accelerate our shift that we've already been engaging on, to more of a recurring revenue, a focus versus the transactional. As interest rates rise, what happens in the servicing business is those loans stick in the servicing longer. So you have a more consistent recurring revenue base in servicing whenever interest rates increase. Now as interest rates decrease, we\u2019ll be able to capitalize on the monetization opportunities in the origination side. So it really gives us now this end-to-end, somewhat counter cyclical recurring revenue stream. Dan Fannon : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Ken Worthington : Hey! Good morning! And thanks for taking the question, and we're restricted on the deal, so I\u2019ll pivot to maybe European energy. So I want to hear your thoughts about the impact that the Ukraine crisis could have on your energy business in Europe, and maybe the ICE Exchange business more broadly. Really trying to focus on the longer term since the sourcing of European gas and oil maybe changing meaningfully for the longer term. So if you could start out, maybe what do the changes in the sourcing of European oil mean for Brent? Is that largely a zero-sum game or is it as positive as Europe moves off Russian oil. Two, same question on European gas. As we see more North African gas and maybe LNG from the U.S. and Qatar, again a zero-sum game or more positive? And then lastly, the ancillary impacts on the non-European energy businesses. It seems like there could be a positive impact here on carbon freight Sonya Houston, U.S. Gas. So any thoughts on you know collectively the non-European energy impact as well. Jeff Sprecher : Yeah, those are a good set of questions. So well let me, you know we had a great quarter amongst all that uncertainty that existed in the energy markets and if you peel back what happened in the quarter, it actually answers a number of the questions that you postulated. First of all, we see record open interest in our energy space. So there's more engagement if you will, of managing risk in the energy space. But when you peel back, well where did that open interest come from, there's definitely some trends that are engaging on where your question is heading. First of all, we saw that a lot of price volatility obviously in Europe, that happened quickly due to war, and whenever there's high price volatility, that is an input into the margin model, since your essentially marketing for the largest one day price movement. And so margin rates go up. And so what we saw was a movement towards the use of options, away from the underlying towards the option against the underlying. Why does that happen? Well it's a little less expensive to control the risk in an option. It's also much less precise; you're hedging a range of outcomes instead of a specific outcome. So people have moved and it's probably somewhat temporary, because high prices themselves don't cause high margins, it's the price movements and the market is increasingly as you're alluding to, trying to figure out the long term ecosystem for energy in Europe and as they do that, the prices will stabilize, albeit at most likely at higher rates. Another thing that has happened is that in a number of our products, particularly in Europe, but even Brent Oil globally, people can deliver Russian energy into those indices or into those products that are physically delivered, and while many of those Russian products are not subject to sanctions, and in fact certain countries in Europe are even advocating the use of those products, the market itself due to moral and ethical issues, many companies have decided not to participate in those. So we are launching a whole new suite of products that are Ex-Russia Energy and there's been a lot of demand for those products and we've got regulatory approval and you're going to be seeing those rolling out. We have very high expectations for those products given the chat that's going on and the way we\u2019ve worked with the industry to develop those Ex-Russia Energy projects. Then, the last thing that you polluted to is that you're seeing an increase volume in the trading up U.S. Natural Gas. Again, we see Europeans who are sensitive to hedging using European Natural Gas, because it may have Russian molecules in it, hedging their exposure somewhat in the United States. Obviously there's liquefied natural gas exports out of the U.S., those are relatively limited, but where there is capability, people are leaning into those capabilities and you've seen this increase in U.S. Natural Gas trading. So all of that amalgamation somewhat bodes well for our business and that we\u2019ve you know, in a world where markets are in contango, high open interest foreshadows future volume and revenue growth for us in trading and we've got this new suite of products that the market is anxious to adopt, and it\u2019s going to give us even more diversity and basis trading against our historical business. So we feel very good about the direction that the company is heading in, even though we're helping people to manage risk in a very unfortunate situation. Ken Worthington : Okay, great. Thank you so much for that. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Allen with Compass Point. Please go ahead. Chris Allen : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on some prior questions, and maybe some different angles. Just from a customer based perspective, what is \u2013 does BK, does Black Knight add any \u2013 present new opportunities to penetrate different customer bases? I believe they've had some recent success penetrating some of the non-bank originators who used homegrown solutions. And also when you put the whole franchise together, who is going to be the main competition from a longer term perspective? Joe Tyrrell : Chris, so this is Joe. I'll give you the answers there. When we think about the customer bases, again if you go back to Ben\u2019s comment regarding explaining the differences between Encompass and Empower, these two solutions really now give us the opportunity to address any technology philosophy that a lender might have. So if someone wants really a single tenancy highly customized solution, we will have an offering there. If they want a more kind of commercial, highly configurable, but multi-tenant solution, we\u2019ll have an offering there. So because these products are so complementary, we believe it gives us an opportunity to really accelerate that penetration of the current TAM. There obviously are some customers that we have in common, because within ICE there is so many different products that we offer, but what we really see is the cross sell opportunity into these two bases. So even where we might have a similar customer, perhaps it's a customer that\u2019s using Encompass and also sing MSP, the servicing platform, there is still so many other solutions we now have available jointly that we can cross sell to that individual lender. If you go back and look at slide nine, this is a high level view of kind of solution sets, but within these sets there's multiple products, and so there's so many different ways to monetize a single loan that goes through this entire work-flow, and we're really excited about the opportunities we have of looking at our combined solution sets, and being able to now make sure that we can provide efficiency that literally every step of this manufacturing and servicing workflow. And then you know lastly the data is a huge opportunity for us. Very complementary datasets between what we have on the front end and what Black Knight offers on the backend, and for us we think it's really just kind of tip of the spear when we think about how we can monetize that data. Chris Allen : Thanks. Any color on the competition? Joe Tyrrell : Yeah, on the competition, it really has not changed. This transaction doesn't change that. Our competition continues to be proprietary systems, legacy technologies that many lenders have had for a number of years. I think we\u2019ve \u2013 Ben's probably mention on previous calls that we\u2019ve really started to see that get unblocked. That is a lot of those lenders are realizing. As you go back to what Jeff pointed out on slide 34, whether a lender does one loan or a thousand loans, they have to navigate all of this highly regulatory compliance requirements. And so these lenders have realize that they've spent a significant amount of development dollars just maintaining legacy systems to remain compliant, instead of really focusing on innovation. So we're engaged in a lot of great conversations with many of those lenders who've been using proprietary technology. This combination and these two offerings that we now have, give us the opportunity to really be able to offer a solution for whatever technology philosophy those lenders have, coming off of the proprietary technology. So that continues to be the area where we\u2019ll be chopping wood. Chris Allen : Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Please go ahead. Kyle Voigt : Hi! Good morning! I just want to follow-up on the potential combination of Encompass and Empower. From your prior comments, it didn't sound like you expect those two businesses to really be fully integrated, and expect to continue to invest in those separately. So just to clarify, are any of the total synergies you outlined on the revenue or the cost side attributable to the combination of those two LOS platforms? And I understand a lot of strategic rationale for the deal is really about pairing the origination servicing businesses, as well as expanding that data TAM. Is it fair to say that this deal is very strategically attractive to ICE, even without considering a combination of those LOS platforms? Ben Jackson : Hi Kyle! It\u2019s Ben. So we 100% see those platforms as complementary and they service a completely different client with a completely different type of mindset, and there is no part of our synergy case that assumes that both platforms would be combined, one would get sunsets. In fact it's the opposite. We have put into our model significant investment into, that we know is going to be needed to help modernize certain parts of the technology, both on MSP as well as in Empower, and we know that clients that have made decisions to go on to Empower you know for very specific reasons, for their strategy have decided to have a single instance on-prem, highly customized version of the application. So that, there's again 0% of \u2013 zero part of our business case here is around sun setting one of the technologies or about investment in the two. And as Joe articulated, it's about cross selling all of the other suites of services that we have, whether you've chosen Empower or Encompass, cross selling all those other services to be able to create that straight through, customer for life experience. From the point in time when they are searching for a home online, to when they are selecting the right product that will meet their family's needs, to automating the origination process, and the manufacturing process of the loans, to an electronic closing, to then the servicing relationship for the life of the loan, and identifying optimal products for that client as their life situation changes. So that's what this transaction is all about, and we look forward to the benefits that we can provide to the end consumer services and originators. Jeff Sprecher : And as you think about what Joe and Ben have talked about of these cross sell opportunities that continues to play into our thesis, that this can be done through recurring licenses. The more you have an end-to-end solution and customers are not having to go buy everything \u00c0 la carte, it allows us to package a really interesting suite of products under licensing arrangements that we think ultimately will be rewarded by the market. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Great! Thanks, good morning! thank for taking my question. Another one on Black Knight of course. Maybe just looking at the TAM, the $14 billion TAM, combined revenue looks like it's, you know it will begin to approach $3 billion out of that $14 billion TAM. So just really only a 20% share I guess. First is that, you view that as a justification for this not being an anti-trust issue given that you're still a minority of the overall TAM. And as you over time penetrate that with a better solution, even if you're the dominant outsourcer, I guess to what extent do you see that market share improvement being incremental to the revenue synergies that you\u2019ve outlined in the 125, and I guess one other question would be, just investment in sales and any other CapEx investments that would be required to change the BKI Technology stack as you mentioned. Ben Jackson : Hi Brian! It's Ben. I\u2019ll take a stab at this. So, when \u2013 and while I was articulating before in terms of the review we did, our lawyers and Black Knight's lawyers have done, you literally quickly come to the conclusion that there's, these businesses are 100% complementary, we don't compete with one another. And that what\u2019s the driver for this deal is that is its really taking for the this first time services across the data space, services in the origination space, in the consumer engagement space, the closing space and then the servicing space, bringing them together to give that complete front to back solution. So and as you peal through it, and as we engage with the regulators, we're very confident they are going to come to the conclusion, but there is a ton of benefits that can come from this, and that also the businesses just flat out don't compete with one another. On the revenue side of it, what we see is that the pie is expanding. Because here the industry is so inefficient, it is the most analog space in asset class that we've seen, as we've been on our journey of taking businesses from analog to digital, that what's really driving this and when you think about that TAM, we are not taking market share from other people, we are taking market share from just complete inefficiency, manual processing and costs that are rising on the end consumer, costs that are rising for servicers and originators and the plan is to bring that all down. So that's you know overall the first part of your question. I know you got a question on CapEx I think as well, and I\u2019ll ask Warren to take that one. Warren Gardiner : Yeah, well in terms of CapEx, I think it was more on the technology side. I missed kind of the end there, but around some of the technology spend. So the CapEx for Black Knight\u2019s been around $100 million annually. I don\u2019t think you should be thinking about it a whole lot different in terms of a run rate for that. There is, because Ben mentioned some incremental spend that we built into the model, both OpEx and CapEx around some of the technology re-platforming that we plan to do over a number of years. We\u2019ve done this plenty of times in the past, whether it's with IDC or New York Stock Exchanges, and so we've got some a pretty good sense about timing and an amount there. And that\u2019s something that we plan to do over the next number of years. So it's really spread out over sort of a three to five to seven if not quite more in the year period. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Sprecher, Chair and CEO. Please go ahead. Jeff Sprecher : Thank you, Betsy, and thank you all for joining us this morning. And I'd like to thank my colleagues for delivering the best quarter in our company's history and I thank our customers for their business in this quarter. And we look forward to updating you again soon as we continue to try to build out very innovative solutions to further advance markets, and deliver compounding growth to our shareholders. Have a great day! Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll now turn the call over to Warren. Warren Gardiner : Thanks MC. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide four with some of the key highlights from our second quarter results. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.32. The 14% increase year-over-year, marking the best second quarter in our company's history, and is on top of 12% growth in the second quarter of 2021. Net revenues totaled $1.8 billion, an increase of 8% versus last year, driven by a balanced contribution from both our diversified transaction revenues and our recurring revenues, which account for over half of our business and increased by 8% versus last year. Second quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $740 million and were at the low end of our guidance range versus the midpoint of our guide, second quarter expenses benefited from favorable FX, various expense efficiencies and lower variable costs, particularly customer acquisition costs and our listings business. Moving to the full year, we're lowering our expense guidance to a range of $2.97 billion to $2.99 billion midpoint to midpoint this represents a reduction of $35 million versus our prior guidance and similar to our second quarter results is driven by expense efficiencies, lower variable costs and favorable FX. Second quarter adjusted operating income increased by 14% to $1.1 billion their adjusted operating margin expanding to 59%. Moving to the balance sheet, shortly after we reported our first quarter results in May, we took the opportunity to raise $8 billion in new SR notes. We used 3 billion of these proceeds to refinance our 2022 and 2023 maturities and along with the proceeds from our sale of Euroclear reduced our commercial paper balances to zero with no maturities until the middle of 2025, we enter the second half of the balance sheet that is well positioned and it's an exceptionally volatile interest rate environment. The remaining $5 billion of proceeds raised in May, is earmarked to fund a portion of our announced acquisition of Black Knight based on a favorable rates that we've secured on these long-term notes, and the current forward rate expectations for both our commercial paper and term loan, we anticipate we will be well within our targeted 4% to 4.5% cost of debt financing for the transaction. It is also worth noting that alongside the financing in May, we maintained our A minus and A3 pre-acquisition ratings from both S&P and Moody's. Now let's move to Slide five, to provide an overview of the performance of our exchange segment. Second quarter exchange net revenues totaling $1 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year, this strong performance was driven by an 80% increase in our interest rate futures, and that's 36% increase in our equity derivatives revenues. Importantly, total open interest, which we believe to be the best indicator of long-term growth, and in July up 11% versus the end of last year, including 6% growth in energy and 21% growth across our financial futures and options complex. Second quarter cash equities and equity options revenue increased by 17% year-over-year, and in July, we successfully migrated the NYCE Arca Options platform to our new pillar technology, while continuing to seamlessly process record message volume, a testament to our team's hard work and our broader technology expertise. Exchange recurring revenues increased by 7% year-over-year. This growth was driven by strong demand in our energy exchange data continued benefit from our record 2021 listings performance and a one-time accrual in our listings business that we do not expect will reoccur in the second half. Turning now to Slide six. In our fixed income and data services segment, second quarter revenue totaled a record $512 million a 13% increase versus a year ago. Transaction revenues increased by 78%, including 85% growth in ICE bonds, and 76% growth in our CDS clearing business. This strong growth was driven in part by customers re-engaging and allocating more capital to CDS trading, as well as our continued efforts to build institutional connectivity through our bond platforms, where we're seeing market share gains and our municipal bond business. Recurring revenue growth, which accounted for over 80% of segment revenues grew 5% in the quarter and was once again driven by strength in our consolidated fees business as well as continued growth in the ICE global network. Looking to the second half, we expect year-over-year growth in our recurring revenues to continue supported by an ASD that interest in the third quarter up over 5% year-over-year. And in that second half as reported recurring revenues, we flat to slightly up versus our first half results driven by your Euronext data center migration which was included in our original guidance and $10 million of additional FX headwinds. Shifting to mortgage technology on Slide seven. Second quarter revenues totaled $297 million. Recurring revenues which accounted for over half of the segment revenues and totaled $160 million in the quarter increased 18% year-over-year. These strong recurring revenues continue to drive outperformance versus an industry that experienced a 40% decline in origination volumes. While the current macroeconomic backdrop is challenging for a number of our customers is also presented an opportunity to have more constructive conversations around efficiency and automation across the mortgage origination workflow. It's worth noting that second quarter unit origination volumes were similar to those in the second quarter of 2019. However, second quarter 2022 revenues in our mortgage technology business were over $100 million greater or up almost 60% when compared to pro forma revenues in 2Q \u00e2\u0080\u009819. This is a clear testament to the continued automation and growth and customer adoption of our solutions across the origination workflow. I'll conclude on Slide eight. To the first half of the year, we've grown total ICE revenue by 7% adjusted operating income by 11%, including 200 basis points of margin expansion and adjusted earnings per share by 12%, representing the best first half in our history. In addition, we've positioned our balance sheet for the acquisition of Black Knight while also growing our dividend and continuing to invest in future growth. As we look to the balance of the year, we're excited about the many growth opportunities in front of us, and we remain focused on creating value for our stockholders. With that, I'll hand it over to Ben. Ben Jackson : Thank you, Warren. And thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide nine. Rising inflation has created an interest rate environment, many of our customers have not navigated in over a decade. Meanwhile, the continued war in Ukraine has triggered a reshaping of the global energy supply chain, creating new risks and uncertainties for market participants. Importantly, we remain focused on connecting customers to our leading technology, mission critical data, and transparent and accessible markets to navigate these uncertain conditions. In our interest rate markets, we've seen record year-to-date volumes in our your  contract as customers increasingly seek to manage risks associated with rising rates and central bank activity across Europe and the U.K. This heightened risk has also contributed to strength in our equity derivatives complex, driving an 18% increase in volumes year-to-date. Across our global energy markets, customers are navigating supply uncertainty alongside longer term Clean Energy Transition priorities. This will continue to introduce additional complexity and volatility to energy markets, which should drive greater demand for risk management. And it is our diverse global energy markets that provide the critical price transparency and risk management tools customers need to navigate both the near-term and long-term complexities. Globalization of gas and the clean energy transition are trends that have contributed to the 43% average annual volume growth in our TTF gas business over the past five years, driving TTF to emerge as a global gas benchmark. Through the first half of this year, as a result of the Russia Ukraine conflict, global gas markets have tightened significantly, increasing the demand for global liquefied natural gas in an uncertain geopolitical environment. This volatility and uncertainty has driven our global gas volumes increased 31% year-to-date, including 49% growth in our North American gas business in the second quarter. Commercial customers continue to rely on our markets to manage their risk, as evidenced by the record share in open interest we've achieved in our Henry Hub contract, surpassing 50% for the first time ever. Because we operate a global gas market with benchmarks across North America, Europe and Asia, we are well positioned to benefit from both the near- term volatility and the long-term secular growth trends occurring across these markets. Despite these global energy concerns, governments, corporates and market participants remain committed to environmental policy to reduce carbon emissions. As such, valuing externalities such as placing a price on pollution, carbon free electricity, and carbon sequestration and storage will continue to increase in importance. ICE has one of the largest networks of environmental products to value such externalities across the carbon cycle, including renewable fuel contracts, carbon allowances, nature-based solutions, and renewable energy certificates. The breadth of our complex, coupled with the growing importance of carbon price transparency, has contributed to the 19% average annual volume growth in our environmental complex over the past five years. As the clean energy transition continues to introduce new complexities, uncertainties and volatility to energy markets, our global environmental alongside our gas and oil complexes will provide the price transparency across the energy spectrum needed to manage these evolving risks. Turning now to our mortgage business. I first want to touch on our pending acquisition of Black Knight as announced on May 4 of this year. As we said, when we made our announcement back then we continued to believe the transaction will close during the first half of 2023. Since the announcement, and in accordance with our initial expected timeline, we have submitted the necessary regulatory filings. We are working with the FTC as they perform their thoughtful and comprehensive reviews of the proposed transaction. Out of respect for the FTC is important work on this matter as we work with them toward regulatory approval, we do not intend to comment further on the transaction. But importantly, we remain very excited about the efficiencies that combined entities will bring to the end consumer and other stakeholders across the mortgage ecosystem. As interest rates rise, and mortgage origination volumes soften from recent record levels, our customers continue to turn to our mission critical technology to operate more efficiently. In the second quarter, we once again grew recurring revenues and outperformed the broader industry. Our focus during these evolving market conditions is first and foremost, our customer. Customer conversations have increasingly centered on efficiencies and automation and we continued to work with our customers to find the most efficient ways they can benefit from the breadth of offerings across our network. For example, we recently made the decision to offer interested customers our base eCO solution included in an Encompass subscription, making it easier and cheaper for customers to adopt and benefit from the efficiencies from an electronic closing. To focus on efficiencies has also led to increased interest in our data and analytics products, leveraging machine learning technology, our analytics platform automates the steps in the loan manufacturing process, and can save lenders 1000s of dollars per loan by reducing manufacturing time and complexity. Year-to-date, our data analytics business, which is made up largely of recurring revenues, has grown 21% year-over-year, we continue to see increased adoption of our analytics and new customers coming onto the platform, with a host of new clients added this year alone represented the likes of Chase, a number of leading independent mortgage bankers, and a top three home builder. We are pleased that the value of our offerings continues to resonate with lenders, and we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity to accelerate the analog to digital conversion happening across the mortgage industry. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Sprecher : Thank you, Ben. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. Please turn to Slide 10. The first half of the year has been marked by rising inflation, rising interest rates and continued geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty. Our customers are navigating evolving risks and continued to rely on our data, technology and liquid markets to manage these risks. In the second quarter, we once again grew revenues, grew adjusted operating income, and grew adjusted earnings per share these record setting second quarter results reflect the strength of our network and the all weather nature of our business model. Our strategy has always been to find unique and novel ways to apply data and technology to bring efficiencies and transparency to markets whether it was moving energy trading to the screen, clearing OTC swaps, modernizing the technology powering the U.S. equity markets, or building datasets for the opaque fixed income markets. As we've grown and diversified, we've broadened our opportunity set and our expertise has grown, providing new markets to grow into, and importantly, new ways to provide innovative solutions to customers. We've leveraged our leading pricing and reference data to build new tools for the front office. We've married our fixed income data to newly expanded climate capabilities. And more recently, we've combined our expertise in futures contract construction, with our index capabilities, and with our unique mortgage data to launch both the ICE mortgage rate lock index and its associated futures contract. These are just a few examples of the innovation that we can deliver with our expanded technology, datasets and expertise. Our evolution has been intentional, diversifying across asset classes and geographies and increasing our mix of recurring revenues with the goal of building a business that today generates compounding earnings growth. It's how we've grown our adjusted earnings per share for the past 15 years in every year that we've been a public company. The net result of our compounding earnings growth is the compounding growth in our dividend, which we've grown double digits each year on average since we initiated it in 2013 and which we also grew 15% in this quarter. Looking now to the second half of the year and beyond, we're excited about the many growth opportunities that are in front of us. And we remain focused on delivering innovative solutions for our customers while driving compounding growth for our stockholders. I'd like to thank our customers for their continued business and their trust and I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contribution to our record second quarter, following on the heels of our best first quarter, making this an unsurpassed first half result for our company. With that, I'll now turn the call back to our moderator Victoria, and will conduct a question-and-answer session until 9 :30 a.m. Eastern Time. Operator : Thank you. We will now start our Q&A session. . And our first question comes from Rich Repetto at Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Rich Repetto : Good morning, Jeff and Ben and Warren. It's unfortunate, we can't get any comments on the Black Knight acquisition, because that's certainly on everybody's mind. But anyway, I'll ask about fixed income. Ben, you saw probably a nice uptick in fixed income execution, I think it's up 85% up 10 million, just quarter-over-quarter. And I would suspect that's just the retail, your retail complex   picking up? And then one other question related to fixed income, the recurring revenues went down quarter-to-quarter just by a million, I suspect that's currency, but just wanted to get some clarification there as well. Jeff Sprecher : Hi, Rich. I'm going to hand it over to Lynn to go through this. Lynn Martin : Hi, Rich. Thanks for the question. You're right that we saw strong growth in our fixed income trading business this quarter. And as mentioned in our prepared remarks that was driven off of strengthened our muni trading business. And while volatility and the return of retail has certainly been a contributor, we're seeing our institutional efforts pay off. As you are aware over the last two years, we really focused on leveraging our market leading assets in the muni ecosystem, including our data assets and our index business, which now serves as the benchmark for more than 60% of the AUM in this area to build out the infrastructure to connect the institutional market to our muni execution platforms. And in this quarter alone, we're seeing the benefits of that work manifest itself. And that institutional share within our muni execution platforms has doubled since 2020, enabling us to take share in the broader muni market. And finally, it's worth noting that our institutional business in munis has grown 250%, year-over-year, a further sign that we're gaining share in this asset class. Warren Gardiner : And then, Rich, its Warren on your question on the recurring revenues. You're right. That's FX, largely FX, there's also a little bit of AUM related revenue in our ETF business. So as we saw during the quarter people shifting into treasuries and out of equities, and some of the credit focused ETFs. There's lower economics on those treasury ETFs that we bent that track our benchmarks and so that was a little bit of a mix shift impact for us as well within the AUM portion of the index. The rest of the index business did really well during the quarter up double digits. Again, some of the subscription revenue, pure subscription revenue, if you will, in there. So really just kind of the macro dynamics taking hold there that why you saw that slight sequential decline. Rich Repetto : Got it. Thanks for the update. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm at UBS. Please go ahead. Alex Kramm : Yes. Hey, good morning. Lots of info you gave already on the mortgage side. But we'd like to dig a little bit deeper in particular on the recurring side. So few questions here. One I don't know if you gave an update to the recurring revenue guide for that segment that would be interested if that's still unchanged, but then more importantly, I think you mentioned that even like some of the challenges in the end markets you are seeing some bankruptcies, et cetera. So maybe you could give us an update what you're seeing in terms of customer losses, and maybe remind us how the revenue model is if there's any receipts, et cetera. And then, sorry, lastly, maybe give us a little bit of the algorithm of growth that you've seen so far in the recurring revenues year-to-date between customer losses, but then also some of the upsells that you guys were talking about earlier. And then, also this continued shift to moving the contract terms to more recurring, so I know that's a mouthful, but hopefully I get out of it. Ben Jackson : Yes, that's a lot Alex. This is Ben. I'll start and Warren will also I'm sure add in here. So in terms of, I'll start with this, just the overall challenges in the environment. If you take a step back, and you look at what we're building, we're building a business here that in mortgage whether a number of different market environments with an eye towards an 8% to 10% growth over the long-haul. And why are we confident in our ability to do that is the reasons are one we have absolutely mission critical software for these clients that we're providing. We have long-term contracts with our clients, four to five years of the high amount of retention in them. And we are heavily focused, as you've seen in our results, on shifting the revenue to more and more towards recurring. And we did it again this quarter, on the backdrop of 40% down market in terms of volumes, with 18% year-over-year recurring revenue growth in the business. The other Proofpoint, you've seen in terms of being able to weather various market environments is our data analytics line item. With that being up 36% last quarter alone. And one of the key inputs and drivers to that is our AIQ and analyzer solutions, we're seeing tremendous uptake in that we're seeing clients now more than ever just looking to adopt automation to automate as much of the workflow as possible to lower their costs. And the other proof point I put out, there was a comment Warren made in his prepared remarks, in that if you look at Q2 of 2019, very similar volume environment to what we saw in this past quarter, we generated more than $100 million of revenue on a pro forma basis. And that's, what enables us to do as we do time studies, with our clients, and clients that adopt our full automation suite, we see are saving anywhere from 570 to $1,400 per loan that they're manufacturing when they adopt our solutions. So our ability to capture some benefit from that from the efficiencies that we're providing to the industry has been tremendous. In terms of the algorithm of growth, on recurring revenue, it's really -- it's a mix that we've described before, it's a mix of, there is some pricing in there, there is sales to new clients. So I mentioned, we had a good start of the year for sales on Encompass. We've had a good sales for the year on our AIQ business. And then also the other input is that shift as customers are renewing that shift of -- even if we have to forego some transaction revenue of moving more to subscription, we're continuing to do that, and have a lot of success. And we're still early days, we're really in the first year of a codified program to do that. And with contracts with clients going four to five years in the future we have a long runway to go. Warren Gardiner : Alex, this is Warren, you asked about the guidance. So yes, you're correct. There's no change to the guidance that we gave to start the year. We did assume, as we said back then that there will be some headwinds from people potentially going out of business or maybe not as many new market participants, I'll say I'm highly confident that to the extent that starts to play out, that's going to be a cyclical trend, not a secular one, because I think if you think about the process for and this is reiterating what Ben just said, we think about the rest of getting a mortgage, it continues to be very costly for the consumer, it's very inefficient. And we have the tools that are -- building the tools that are really solving those problems. And so I know that probably doesn't help, solve for 2022, EPS or 2023 EPS, but it should really factor into kind of the multiple people are thinking about when you're valuing the overall enterprise at the end of the day. Alex Kramm : So you haven't seen a lot of impact from cancellations at this point, just to clarify. Ben Jackson : Hey, Alex. It's Ben again. So we have seen a small, small number of lenders that have had some challenges and potentially go out of business, but it's a very small number that we've seen so far. Alex Kramm : Very good. Thank you. Operator : Perfect. Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt at KBW. Please go ahead. Kyle Voigt : Hi, good morning. So last quarter, you spoke about energy traders moving away from using futures and towards options at least for oil specifically, just given the decline in oil futures open interest throughout 2Q it seemed like that trend may have continued. Just wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing from commodity trading firms right now trying to manage risk in an extremely volatile environment. Because I guess given the volatility, we've seen the market, it's a bit surprising to see energy volumes only up 3% in the second quarter and now seemingly kind of trending lower year-on-year into the third quarter. Thank you. Ben Jackson : Hey, Kyle, it's Ben. So you have a -- we have a confluence of issues that are going on around the world that are really unprecedented. And against that backdrop, we're pleased that our overall, our overall futures business is up for year-over-year in terms of open interest and since the end of the year, and our energy businesses up in open interest since the end of the year, given all of these events. And what are we looking at, we're looking at an inflationary environment, we're looking at a recession, you've got in particular in Europe, governments in Europe, have to figure out the balance between sanctions against Russia, the impact of those sanctions against their civilians, in terms of near-term price impact on energy, and move towards cleaner energy. So you've got this pothole mix and then you also have in China continued COVID lockdowns that are happening, and obviously geopolitical tensions happening with China. So given all those issues, we believe that our marketplace has been set up as best as can be in the in the world to help clients navigate through all of these events, and they're utilizing us to do that. And I'll give a few examples. So first, we have one of the most deep and liquid markets across that energy spectrum. So think of oil, gas, LNG, power and environmentals. So as clients are looking to move and switch between fuels, looking towards, moving towards a cleaner environment, we are the exchange and clearing businesses that they're going to do that. Second, in managing global supply shocks, you have deep -- we have deep liquid global markets in each of those respective asset classes that I mentioned with oil, gas, LNG, power, and environmentals and enable customers because we have all these deep liquid points at the points of production and consumption, as clients need to hedge their risks using different risk management tools. We're very well positioned to do that. And a perfect example is right now with Russia, stifling gas supplies going into Europe, we are seeing U.S. step in and U.S. providing natural gas via LNG cargos going into Northern Europe. And given that we are the home to the vast majority of commercial traders, that trade our U.S. gas products, both Henry Hub and our bases markets, we're seeing clients use that to hedge those cargos. And it's one of the inputs that's led to what I mentioned in my prepared remarks of the record we've seen in market share from a Henry Hub perspective, as well as a North American gas and at a highest well in the global gas complex. The third thing I'd point out is that we're engaged as much as ever with clients and governments around the world around the sanctions and as they're taking shape. And there's no question it had some impact, as there was uncertainty as to how issues would play out in products like gas and oil, where Russian fuel oil is an input into that historically, as governments have made it clear that as of February of 23, Russian fuel oil will no longer be provided, it no longer be consumed in Europe, we've changed the specification on our gas oil contract. And now we started to see open interest in volume starting to build again in gas oil, calendar 23 and beyond. And then you pointed out, our deep liquid options market. So options is clearly one of the most efficient ways to hedge geopolitical tail risk because it helps to hedge a number of different scenarios that could play out and embrace our volume in open or volume in Brent options, year-over-year is up 25%. So when you look at me stand your lens and look at the overall energy complex. We feel really good about how we're positioned. Kyle Voigt : Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler at Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Craig Siegenthaler : Hey, good morning, everyone. So my question is on mortgage tech origination revenues were down not that surprising. But you help us with some perspective on incremental downside from current levels. And also, in terms of timing, when should we think these revenues will stabilize? And any perspective on that relative to what rates are doing would be helpful too? Ben Jackson : Hey, Craig, it's Ben, I'll start. So basically reiterate some of the things that I said before, when you widen out what our strategy is, within the mortgage and mortgage technology business, our strategy here has been to move more and more of the revenue towards recurring to take some of that cyclicality out of the business and we continue to do that. And we've been successfully doing that. In terms of predicting the rate environment and how that's going to play out just look at how the rate environments played out over the last week, it's been extraordinarily hard for to see and be able to predict when that this volume environment and stuff will settle down. But despite that, we're going to continue to make investments in the innovation that we're providing to our clients. As we mentioned, a lot of the investments that we made is what fueled that $100 million growth that we saw over the last three years in a similar environment to what we had in 2019. Those are investments -- those investments are in and around everything that we've been doing in the closing side, our simple file business continues to gain market share and do very well. And then all of the innovation that we've been introducing on the data and analytics side with our AIQ platform, as well as the automation of the underwrite platform, we see that those are all tailwinds that regardless of the rate environment and the volume environment that our growth drivers for us. Jeff Sprecher : And this is Jeff, let me just mention that a lot of our mortgage strategy is driven by the fact that we're trying to really position the company to be an all weather named that in all interest rate and macroeconomic environments that I can continue to end my prepared remarks on the same page that shows a graph of compounding earnings growth, for shareholders. And having a U.S. mortgage strategy gives us exposure we own LIBOR, which is the London Interbank index we trade U.K. and EU interest rate futures. We have a credit default swap business that is completely global that includes Russian sovereign, hedging and companies across the globe. We have a fixed income business that is truly global, we provide pricing data in almost every single country that has bond issuance. And we were relatively thin on having exposure to U.S. interest rates, and moving into mortgage gives us that. I also think, when we step back and look at the mortgage complex, the U.S. mortgage complex, and the way we're building the business, is that there is a demographic of millennials, that is huge, that are underserved by homeownership. And there's been supply chain issues during COVID to meet housing. And we generally believe that that any house that gets built will be sold and that there will be a mortgage on it, and that the supply chain issues are getting better and that the underperformance of building is increasing. We also have seen from our limited ownership of having mortgage assets that cash out refinancings happen when the value of homes go up, and which is an inflationary input. And the one that I think a lot of people and maybe is at the root of your question focus on is the absolute interest rate, which leads to people refinancing in a declining interest rate market. Long story short is there are a number of inputs into the housing market. We want to have exposure to the U.S. interest rate environment. It's going to help plus built in all weather name. And even with a downturn in the number of U.S. mortgages, we've had the best second quarter in our company's history. Craig Siegenthaler : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking my question. Just a two-parter on the environmental initiatives. So maybe Ben, if you could just comment on within the energy complex, obviously, we're seeing very good strength in that gas. We did see a couple quarters now sequential declines in the environmental so the question there is, our customers substituting that gas for some of the environmental versus something else driving on the environmental side short-term? And then, the second part of the question is, if you could comment on this, maybe Lynn, but on the acquisition of Urgentem and the overall climate data strategy, whether you're seeking to get more to grow substantially in that business linking that into the data more heavily into the environmental trading side? Ben Jackson : Got it. Thanks, Brian. Yes, I'll start and then I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll hand it to Lynn for the second part of that. So as I mentioned before, there's this confluences issues going on, in particular in Europe and where we have seen some impacts, so the balance between Russia and sanctions and the impact on the civilians and the move to cleaner energy. In Europe in specifically, we have seen some time and attention from traders that would trade things like our EUA markets, our European Union Allowances, moving and shifting more towards just the acute energy issues that everyone's faced with right now. So we have seen some headwinds in that part. But the flip side of it is in North America, we've had a very strong business continuing to do very, very well. North America is doing well and our Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiatives, our California Carbon Allowances, our renewable fuels, our REC markets, each of these are doing very, very well and we're continuing to invest. So we recently launched Biofuel Contracts they're doing well, we recently launched a global index, a Global Carbon Index Future, as well and we're getting more and more on the index itself we're getting more ETS to license and on futures are starting to develop there. We recently launched Texas Wind and Solar contracts, we recently launched nature-based offset contracts for the voluntary markets. So we see a lot of tailwinds coming in the foreseeable future, and you also have other developments like State of Pennsylvania likely to join Reggie  and Washington State likely to put in their Cap and Trade Program for the first time. So we have a lot of good tailwinds there in North America. And I think what you're seeing in the overall complex is just a wait little bit on the EUA market in Europe. Lynn Martin : And thanks, Brian, for the follow-up question. So given the strength in our fixed income data, we're uniquely positioned to add transparency around ESG, really focused on the climate risk. Given our ability to tie alternative datasets into datasets that the market knows you've seen us further position this offering. In Q4, we announced the acquisition of risQ and Level 11, which enabled us to execute on the opportunity to turn physical climate data into actionable insights starting with our muni bond service, but more recently expanding into the mortgage-backed securities market. And now we have the ability to offer a parcel level information measured by geographic coordinates in the U.S., and we plan to expand that globally. And then, finally, as you know we recently announced the purchase of our Gen10, which really expands our climate risk offering to include corporate transition risk, given its coverage of 30,000 public and private companies, which was an attractive dataset to us to add to the climate offering. Brian Bedell : That's great color. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Michael Cyprys : Great, thanks so much. Wanted to ask about the commodities franchise, just curious how you guys are thinking about the longer-term growth drivers there, what factors ultimately drive volumes higher in your commodities franchise, is it production of the underlying commodities, for example, some more oil and gas rigs, producing more oil and gas are going to drive volumes higher over the long-term? Just curious how you think about those growth drivers and the algorithm and how is that evolving? Thank you. Ben Jackson : Thanks, Michael. This is Ben. And the way we think about it is, we need to have as I described earlier, that breadth of offerings of global offerings across the each of the inputs into producing energy is, as the statistics that are out there point to energy consumption doubling between now and 2050. And it's just what are the inputs into the production of that energy are going to change and will change over-time. And we believe with the breadth of offerings that we have across oil, gas, LNG, power and then the significant early start that we had and thinking about the environmental markets with the acquisition of the Climate Exchange over a decade ago, we're very well positioned to help clients navigate through that. So that's one input into it. You do have a global focus on the reduction of carbon emissions around the world and as I said before, with our environmental markets, we are very well positioned to help clients navigate through that. So those are two. I think the third is that even though we have had some near-term headwinds in some of the products in Europe in particular the ones that have been at the center of this Ukraine, Russia situation we continue to see user growth. So we continue to see more and more users taking data subscriptions and coming onto the platform to get visibility into what's happening in those markets, how those markets correlate, or de-correlate at times to others around the world. So when we look at the underlying health of the market, looking at user growth, looking at open interest and looking at the global breadth of the offerings that we provide to our clients, those are all inputs into our growth outlook . Michael Cyprys : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our final question is a follow-up from Rich Repetto of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Rich Repetto : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Just one last question on mortgage, and this I think is more for Jeff. In the prepared remarks, it was mentioned about efficiency and automation and how the downturn is maybe emphasizing that more in the mortgage segment. But I guess the question, Jeff is, I think people are really looking for the connection between mortgage and how that can automate overtime as you've done so in other markets. So the question is, how is it comparing given that mortgage has a longer workflow process, but what you are seeing so far in regards to the automation of the market longer term versus the other asset classes you've dealt with? Jeff Sprecher : Sure, that's a great question Rich, because I'm a company founder, I get asked to speak to entrepreneurs from time-to-time and I always tell them, the best time to start a business is when there's a downturn and not that having us moved into this space, you wish a downturn on anybody, but it's very, very hard to get people in finance and I say this broadly, whether it's trading, clearing, data, acquisition it is very, very hard to get people in finance to change their behavior when they're making a lot of money and when things are going well. And the best time to get people to think about making a change is when their businesses are under pressure and Ben alluded to that a number of times in why our subscription revenues are doing well in the mortgage space. Broadly speaking again, I appreciate the question. I know you've followed our company for many years, and you see us putting data and analytic tools into the mortgage market. The mortgage market that we're talking a lot about is the cash market. You've seen us and I mentioned in my prepared remarks, launch our first derivative product against in a new index that we created. And so I think this space has a lot of inefficiencies throughout the entire, not just the manufacturing the mortgage, but the way mortgages are financed and traded and retreated in the secondary market, very poor data available due to the paper based nature of the contract, difficult to regulate for regulate regulators, regulators think that there may be biases in the market, but without the right data, it's very hard to know, it's very hard to correct for the participants in the market, very expensive for consumers, banks that spend a lot of money to court a consumer, tend to lose them when there's a refinancing or a change in that client's behavior. The market is not very thoughtful about keeping connectivity between those that lend and those that borrow and all of that I think is fertile ground for us and may go for decades, honestly as we build out the infrastructure. But at the core, we need a foundation of data and information that borrowers, that lenders and that regulators can all look at and use to make it easier. I think I may have mentioned to you even that, it's odd to me that you can buy a completely consumable good, you can buy toothpaste on an online platform and when you go to checkout it'll ask you if you want to buy now and pay later, knowing that an algorithm underwrote your credit against no collateral and yet, it takes almost two months for somebody to refinance a mortgage in a house that they live in, that has a foundation that's in the ground that has an address that you can see from space that is part of the Maslow's hierarchy of need of safety and security and will be abandoned by that person, the last thing they do. And yet we, an existing mortgage talking to their bank takes two months. It just something is wrong in those equations. And we could argue that by now pay later lending maybe too generous, but certainly 60 days to do work with an existing client than an existing home just feels too long. And that's, that is the challenge that I think we will tackle successfully and put the entire industry on a better footing. Rich Repetto : Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. Operator : Thank you for your question. We have received a follow up from Kyle Voigt at KBW. Please go ahead. Kyle Voigt : Thanks for taking my follow up. So a question on the OTC and other revenue line in the exchange segment was quite strong in the quarter. I just want to confirm that the increase that we saw there was really driven by collateral fees that ICE is clearing house or is there something else that was driving that? And can you remind us if those collateral fees are entirely fixed basis point fees, or if there is or will be any benefit from rate hikes we've seen in the U.S. and EU? Warren Gardiner : So hey, Kyle, it's Warren. So in terms of the OTC and other yes, you're correct that the performance there has been collateral driven that's largely from net interest income or earning at ICE Future or ICE Clear U.S. and ICE Clear Europe and so as collateral bounces move around and you've seen that over the course of this year. That's obviously going to benefit that particular line item. In terms of rates moving higher, we do have a benefit from that that's going to show up there more on -- will show up on the CDS clearing side because we do park some collateral funds there as a Fed. And so we do get a benefit as collateral moves up, but then also as Fed funds rates move up there and so that's part of the strong performance you've seen in CDS there. So, not in that OTC and other line but in the spirit of your question, yes, that there's a benefit from better rate hikes coming through over-time. Kyle Voigt : Understood. Thanks. Operator : Thank you for your question, Kyle. This concludes our Q&A session. And now I'd like to pass over to Chair CEO, Jeff Sprecher for any final remarks. Jeff Sprecher : Thank you, Victoria. Thank you all for joining us this morning. Let me again thank my colleagues for delivering yet another record quarter and we very much appreciate and want to say thank you to our customers for putting your faith in us during the quarter. We'll look forward to updating you again soon as we continue to execute on these exciting growth opportunities that we mentioned on the call. And with that, I hope you'll have a great day. Operator : Thank everyone for joining today's call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I'll now hand over to your host, Katia Gonzalez, Investor Relations Senior Analyst, to begin. Katia, please go ahead. Katia Gonzalez : Good morning. ICE's third quarter 2022 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2021 Form 10-K, third quarter Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC. In addition, as we announced in May, ICE has agreed to acquire Black Knight. The transaction is pending customary regulatory approval and we expect to close in the first half of 2023. In connection with the proposed transaction, ICE has filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 to register the shares of ICE common stock to be issued in connection with the transaction. The registration statement includes a proxy statement of Black Knight that also constitutes a prospectus of ICE. Please see the Form S-4 filing for additional information regarding the transaction. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP terms in the earnings materials. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, references to revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain items. With us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chair and CEO; Warren Gardiner, Chief Financial Officer; Ben Jackson, President; and Lynn Martin, President of the NYSE. I'll now turn the call over to Warren. Warren Gardiner : Thanks, Katia. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our third quarter results. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 4% to $1.31 which is on top of 30% growth in the third quarter of 2021 and marked the best third quarter in our company's history. Third quarter net revenues totaled a record $1.8 billion, up 3% year-over-year. While transaction revenues were flat on a year-over-year basis, our recurring revenues which accounted for over half of our business, increased by 6% with all 3 of our business segments contributing to the strong year-over-year growth. Third quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $727 million and were $16 million below the low end of our guidance. These better-than-expected results were driven by favorable FX trends, continued operating efficiencies and a handful of nonrecurring items within professional services, SG&A and technology. Shifting to the fourth quarter. We now expect adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $730 million to $740 million, with the increase relative to the third quarter largely reflecting the reversal of onetime items. As you begin to think about 2023 expenses, the midpoint of our current full year guidance or roughly $2.948 billion is a reasonable base to build upon. Despite the dynamic and uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, the diversity and importantly, durability of our business has enabled us to invest through cycles. And while taking the current inflationary backdrop into consideration, we expect to once again invest in our people and the many medium- and long-term growth opportunities that exist across our expanded business. Third quarter adjusted operating income totaled $1.1 billion, up over 6% year-over-year and is on top of 13% pro forma growth in 2021, while adjusted operating margin expanded by nearly 180 basis points to approximately 60%. Through the first 3 quarters of 2022, adjusted free cash flow has totaled over $2.1 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Now, let's move to Slide 5 where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Third quarter Exchange net revenues totaled $1 billion, an increase of 8% year-over-year. In addition to higher levels of collateral at our clearinghouses and thus higher member interest revenues, this strong performance was driven by a 54% increase in our interest rate futures, a 23% increase in our equity derivatives and a 13% increase in cash equities and options revenues. Importantly, total open interest which we believe to be the best indicator of longer-term growth, ended October up 11% versus the end of last year, including 7% growth in energy and 18% growth across our financial futures and options complex. Recurring revenues increased by 5% year-over-year. This growth was driven by strong demand for our energy exchange data and a continued benefit from our record 2021 listings performance. While recent market volatility has led to a pause in new Listings business, both the backlog and our conversations with potential partners remains robust. And through the end of October, a record 19 corporations, representing a combined market cap of nearly $40 billion, have chosen to transfer to the NYSE. Turning now to Slide 6. In our Fixed Income and Data Services segment, third quarter revenues totaled a record $534 million, a 14% increase versus a year ago. Transaction revenues increased by 84%, including 122% growth in ICE bonds and 75% growth in our CDS clearing business. Similar to last quarter, this strong growth was driven by market volatility and rising interest rates, customers allocating additional capital to CDS trading and our continued efforts to build institutional connectivity to our bond platforms. Recurring revenues, excluding the Euronext migration, grew by 4% in the quarter driven by demand for additional capacity on the ICE Global Network as well as double-digit growth in both our consolidated feeds business and our derivative analytics. Somewhat offsetting the strength were asset-based revenues in our index business which declined by double digits year-over-year as investors shifted out of higher fee risk assets such as equities, munis and corporate bonds and into treasury ETFs. In addition, extended fixed income market volatility is also impacting growth in a portion of our end-of-day fixed income pricing business as reduced new issuance has driven slower growth in the number of outstanding bonds available to be priced. Absent a sharp reversal of these macro trends, we'd expect fourth quarter growth to be similar to our third quarter performance. Shifting to Mortgage Technology on Slide 7. Third quarter revenues totaled $276 million. Recurring revenues which accounted for nearly 60% of segment revenues and totaled a record $163 million in the quarter, increased 14% year-over-year. These strong recurring revenues continue to drive outperformance versus an industry that experienced a nearly 60% decline in origination volumes. Importantly, data and analytics revenue increased 22% year-over-year with underlying recurring revenue increasing by over 40%. Similar to last quarter, it's worth noting that industry unit origination volumes were similar to those in the first quarter of 2019. However, our third quarter 2022 Mortgage Technology revenues were over $100 million greater, growing at a CAGR of approximately 17% when compared to the pro forma revenues in 1Q '19. This is a clear testament to the continued automation and growth and customer adoption of our solutions across the origination workflow. I'll conclude my remarks on Slide 8. Year-to-date, we've grown ICE revenue by 6%, adjusted operating income by 10% and our adjusted earnings per share by 9%, representing the best year-to-date performance in our company's history. Despite dramatically different macroeconomic environments, over a 3-year period, you will see a similar story of compounding growth with ICE revenues increasing at a CAGR of 8%, operating income at 11% and EPS of 12%, again, a testament to the resilience and durability of our platform and the all-weather nature of our business model. As we look to the balance of this year -- of the year, we're excited about the many growth opportunities in front of us and remain focused on creating value for our stockholders. With that, I'll hand it over to Ben. Ben Jackson : Thank you, Warren and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 9. In our financial markets, rising inflation and central bank activity across Europe and the U.K. continued to drive increased hedging activity with interest rate average daily volumes increasing 40% year-over-year in the third quarter, including record Euribor futures. In our equity derivatives complex, ADV in our MSCI complex was up 17% in the third quarter as volatility levels continue to be elevated versus the prior year. In our energy markets, the third quarter was marked with the confluence of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties that, when combined with high price volatility, made for a difficult trading environment. Despite these uncertain conditions, we have seen strength in areas like our options markets, our North American gas business and our North American environmental complex. Options contracts are a valuable tool in highly uncertain market conditions due to the ability to manage geopolitical tail risk and the lower associated capital requirements as we've seen historically. With open interest up 29% versus the end of last year, we are pleased that our customers continue to turn to our deep liquid options markets to manage their risk. The evolving energy supply chain in Europe is increasing the demand for global liquefied natural gas sourced from the United States, driving price volatility in our North American gas markets. Our commercial customers continue to rely on our markets to manage their risk, contributing to a 23% volume growth in our North American gas business year-to-date and an all-time record in North American gas open interest as we have gained 500 basis points of market share over the past year versus our peers. Finally, although our European carbon markets are seeing headwinds due to the aforementioned factors, we continue to see growth in active participants in this market with participation up 7% year-over-year. At the same time, the secular trend towards cleaner energy is also driving growth in our North American environmental markets with volumes up 6% year-over-year in the third quarter. And because we offer the broadest suite of environmental products across the carbon cycle, we remain excited about our position to serve customers as they navigate the journey to cleaner energy and as the demand for transparent pricing in carbon grows. Importantly, as we look out over the longer term, we believe that the 3 secular drivers across our energy markets remain intact : First, increasing energy demand; second, an evolving energy supply chain; and third, the clean energy transition. And because we operate deep liquid markets across the globe with benchmarks in emerging markets across every source of energy, we feel very well positioned to benefit from these factors. Moving to our Fixed Income and Data Services business; we delivered record revenues which grew 14% year-over-year. Our comprehensive fixed income and data platform continues to deliver compounding revenue growth underpinned by both our recurring and transaction revenues, a testament to the strategic diversification of our business model and our ability to deliver growth through an array of macroeconomic environments. Turning now to our Mortgage business. In the third quarter, our Mortgage business once again outperformed the broader industry driven by strong recurring revenues. The strength and resiliency that we've seen in recurring revenues has been driven by our new customers continuing to adopt our digital solutions, increased demand for our data and analytics tools and continued strong retention. Our customers remain focused on automation and efficiencies. This focus has led to increased interest in our data and analytics products, contributing to a 22% growth year-to-date in our data and analytics business. Through our AIQ solution and analyzer tools, customers can save thousands of dollars per loan by leveraging our artificial intelligence and machine learning tools to drive automation in the loan manufacturing process. We are pleased that the value of our offerings continues to resonate with lenders and we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity to leverage our mission-critical technology and data expertise to accelerate the analog to digital conversion happening in the industry. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Sprecher : Thank you, Ben. I want to start my prepared remarks by highlighting our vision of how ICE is contributing to both the U.S. home mortgage and U.S. equity markets to bring increased efficiencies to consumers in these 2 asset classes. To take you back, ICE was initially founded to build and operate digital commodity exchanges. Modern digital exchanges provide an essential service, efficiently matching buyers and sellers with operational neutrality. Our modern exchanges are regulated. But more importantly, their growth and efficacy depend on the industry's trust of our neutrality. ICE does not take a position on the price of any commodity or security. We simply provide the software and network that efficiently facilitates a buyer and seller finding one another and allows them to determine their transaction price. Today, millions of traders, investors, brokers and regulators around the world are attached to our exchange networks. And they all benefit from the transparency and standardization that we enable. We followed up our launch into the exchange business by building digital data networks to disperse information separate from our exchanges, networks that thrive on the neutrality and confidentiality of our data management. It is likely obvious to you that our data networks would contain financial information generated by our own exchanges but it may be less obvious that our growth has been accelerated by opening these networks to third parties, including most of our global exchange competitors who also access our customer base. Today, hundreds of third-party exchanges, brokers and market data generators publish their data to users across our networks. Our growth in the U.S. mortgage industry builds on the same management tenets : trust, transparency and neutrality. Our mortgage software and network are open and impartial. ICE has been at the forefront of building a mortgage platform so that industry participants can better communicate with one another, reduce their costs, pass these savings on to consumers in the form of better prices and appropriately implement the government's homeownership policies. And it is in this vein that we have agreed to acquire Black Knight to connect their market participants to ours, open up its platform, reduce cost per mortgage origination, overlay the safety and soundness practices that we've developed for businesses like the systemically important New York Stock Exchange and create new products and services for lenders to increase homeownership, including in underserved communities. As a part of the budget that we previously guided you to, ICE plans a significant financial outlay to open and upgrade the Black Knight technology stack, a commitment that we believe would have been hard for Black Knight's other potential acquirers to make potentially in a contracting mortgage environment. This is the same strategy and commitment that we made when taking over the Mortgage Electronic Registrations System which today has durable and scalable operations and technology built by ICE, systems that are prepared to manage the difficult risk environments in the U.S. housing market. And as shown on Slide 10, these MERS processes can identify and deregister failed lending firms who become zombies to borrowers and regulators. You may have recently heard Sandra Thompson, the Federal Housing Finance Agency's Director, lamenting how stakeholders in the mortgage manufacturing process seemingly lack the will to adopt technology that changes their entrenched methods. This is precisely the challenge that ICE is laser-focused on solving. Gillian Tett pointed out in her book, The Silo Effect, that the U.S. mortgage industry is so siloed that the federal government's past attempts to help troubled homeowners stay in their homes by reducing mortgage payments actually exacerbated the foreclosure problem because lenders lowered monthly payments and servicers mistook this as consumers falling behind and initiated foreclosure proceedings. As Austin Gulsby once said, the silos were so strong, they did the exact opposite of what everyone expected. With the explosive growth of the fintech industry over the last decade, the U.S. has seen a dramatic upsurge in the number of alternative home lenders and mortgage technology providers who, like ICE, are building solutions to benefit lenders and borrowers. Slide 10 also shows the number of new lending firms that just this year have registered to do business with MERS. And surprisingly, the number of lending firms have increased in a year where consumer demand for mortgages has decreased. This increased lender competition presents opportunities for ICE to take costs out of the mortgage manufacturing process so that these lenders can compete more effectively, passing no savings on to borrowers. The high cost of manufacturing and funding a home mortgage that we target are particularly acute for the most marginalized borrowers which further exacerbates the wealth divide in the United States. Our acquisition of Black Knight remains subject to review by the Federal Trade Commission. ICE has provided the FTC with extensive information and certified its completeness. And as is often customary, we agreed to extend the FTC's statutory review period and intend to continue ICE's cooperation with the FTC staff. Our estimate is that the Black Knight merger will close in the first half of next year. While we'll be unable to answer any questions on this call relating to our transaction with Black Knight, please note that our participation in this FTC review, coupled with the comprehensive conversations that we've been having with our customer base, has further convinced us that our merger will afford significant benefits to U.S. homeowners and industry stakeholders. And while on the subject of regulators, I'd like to comment on the recent remarks from the Securities and Exchange Commission focused on the structure of the U.S. equities market. In his June 8 speech, Chair Gensler noted the key elements of the national market system rules haven't been updated since year 2005. And since that time, the U.S. equity markets have become increasingly opaque. Today, most retail order flow is executed through off-exchange bilateral trading relationships with a small number of wholesalers. These wholesalers are able to trade against customers without exposing those orders to competition. In some cases, wholesalers pay retail brokers for the privilege of this first look at their clients' order flow. This practice is known as price improvement and it refers to occasions where trade is made at prices better than the national best bid and offer ticker displayed by the public exchanges, trades that often contain fractions less than 1 whole penny per share. What's often left out of this price improvement narrative, however, is the fact that public exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange under current SEC rules are actually prohibited from displaying orders at price increments less than 1 whole penny. As a result, public investors are, in fact, prevented from narrowing the national best bid and offer ticker to sub-penny price increments. But ask yourself this; is the national best bid and offer ticker really the best market price that we should all be relying upon if investors can routinely buy a share of stock cheaper than what's displayed? We measure the opportunity for investor price improvement savings to the tune of $1.8 billion a year if there were a simple harmonization of the quote and trade increments across the entire market. We hope that this opportunity will be considered by the SEC. ICE has been consistent in its strategy of promoting standardization, fair, transparent markets and networks using state-of-the-art technology. We embrace opportunities to transform businesses to create efficiencies and lower customer costs, not only in home mortgage but even in a 230-year-old business like the New York Stock Exchange. I'll conclude my remarks on Slide 11. The third quarter of this year has been marked by rising inflation, fluctuating interest rates and central bank activity, concerns over energy and food security and global political uncertainty. And I can't think of any firm that has been better positioned to help manage these risks than ICE. Our customers rely on our data, technology and liquid markets to navigate through this environment. In the third quarter, we once again grew revenues, grew adjusted operating income and grew adjusted earnings per share. These record-setting third quarter results against our extraordinary third quarter results of last year reflect the all-weather nature of our business model. We have intentionally positioned the company to provide customer solutions in numerous geographies and economic conditions to facilitate all-weather results. I'd like to end by thanking our customers for their continued business and their trust. And I want to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contribution to this record third quarter following up on our unsurpassed first half results. And with that, I'll now turn the call back to our moderator, Charlie. And we'll conduct a question-and-answer session until 9 :30 Eastern Time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Richard Repetto of Piper Sandler. Richard Repetto : First, thanks for the comparison one on the Mortgage Technology performance versus unit originations. That's helpful. But as we dig in, you outperformed again against unit origination. Can you give us a little bit more detail on which lines in the -- outperform like data analytics, we'd expect that to be 100% recurring and that's been outperforming. But like the other has been flat and we expect that to be all variable. So the question is what's getting you to outperform the unit originations and within which lines in mortgage? Ben Jackson : Sure. Rich, it's Ben. So as you can appreciate, our whole hypothesis on this deal and what we've been doing in the mortgage space is all directed towards a long-term view of taking one of the most analog asset classes that there are and turning it digital. And that's what we believe over the long term, it will enable us to achieve that 8% to 10% growth. And the contributors underneath that are really -- we're very focused on product innovation and in particular, helping our lender customers, lower cost become more efficient. And as we do that, we're hoping that the savings that those lenders achieve are then brought down to their clients, the end consumer and will translate into better selection. It will help to lower cost for the end consumer. It will help enable them to get the best products at the most efficient prices to meet their needs and achieve the dream of homeownership. So that's from a long-term perspective what our focus has been and where we're making our investments. Overall, what's driving our ability to beat is the intentional shift towards subscription revenue. So if you look across each of the segments that we have, we're pushing very hard to move more and more of the revenue in each of those reporting segments more towards subscription when we can. And one of the things I'll highlight in terms of success this last quarter, even with all the headwinds that the industry has had, 2/3 of the customers that renewed in the third quarter renewed at higher subscription base levels by the end of that quarter than they were at, at the beginning of the quarter. The other thing I'd say is that it is -- it has been a difficult environment. It has been a difficult environment. And despite that, we only saw a single -- small single-digit percentage of our clients not renew and most of that's due to M&A industry consolidation and closing up shop. But one of the things we've seen as a positive for us with some of the backdrop of this industry consolidation as some of these companies and their employees have been downsized, some of these impacted personnel have used it as an opportunity to become an entrepreneur and start a new lending shop. And those are opportunities that we compete for and we've won some of that business on Encompass this past quarter. So we've seen sales success in origination on Encompass, both in the smaller start-up companies, the mid-market as well as banks. So that said, a lot of what's going on in our origination process, our origination line item and reporting line item as well as the fact as we've moved more and more of that revenue to our subscription and we have very low attrition. In the data and analytics area, what's really fueling our ability to beat there is the same. So data and analytics does have historically a transaction element to it. We have been moving this line item very similar to our origination line item more and more towards subscription as clients renew. And as we sign new clients, make sure that we're tilting those deals much more towards subscription revenue. And the big piece of products that we have in that area is a product called AIQ. That's the product that's automating a lot of the underwriting processes and that's a big area of where today, we're generating around $1,400 of savings in originating a loan. A lot of it is anchored in this area of automating the underwriting process for our customers. I mentioned that in the second quarter, we signed JPMorgan Chase that's going through an implementation on this. And this quarter, we had several wins across different segments that we sell to from banks, nonbanks and credit unions. And we had a significant win with loanDepot this past quarter which they, like many lenders, are trying to get the efficiencies that we -- that our platform will provide to them. So that's a little bit of a flavor in some of the segments of what we see under the covers. Richard Repetto : My follow-up question would be in the Exchange segment. And I don't know whether it's for Jeff or Ben but the energy complex, not just you, industry-wide continues at least to perplex a lot of us with the volume performance there. And again, it's not just you, it's industry. But Jeff or Ben, could you give us a little bit more insight into -- you're making up a good part of the volumes, growing financial futures and cash equities and options. But like the gas oil contract, I believe it's down 40% year-over-year and this idea of higher margin causing corporates and speculators to pull back. Could you give us some more color into the energy complex, specifically gas oil? Ben Jackson : Sure. Sure, Rich. It's Ben again. And you alluded to it in the way that you asked the question around the way that we manage this business is from looking at the overall portfolio and we have a wide lens on this. And we pride ourselves in having the deepest and most liquid futures markets to enable our customers to manage risk across the energy spectrum, also in the global rates environment. We manage our business as an overall portfolio and that's the nature of that all-weather aspect of our stock. In energy specifically which is where you were going, we manage even the energy segment as a portfolio. And we're proud to say that despite all these headwinds, our energy business itself, open interest is up when you look across the entire business, is up 6% since the end of last year. And this is in the backdrop of a confluence of all kinds of issues that the world is dealing with right now. You have this unfortunate war. You have on-and-off lockdowns in China. You have a push to move towards cleaner energy sources. You have underinvestment in energy infrastructure. You have major releases from the strategic petroleum reserve, all rearing their head at the same time. And we're proud that now more than ever, our clients are coming to us to manage their risk. And I'll touch on a couple of areas within energy. And you asked specifically about gas oil, so I'll touch on that as well. So broadly speaking, we positioned our business to help clients manage their transition towards a cleaner energy environment. That's why we have the most deep liquid markets around the globe in oil, natural gas, power, LNG and environmentals. In oil, we have seen some headwinds. You focused on gas oil and you're spot on. And gas oil has had some headwinds. Most of this is associated to the market needing clarity around how Russian oil deliveries into the contract would be handled because, historically, Russian oil did go into that contract. We work with governments and customers to come up with a market-based solution to this and also landed on a sanctions regime that we align to that at the end of this year, Russian oil can no longer be delivered into that contract. Once we did that and provided clarity to the market for that, we have started to see open interest rebuild in that contract in calendar year '23 and beyond. So that's a positive. It's going to take some time for that to play out but we're seeing that on the horizon. We believe that, that's going to turn the corner. Within oil itself, expanding further across what's going on in the portfolio, we've had some very positive developments. So our options contracts have done very, very well. Brent alone has seen options volume up 14% year-over-year. And part of the reason for that is that options contracts enable a trader to hedge a whole range of outcome. It enables them an efficient way to manage geopolitical risks. And there's also a little bit of a lower-margin requirement associated with these because if you're buying an option, your risk on that option is limited to the premium that you pay. So all of that's incorporated into the margin models. So we've seen a lot of success in our options markets. And we have new innovations; we continue to build our Murban contract that we launched. And we're continuing to hit records consistently with our Midland WTI Gulf Coast contract that we launched earlier this year. So we're having some good success and continue to build on that. The other area I'd touch on quickly would be natural gas. So our natural gas business, you have to again expand the lens and look at it from a global perspective. I mentioned U.S. gas is at a record and up 23% in volume. And globally, our natural gas business is up 16% and 6% in OI. And some of the inputs to that is our TTF business has seen some headwinds because Russia has historically supplied 40% of the gas to Continental Europe and the supply has effectively been cut off. But what's filling the void? U.S. LNG is filling that void for Europe. And that's fueling strength in our North American gas complex as commercial customers are trading our Henry and our basis markets significantly. And also a lot of those LNG cargoes that are going to Europe are hedged by our TTF contract, our Henry Hub contract, basis markets as well as our LNG markets. And the last thing I'd say on the gas markets is that we're innovating and working on market-based solutions with Europe as we understand the situation there. And we're -- we announced just recently, we're going to be launching some new contracts, new basis contracts in Italy, France and Germany in gas to trade alongside our existing Continental gas business and then in Northwest Europe and Southwest Europe LNG contracts that will trade alongside our JKM contract. And it's important that the feedback we're getting from our clients is that all of these contracts are likely to trade basis and relative to our TTF deep liquid price benchmark. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Ken Worthington : I'd like to spend a little time on the old life business and the European rate complex. We've seen inflation in Europe in the highest rates in more than a decade. So maybe first, bring us back, what was the peak of revenue generation for the European rate business back when rates were much higher? And then do you think the opportunity here is bigger or smaller today for that franchise, given the underlying market? And then CME launched Ether futures, I think, earlier in the week which I think seems like your turf. So can you talk about the potential for investment in the rates business and product development? Do you think this is sort of an attractive use of resources? And what are you thinking from here? Ben Jackson : Ken, it's Ben. I'll start here. The -- so when you look across our rates business, the way we look at it and we manage it, we manage it as a portfolio. We look at, in particular, the largest parts of our rate franchise are with our SONIA Gilts business as well as Euribor. And underneath the covers, when you look at what's been going on geopolitically and the overall environment, Continental Europe has actually done a pretty good job of signaling how they're going to handle this rates environment. And the market has responded very well to that. And that's what's led to just a very, very solid year in terms of Euribor volumes as well as open interest as that is up over 60% on a year-over-year basis. So that part of the business has done extraordinarily well. If you look at the U.K. specifically and Gilt and SONIA, there's 2 dynamics going on there. With SONIA specifically when you're comparing our performance with last year, you have to remember that last year, we had both short sterling and SONIA trading side by side. And this year -- and then those converged in December of last year. So this year, you have SONIA only. So there's a bit of an off comparison there as there was a significant amount of arbitrating going on between SONIA and short sterling as that converge into what's taking place. And now you have SONIA as a stand-alone. In the U.K., though, specifically, obviously, there's been political uncertainty there. You've had the change of Prime Ministers. You've got uncertain rate hike expectations. You had the mini budget that shocked a lot of people. You had a potential currency crisis all hitting at the same time. And that definitely weighed a little bit on SONIA and Gilt but we're already seeing signs that the market is stabilizing as the environment has stabilized there. So we feel very good about that overall rates portfolio that we have. It's definitely an area we're continuing to invest. We have our own SOFR contract that we've launched as well. And it's an area that we're going to continue to invest and we see opportunity. Ken Worthington : Okay. If you recall the size, is there a lot of opportunity to grow it versus what it was a decade ago? Or is that sort of the peak of what you think this can be? Warren Gardiner : So Ken, we'll go ahead and get you the exact number there but I think it's certainly approaching where it was years and I think the record would have been sort of '08, '09, that kind of a range in terms of the revenues. We certainly made some adjustments to RPCs in that complex, too. And there has been some pressure from FX this year. So I think we're approaching to where it was and we're around this level. But I do think that the world is a lot bigger and different than it was back then. And so I think as you think about the future, there's certainly room in what is effectively -- certainly on the Euribor, so the second largest reserve currency for that complex to grow well into the future regardless of what the prior level would have been. Operator : Our next question comes from Daniel Fannon of Jefferies. Daniel Fannon : So a couple of questions just on the Fixed Income and Data business. So the execution as well as the clearing has seen pretty strong activity this year. You mentioned higher rates. Is it -- you talked about just participation levels, customer growth, other areas or are these really more just kind of external factors kind of finally more as a tailwind? Lynn Martin : Dan, this is Lynn Martin. Thanks so much for the question. And absolutely, volatility has been a tailwind for the execution side of the business with record levels of CDS clearing so far in 2022. But what we're really -- we continue to be really excited about is the pickup of activity in our ICE bond platform where as a result of the continued Fed rate hikes, you've seen tremendous volatility in fixed income markets globally. And ICE bond is a beneficiary of some of that volatilities, particularly in our treasury, our muni, our corporate bond, our CD business where you've seen record levels of activity and volatility. In fact, activity measured on a volume perspective is almost 200% up in Q3 versus last Q3. A very important factor, though, is how we broaden out the participation in those platforms, particularly focused on institutional customers. And in Q3 alone, in our muni markets, you saw the levels of institutional participation grow by 192%. So that just continues on a trend that we've seen as a result of thinking about particularly the muni markets as an ecosystem and driving additional institutional participation across our platform. Daniel Fannon : Understood. And then on the data and analytics side, I think, Warren, you mentioned fourth quarter being kind of flattish with the third quarter in terms of growth and citing the, I think, lower bonds outstanding as a part -- as a factor. I guess could you remind us of the pricing model? I thought this was more of a subscription-based model, more recurring revenue associated with customers, not bonds outstanding. I guess provide a little more clarity or understanding in terms of how we think about the outstanding bond versus kind of customer growth and other things in terms of drivers of revenue. Lynn Martin : So Dan, this is Lynn again. I think I'll start off and then turn it over to Warren. Thanks for the follow-up question because I think what you're pointing to really illustrates how we build businesses to be all-weather businesses. We talked about the volatility in the markets being a significant tailwind for our execution side of the business but it's been a bit of a headwind for our fixed income data and analytics line, whereas Warren said in his prepared remarks, if you think about our index business, we've seen assets flow out of our higher capture indices, specifically equities, corporate bonds and munis. And assets flow into indices where we have a lower capture rate, specifically our treasury indices. In fact, if you look at the AUM benchmarked against our indices, it's actually at an all-time high. But the mix has significantly changed which impacts the revenue. And as Warren said, another headwind we're seeing that's affecting the fixed income data and analytics line is the new bond issuance which looked in fixed income this year. So that has impacted the growth rate of our legacy PRD business which has continued to grow albeit at a much slower rate. That said, volatility, again, has been a tailwind for the other part of our data services, particularly our other data services line where you see various factors increasing to what we believe is outsized growth in that line, including 22% increase in demand for capacity in our ICE Global Network as volatility continues to require customers to have reliable, resilient connectivity and higher bandwidth connectivity, double-digit growth in our consolidated feeds business, double-digit growth in our data analytics business which provides transparency to opaque asset classes and outsized growth in our desktop platform, specifically our chat platforms as ways that customers interact with our market continue to modernize. Warren Gardiner : And Dan, I'll just add to that, just to give you a little bit more color on the consumption of price. There is a subset of customers that do take or consume, I should say, based on the number of securities that are priced in the fund holdings that they have. It typically will be custodians and participants such as that. So there -- a lot of them honestly holding most, if not all, of the bond market, if you will. And so as the bond market in size fluctuates and this isn't necessarily related to refinancing which will be sort of canceled and replaced. It's more around new issuance and the growth of the overall bond markets whether it's corporates or munis or structured products as that fluctuates and it tends to be sort of lower single-digit growth over the years, that will help or to some extent hurt the growth in that component of our subscription business. But again, it's a part of the -- it's only a portion of the overall TRD business and the overall data business at the end of the day that, that applies to. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt of KBW. Kyle Voigt : Just wondering if you could comment a bit more on the health of your customers in the Mortgage Tech segment. You mentioned earlier in the call that there were some customers that didn't renew mostly to shuttering or consolidating. But we're really in the beginning phases of what could be a long and challenging volume environment. So I guess the question is, if the current mortgage environment remains extremely challenging over the next year, do you still believe you can grow the recurring revenues year-on-year in that segment and offset client attrition? Or should we expect some slowdown on that part of the business as well? Ben Jackson : Thanks, Kyle. This is Ben. And we do feel confident in our ability to grow the business over the long-term horizon of that 8% to 10%. And I think this past quarter is a perfect example to point out. You had the market down year-over-year close to 60%. And sequentially, it was down north of 25%. So a very tough environment for clients. And yet, as we approach them about shifting more of their -- the economic model that we have with them more towards subscription, even if it costs us some transaction revenue, they're willing to do that. And that's why we were able to get 2/3 of the customers to renew. And in this environment, low single-digit customers didn't renew. So I think that's a very good sign and a testament to the resiliency of the business but also the mission-critical nature of the technology that we provide. So from that standpoint, I see it all positive. The other thing that if you go back to the slide that Jeff referred to in his comments and you see what's happening with some of the churn and new lenders that are starting up, as some of these personnel are impacted, they're starting up new lending shops. And we're seeing growth in terms of new lenders this year. It's the population from that MERS graph that Jeff showed is higher than it was last year. So that is a testament that there's new startups coming up on the scene. As these folks start up, they want to adopt automation in the most efficient way to set up their businesses and we're well positioned to win that business albeit it's a competitive environment and we compete with others for that. But we have wins in that environment. So we expect some of that churn to continue. But where there's customers that potentially go out of business, there's also startups that happen on the back side of it. Jeff Sprecher : And this is Jeff. And let me just -- in the past earnings presentations, we've shown you the demographic trends that are going on in the United States. And yes, there are higher interest rates. Yes, there are supply chain issues for homebuilders, uncertainty for homebuilders but there is an unbelievably large demographic of people in this country that are starting new households, having children, getting married, moving on with their lives. And that demographic trend, one way or another, has to be satisfied with a place to live. And so I think what you're really seeing on a macro basis is us building solutions to deal in part with that population. Kyle Voigt : Understood. And in terms of follow-up, I just wanted to follow up on Dan's prior question just regarding the fixed income ASV growth decelerating to 4% in the quarter versus 5.5% last quarter. I appreciate the additional color on the index business and the headwinds that's facing. But just in terms of quantifying that, was that really the entirety of that kind of deceleration that we saw from 5.5% to 4%? Or were some of the other aspects that you mentioned also playing a role into that when we look sequentially? Warren Gardiner : Sure. Kyle, it's Warren. So there are a couple of things there. I mean, certainly, the macro headwinds we talked about on the AUM side and some of the pricing business but also don't forget Euronext is part of that as well. But if you adjust for those, yes, I mean, look, ASP adjusted for those was around 5%. It was closer to 5% for the quarter. So we feel pretty good about that business, given what's going on within fixed income markets at the moment. And again, don't lose -- and Lynn mentioned this but don't lose sight of the overall segment results, where the segment was up 14% year-over-year from a revenue perspective. We're up 12% year-to-date in that business. Operating margins in the quarter or operating income in the quarter, I should say, was up about 30%. And margins grew by 6 points. So overall, we're very happy with the performance of that segment and a lot of the factors that are weighing on what we're seeing on the pricing side, on the index side or what's benefiting for us on the trading side. So those results this year are some of the best we've had ever and so we're pleased with the results of the business overall. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Kramm of UBS. Alex Kramm : I want to come back to Richard's question on the energy performance. Ben, in your answer, it almost sounded like you blamed Russia-Ukraine situation almost entirely for what you're seeing, the underperformance there. So that almost sounds a little bit structural. So I just wanted to make sure there are other factors that you could maybe isolate or even point to some green shoots. I don't know. Is it margins having to come down? Is it volatility maybe coming to more normal levels? Or what would you think needs to happen for maybe that business to, in its current form, perform a little bit better unless it really is structural and something has changed? And then quickly, there's more talk of price caps in Europe as well. So just wondering how you view those in terms of impacting your business? Because generally speaking, somebody interfering in market forces is usually not good for volume. So just maybe those two additional areas in energy. Ben Jackson : Thank you, Alex. Yes, I think what you're seeing -- and I'll give a little more color on some of the things underneath this. But what you're seeing is that a lot of these regimes have not been put in place. So you've got -- and are put -- being put in place, for example, gas oil earlier. It's at the end of this year that those oil deliveries cannot happen. So you have some traders with comp month coming up right now and end of the year that just won't touch those contracts until this gets through. And that's why I also highlighted in the earlier question that we're starting to see open interest build '23 and beyond in the gas oil contract as an example. In natural gas, I think the things that I look at and that are encouraging to me is that when you look at our TTF business and you look at October of last year versus October of the month that just passed, the number of active market participants that we have in TTF is exactly the same. We haven't lost any market participants that are trading TTF. So that, to me, is a sign of longer-term strength in the business as the situation clears. We've also, at the same time, grown our data subscriptions in TTF double digits in that same period of time. So there's more eyeballs and more people paying attention to it. So from a longer-term perspective, we feel good about the positioning of these contracts. As I had mentioned, we're launching new contracts with those new basis gas locations in Italy, Germany and France as well as the Northwest Europe and Southwest Europe LNG contracts. Feedback from traders are all going to price relative to TTF. So we feel good long term about that as well. On price caps that you also mentioned, I mean, look, we understand the severity of the situation in Europe. We are in very active dialogue at the table with government and with regulators and commercial customers to forge a market-based solution to these issues. And we know our role is to create deep liquid futures markets to provide important price signals on supply and demand dynamics as they're changing to make sure that people have the best pricing tools to hedge and manage their risk. Through our discussions and you can also see through media that's happened over the last couple of weeks, there is acknowledgment broadly of the issues with price caps and a general agreement that they don't want to disrupt the price discovery. And a lot of the issues that are being highlighted in these articles and that we've been expressing and commercial market participants have been expressing as well as several governments are that an artificial price limit on the commodity makes it very difficult to accurately hedge commodity price risk. Second would be if you're -- that if you put price caps in these markets, you could end up having the unintended result of taking volume and liquidity from transparent lit markets and moving it to the OTC markets, reversing more than a decade of progress that's been made here. If you create an artificial price in the settlement, in the clearinghouses, it makes it difficult for clearinghouses to manage the accurate risk that we're exposed to if it's dislocated from what the real market price is of that position. And it can create an artificial price that may overencourage consumption which is not what people are looking for right now. And obviously, these markets are global and supplies can go elsewhere. So that's why we're at the table. We're encouraged that recent rhetoric as they understand a lot of those issues and risks. And we're in the middle of putting forth market-based solutions which is why we're proactively launching all these contracts in December and are continuing in the middle of the dialogues to help the situation settle. Alex Kramm : I appreciate the incremental color here. Just one quick one for Warren then. It seems like your revenue is benefiting from higher rates directly more. So I was just hoping if you can remind me what the magnitude is, I think, in the OTC and other line on the exchange side. And then on the CDS business, you got net interest income. So maybe some underlying data you can give us in terms of the balances and the rates you're getting, what rates you're mostly sensitive to in Europe and then in the U.S. because, obviously, the rate picture is fairly dynamic these days. So I just wanted to make sure we understand how to model that better. Warren Gardiner : Sure. So in terms of OTC and other, about -- if you look at the second quarter, about half of the increase would have been related to member interest. And I'll just say too, within -- not only just the CDS business but also within our clearinghouses, we're not trying to be a bank. The service we're providing is clearing and risk management and that's the value that we're providing to those customers. And so we're actually -- we're trying to lower collateral levels where we can. Ben mentioned pushing people or I should say, leading people towards the benefits of options. We're working on trying to expand the different types of collateral that we accepted such as with some of the emissions allowances. And so we are still -- we are starting to see a little bit of normalization in some of the collateral levels as we sit here in October but it's just difficult to predict where that's going to go. It certainly is a part of -- or a significant part of OTC and other but there are a lot of other elements to that line item as well. So it's been the driver of some of the growth we've seen but it's certainly not the vast majority, if you will, of the total line at the end of the day. And then the same would hold for the CDS business where, certainly, it's helped as we -- as collateral levels have built there. But we're also, as you would imagine, seeing really strong trading volumes across that business -- or clearing volumes across that businesses. As certainly as the headlines around recessions and interest rates continue to build, the demand for credit risk and credit protection is increasing alongside that. So that's been really a bigger driver of things over a longer period of time than anything else. And don't forget, too, that in the third quarter, that's a roll quarter as is the first quarter. So we benefit a little bit from that as well relative to maybe the second and fourth quarter in that business. The other area I would just point out to is if you go below the line, we're actually benefiting a little bit from the cash on hand in our -- the interest that we're earning on the bonds that we have -- or sorry, on the cash we have on hand. So there's a benefit of that from an interest rate perspective as well that's flowing through the income statement, in addition, of course, to the benefit we get on the future side from higher rates within Euribor and some of the U.K. interest rate businesses as well. So there's a number of different things across the platform, of course, as rates are rising that we're benefiting that may be offsetting some of the areas that tend to not do as well during higher rate environments. Operator : Due to time constraints, that was our last question today. I'll now hand back over to Jeff Sprecher for any closing remarks. Jeff Sprecher : Well, thank you, Charlie and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. I would really like to again thank my colleagues for delivering yet another record quarter and thank our customers for putting your faith in us during these very uncertain times. We appreciate your business. We look forward to updating you all again as we continue to execute on the opportunity set that we were able to talk to you about today. And with that, I hope you have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

[Operator Instructions] I'll now hand over to your host, Katia Gonzalez, Investor Relations and Senior Analyst. Katia, please go ahead. Katia Gonzalez : Good morning. ICE's fourth quarter 2022 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2022 Form 10-K, and other filings with the SEC. In addition, as we announced last year, ICE has agreed to acquire Black Knight. The transaction is pending customary regulatory approval and we expect to close in the first half of this year. In connection with the proposed transaction, ICE has filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 to register the shares of ICE common stock to be issued in connection with the transaction. The registration statement includes a proxy statement of Black Knight that also constitutes a prospectus of ICE. Please see the Form S-4 filing for additional information regarding the transaction. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP terms in the earnings materials. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, references to revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of our earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain items. With us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chair and CEO; Warren Gardiner, Chief Financial Officer; Ben Jackson, President; and Lynn Martin, President of the NYSE. I'll now turn the call over to Warren. Warren Gardiner : Thanks, Katya. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide four with some of the key highlights from our fourth quarter results. Net revenues of $1.8 billion were driven by transaction revenues of $828 million and recurring revenues of $940 million, up 4% year-over-year. For the full year revenues totaled $7.3 billion, also up 4% versus last year. Fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $740 million, and we're within our guidance range, including approximately $5 million of additional severance. This strong performance helped to drive fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share $1.25 and full year adjusted EPS of $5.30, an increase of 5% versus 2021.  2022, free cash flow totaled a record $2.9 billion, which enabled us to return nearly $1.5 billion to shareholders while also continuing to make strategic investments across our business. In addition, we have received Board authorization to increase our quarterly dividend by 11% to $0.42 per share, beginning in the first quarter of 2023, extending our 10-year track record of double digit dividend growth. Now let's move to Slide five, where I\u2019ll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment.  Fourth quarter net revenues totaled $982 million. Transaction revenues of over $600 million were driven in part by 11% growth in agricultural commodities, and 13% growth in our equity derivatives business. Importantly, open interest trends remain strong across our futures and options in January, including 14% growth in global natural gas and 24% growth in LIBOR. Recurring revenues, which include our exchange data services, and our NYSC listings business increased by 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Customer growth, particularly within our energy exchange data was partially offset by slower growth in our listings business. While industry wide capital markets activity was relatively muted. It's worth noting that despite a slower year for IPOs, across the globe, we had a record year for listing transfers was 34, including more operating companies in the last three years combined. For the full year exchange segment, revenues increased by 8%, including a 33% increase in our interest rate business, a 20% increase in equity derivatives, and an 8% increase in our global natural gas revenues. Turning now to Slide six, I'll discuss our fixed income and data services segment. Fourth quarter revenues totaled a record $537 million up 13% versus a year ago. Transaction revenues increased by 89%, including 182% growth in ICE bonds, and 66% growth in our CDS Clearing business. Similar to last quarter, this strong growth was driven by market volatility, higher interest rates and our continued efforts to build institutional connectivity to our bond platforms. Recurring revenue growth of 3% was driven by demand for additional capacity on ICE global network, as well as strong growth across our desktop, feeds and analytics offerings. We're beginning to see a return on the investments we've made in both enhance content and functionality. This performance is a key driver of our other data and network services business which increased by 8% in the fourth quarter, and 10%, excluding the impact of the Euronext migration. Somewhat offsetting with slower growth in our end-of-day pricing business, we're experiencing a slower sales cycle and pressure from asset base revenues in our index business, which declined double digits year-over-year, as investors shifted out of higher fee risk assets, such as equities and corporate bonds, and communities and treasury ETFs. For the full year, total segment, revenues totaled a record $2.1 billion up 13%. While adjusted operating margins expanded by 500 basis points, as anticipated recurring revenue grew 4% for the year and it was up 5% after adjusting for Euronext. Let's go next to Slide seven, where I\u2019ll discuss our Mortgage Technology Segment. Fourth quarter Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $249 million. Recurring revenues which accounted for two-thirds of segment revenues totaled $164 million and grew 10% year-over-year. These strong recurring revenues continue to drive out performance versus an industry that experienced a nearly 60% decline in origination volumes. Importantly, they've now less revenues increased by over 30% year-over-year. For the full year, Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $1.1 billion, including a 16% increase in our recurring revenues, and a 24% increase in our data analytics revenues. And while industry volumes were actually below those seen three years ago in 2020 -- in 2019, pro forma 2022 Mortgage Technology revenues are higher by nearly 50%, representing a CAGR of roughly 14%. I'll conclude my remarks on Slide eight with some additional guidance. Recurring revenues in 2023 were once again be led by our Mortgage Technology segment, where we are expecting mid to high single digit growth, a testament to the continued adoption of automation across the mortgage workflow.  In our fixed income and data services segment, we expect recurring revenue growth, excluding headwinds of approximately $15 million related to FX and the Euronext data center migration to once again be in the mid-single digits.  And lastly, in our Exchange segment, we expect recurring revenue growth excluding a $20 million headwind from the cessation of LIBOR to be in the low single digits. As continued growth in our energy exchange data services is offset by fewer IPOs and the tapering of 2021 initial listing fees.  Moving to expenses, we expect 2023 adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $3.04 to $3.09 billion. Consistent with prior years, we will reward our employees for their contributions to our strong results, and therefore expect cash compensation expense to increase by approximately $20 to $40 million.  Strategic investments in technology operations and revenue related initiatives are expected to increase by $40 to $50 million, driven by higher licensees as well as investments across all three of our segments.  In addition, we expect roughly $45 million to $55 million of incremental noncash expense, including $25 million of D&A related to the rebuild of Ellie Mae CapEx. And lastly, we expect an FX benefit to our adjusted expenses by approximately $5 million to $15 million when compared to 2022. In summary, we delivered another record year of revenues, operating income, free cash flow and earnings per share. Across our business, we made strategic investments in future growth and as we enter 2023, we are well positioned to meet the evolving needs of our customers, once again, deliver profitable growth and create value for our shareholders. I'll be happy to take questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll hand it over to Ben. Benjamin Jackson : Thank you, Warren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 9. 2022 was a year marked by rising inflation, rising interest rates and continued geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty. Amidst this dynamic macroeconomic environment, we once again grew revenues, operating income and earnings per share, record results that are a testament to the resiliency and durability of our strategically diversified business model. In our financial futures markets, rising inflation and central bank activity across the globe presented an interest rate environment that has not been seen in generation, helping us drive 20% volume growth in our interest rate complex and 15% growth in our equity derivatives business.  Across our global energy markets, the events unfolding across North America, Europe, Russia and Asia have triggered a reshaping of the global energy supply chain, creating new risks and uncertainties for market participants to navigate.  In our global natural gas markets, an evolving energy supply chain in Europe has led to increased demand for global liquefied natural gas, or LNG, and has helped us drive a 17% increase in global gas volumes in 2022. This includes 24% growth in our North American gas business, which has benefited not only from increased commercial engagement with our Henry Hub contract but also our North American basis markets. These trends have continued into January with global natural gas open interest up 14% year-over-year, including 21% growth in North America. Although our European carbon markets experienced headwinds in 2022 due to the aforementioned factors, the secular trend towards cleaner energy continues and is a growth trend we are uniquely positioned to capture, as evidenced by the record year in our North American environmental markets with volumes up 5% year-over-year in 2022.  As we look out over the longer term, corporates and market participants remain committed to environmental policy to reduce carbon emissions. This is an evolution that we've long envisioned and is one of the largest providers of environmental products, including renewable fuel contracts, carbon allowances, nature-based solutions, renewable energy certificates as well as the wealth of climate data and related into season analytics. We are excited about the many future growth opportunities that lie ahead. Moving to our Fixed Income and Data Services business. Our comprehensive platform continues to generate compounding revenue growth and delivered another year of record revenues in 2022. This strong growth was underpinned by both recurring and transaction revenue growth, again a testament to the strategic diversification of our business and our ability to deliver growth through an array of macroeconomic environments.  Rising market uncertainty and interest rates are driving an increase in demand for credit protection, and we have seen this lead to increasing trading activity in our bonds business. These factors, coupled with our continued efforts to build institutional connectivity to our bonds platforms, continued to record full year revenues -- to record revenues in our ICE Bonds business in 2022 up nearly 100% year-over-year. Turning now to our Mortgage business, increased workflow efficiency through continued electronification is a secular trend we believe will continue through a variety of mortgage origination environments. Our ability to capture this secular trend is evidenced by the strength and resiliency of our recurring revenues, which increased 16% in 2022. This continued strength is a result of executing against our strategy of leveraging our mission-critical technology and data expertise to accelerate this analog to digital conversion. As mortgage origination volumes have normalized, customer conversations have increasingly centered on efficiencies and automation. In the fourth quarter, we had our strongest quarter of last year in terms of sales to new customers of our loan origination system with wins across each major segment we service.  In addition, there continues to be increased interest in our data and analytics products, which increased 31% in the quarter and 24% for the full year in 2022. Through our AIQ solution and analyzer tools customers can save thousands of dollars per loan by leveraging our data and analytics tools to drive automation in the loan manufacturing process. We are pleased that the value of our offerings continues to resonate with lenders, and we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity to accelerate the analog to digital conversion.  I'll now turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Sprecher : Thank you, Ben. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Please turn to Slide 10. I want to begin by touching on our pending acquisition of Black Knight. As communicated, when making the announcement, we continued to believe that this transaction will close during the first half of this year. Our respect for the Federal Trade Commission's work on this matter, and as we cooperate with them to gain regulatory approval, we do not intend to comment further on the transaction. But importantly, we remain excited about the efficiencies that the combined entities will bring to the end consumer and to other stakeholders across the mortgage ecosystem. In that vein, and shifting to what was yet another successful year, 2022 marked our 17th consecutive year of record revenues, record operating income and record adjusted earnings per share. This track record of growth reflects on the quality of our strategy and, more importantly, on the execution of that strategy. We've intentionally diversified across asset classes and geographies, so that we're not tied to any one cyclical trend or macroeconomic environment. We've deliberately positioned the company to have a mix of transaction and compounding subscription revenues to provide upside exposure while hedging our downside risk. We've placed the company at the center of some of the largest markets undergoing an analog to digital conversion. The combination of these factors is what has made ICE an all-weather name and a business model that provides upside to volatility with less downside risk and, importantly, a business model that generates growth on top of growth. For example, in 2022, inflationary concerns and market speculation of central bank activity benefited our European and U.K. interest rate business, driving a 33% increase in revenues for the full year. These conditions also contributed to record full year revenues in our credit default swap clearing business, up 61% year-over-year, as rate volatility drove increased demand for risk management and credit protection. Across our mortgage business, even against this backdrop of rising interest rates, our business outperformed the broader market driven by strong recurring revenue growth, up 16% for the full year. Again, this is a reflection of the all-weather nature of our business model.  As we look to 2023 and beyond, we're positioned to capitalize on the secular and cyclical trends occurring across asset classes, and we remain focused on executing on the many growth opportunities that are in front of us, extending our track record of growth. I'd like to conclude by thanking our customers for their business and for their trust in 2022, and I want to thank my colleagues for their contributions to the best year in our company's history. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to our operator, Alex, who will conduct a question-and-answer session until 9 :30 Eastern Time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from Rich Repetto from Piper Sandler. Rich, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Richard Repetto : Yes, good morning, Jeff and Ben and Warren. I wanted to ask about energy and more specifically natural gas. Ben, you made a lot of comments about how strong the U.S. natural gas markets are. You can see it in the volumes. But one issue it seems coming up is in the European natural gas and the TTF contract want to put in the right perspective, it's only 15%, I think, of the natural gas volumes but this whole deal with price caps that have been implemented and what you're going to do about it. And I guess it ties into the bigger question of politics and regulation impacting the markets, Jeff, as well. But anyway, the question on natural gas and sort of this broader intervention of government or regulation. Benjamin Jackson : Rich, it's Ben. Great question. To start, you got to remember that gas used to be a commodity that was highly dependent upon wellheads and pipeline infrastructure. So supply chains used to be a natural gas, very attached to that type of infrastructure. And whenever there was a disruption to that type of infrastructure, it's very difficult to adjust to rebalance those supply chains is all very localized, not really a global energy product. Fast forward to today, natural gas is very much a global energy product. It's a global energy supply chain, especially with the advent of LNG. And today, LNG can be freely flowed pretty much anywhere around the world as long as there's regasification capacity to do this. We saw this many years ago, and we've been investing in a global natural gas business that provides benchmarks around the world, has LNG contracts around the world that continue to expand as well as LNG freight contracts. So if you look at last year in GTF specifically, you had the unfortunate event where Russia invades Ukraine, and we saw significant energy supply disruptions where Russia was a significant supplier of oil, gas oil and natural gas, in particular, to Europe. And those supplies were effectively cut off. It created a very difficult trading situation for many of our market participants. At the same time, we saw market data subscriptions continue to grow in that part of our business. We saw more and more high balls and more of our community was growing around this. Fast forward to 2023, those supply chains have readjusted because natural gas is now a global commodity. And you have a significant amount of U.S. LNG and Middle Eastern LNG flowing now to Europe, backfilling a lot of those lost Russian gas supplies. So this market clarity has helped bolster confidence in trading products like ETF, and you see it already year open interest is up 10%. Volumes are up roughly 4% off of a comp of last year, which was actually pretty strong for TTF at the beginning of the year. Now for gas specifically, you have all kinds of macroeconomic environments that people need to manage risk around right now, but it's important to point out these are tradable events. Things like regasification coming online in Europe, so there's more and more gas that can come into Europe more efficiently. You've got storage -- gas storage facilities across Europe that have been filled.  Weather so far hasn't been an issue this year in Europe. European demand is down. So you have a potential for a recession that's looming. Chinese demand last year in '22 was down with the economy, for all intents and purposes, closed, and now it's reopening. And for the first time last year in '22, it's the first time that natural gas and LNG physical supplies into China is likely to reduce since the early '80s. So now with the reopening, what is that going to mean?  And then you also have a move towards a cleaner environment, where natural gas being the cleanest of the fossil fuels continues to be in high demand. These are all macroeconomic environments that can be tradable. They are all things that people can forecast around. And we feel great about the position that we have with the business that we've built to help traders manage around that, and we continue to invest in new contracts in the LNG space, few basis contracts in Europe around that. Now on price caps, I have mentioned on the last call, I went through a whole bunch of different issues that price caps can introduce around the difficulty you can create for people to manage and trade risk. ESMA has even come out recently with a comment that the unfortunate consequences of a price cap can be making it difficult for people to manage risk. Now for the aforementioned factors that I mentioned, the price of TTF has come way down. And the price cap right now is set at north of 3 times where TTF is trading. But that said, these can create issues for our market participants. So what we've decided to do is we're launching a new TTF contract in the U.K., it's a look-alike to the one we have in the Netherlands now, to provide customers a choice.  It's important to point out that, that TTF contract is going to trade alongside another TTF contract that we already have in the U.K. called the TTF frontline. It's a U.S. dollar-denominated contract that's oftentimes used as a basis contract to trade LNG cargoes because those are also U.S. dollar-denominated. And all those contracts cleared in the U.K. already. So we already have a community of traders that are attached to us in the U.K. for that. And it's a hedge. If they decide to use it, great. At a minimum for us, it provides us a free market price discovery mechanism to manage risk in our clearing house and to settle contracts. Operator : Our next question comes from Daniel Fannon of Jefferies. Daniel, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Daniel Fannon : Thanks, good morning. I wanted to follow up on the fixed income and data outlook as you think about '23, the mid-single-digit growth. Can you talk about the inputs that you're assuming for 2023, whether that's pricing and where the growth is? And I know you've cited some headwinds in '22. And maybe elaborate a little bit on that and maybe how you're thinking about changes within those headwinds going forward. Warren Gardiner : Dan, it's Warren. Good question. So there's not really much change in terms of our expectations and our targets as we head into next year. A couple of years ago, we outlined the growth algorithm for the data business, and that's been pretty consistent for the last couple of years. So there'll be a little bit of price we talked about in prior years, that being around a third of the growth. There will certainly be contributions from new customers, contributions from current customers purchasing more. And so I think it's a pretty similar algorithm if you're thinking about this year versus past years. I think when we're thinking about 2023 specifically, look, the macro, those factors are a little bit difficult to predict. I mean, AUM fees, particularly the last two quarters, those have been something that have weighed on us a little bit. I don't know exactly where those are going to go next year. It does feel like certainly in areas like fixed income, we could see some stabilization. And frankly, fixed income could very quickly become a very attractive asset class. So look, we're having some really good conversations with customers. We are a data superstore, if you will, We're indices, we're end-of-day pricing. We have analytics. We have got desktops. We've got fees. It's a really diverse business. And so it's an opportunity for us to have conversations with customers in this kind of environment than we are to maybe find ways to save but spend more with us.  And that's something I think you've heard us talk about the last couple of years. So there's nothing really different about our target. But again, we're certainly cognizant that it's a somewhat challenging environment for a lot of our customers at the moment. Lynn Martin : Hi, Dan, this is Lynn. I'm just going to jump in with a bit more color on what Warren said. I think this segment, in particular, really illustrates the all-weather nature of the ICE name. And the ability for this segment to grow 13% in spite of some of the challenges Warren has highlighted really underpin that.  If you look at the execution side of the business, volatility has certainly been a tailwind, but importantly, new products and new customer acquisition has also been driver of our growth, new products in the CDS clearing side of the business, including our CDS options. In terms of ICE bonds, we've actually been able to grow our institutional market share. Institutional business in the muni asset class, in particular, is up 205% in Q4 alone, 175% for the full year. And we've been able to gain in muni about 650 basis points of share in 2022, really driven by the work we've done with the institutions to plug into their workflows. Now obviously, some of the macro forces have impacted the fixed income and data and analytics line, as Warren highlighted, slightly slower sales cycle in our pricing business. AUM trends driving out of our higher capture products into our lower fee capture products. But I would be remiss if I didn't talk about the outsized performance of our other data services line, where we haven't seen a slowdown in the sales cycle. And this was really fueled by demand for capacity, which was up 18% in the quarter, double-digit growth in our desktop and derivatives analytics businesses as well as strong growth in our fees business. So I think when you take a step back and look at the segment overall, we couldn't be more optimistic about the ability for that segment, in particular, to grow, compounding in a variety of macroeconomic positions because of the all-weather nature of the name. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Ken, your line is now open. Ken Worthington : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe to follow up on Rich's question, but with a focus on oil I wanted to dig a bit deeper into some of the changes that are being made there. You mentioned on the last call that you were taking Russian molecules out of the benchmark and highlighted the reconstitution maybe adding to activity levels in Brent. Given that Russian oil continues to flow pretty actively in Europe, is the reconstitution helping or hurting like you thought? And then secondly, I think Midland WTI has been added to Brent. To what extent do you see this inclusion making Brent an even more relevant benchmark? And as we think about Brent as a competing product to WTI, might this shift further drive share to ICE and Brent in oil? Benjamin Jackson : Thanks, Ken. It's Ben. Great question. And yes, you're right. You had the same dynamic that I highlighted before on TTF with oil as well as downstream products like gas oil as well, to some degree, getting cut off from Europe. But we have seen a similar dynamic that I mentioned in the natural gas markets where you have U.S., Norway and Middle Eastern oil now flowing in to help address some of that supply that has been lost based on Russia effectively cutting that off. So what we have seen -- since we announced in the second half of last year, that Russian molecules were no longer deliverable into the gas oil contract as an example. One of the things that we saw develop underneath the covers is that open interest in gas oil from October 1 to the end of last year grew 100% in deliveries starting in January of this year. And then since the end of the year, it's grown another 14%. So all that is showing the underlying health of the return and bolstering of market confidence coming back to products like gas oil, once that specificity was created. That said, you have a whole -- so we're seeing market confidence come back. Brent's up as well since the beginning of the year. So we feel good about that contract. Our Brent options contract has also done very well. But all of these supply chain changes around the world is why we've been making the investments we've had in a whole bunch of different areas around oil over the last few years. Two years ago, we've announced and launched ICE Futures Abu Dhabi and the Murban contract. And the interesting development we've seen with Murban is that Murban historically priced Middle Eastern barrels going out to Asia. And now, as I mentioned, Middle Eastern oil is also backfilling, to some degree, some of the supply cuts happen from Russia on oil supplies. And we're seeing Murban now being used to price Middle Eastern barrels that are going into Europe. That's one of the things that's feeding north of a 50% growth in Murban year-to-date this year. So we're off to a great start there. The Midland WTI contract that you highlighted, we launched that contract a year ago. And that contract is off to a great start. Tons of physical traders in it, prices, Midland TI that goes to Houston and hits the water and a lot of that oil is going over to Europe, it's a perfect product for people to use to hedge cargoes that are going into Europe. And again, with that supply chain dynamic of U.S. oil, backfilling a lot of the Russian oil that was cut off, we were very well positioned there. And then at the midpoint of this year, that Midland contract is perfectly positioned to be traded in parallel to Brent with those Midland TI barrels coming into the Brent index. So we feel very well positioned with all of the investments we've been making in and around oil in anticipation of potential supply chain changes, and we think we're well positioned there for growth. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Allen of Citi. Chris, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Chris Allen : Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about Mortgage Tech recurring revenue outlook. You noted some bright spots in your comments just in terms of some of the sales you're seeing, the conversations you're having with customers, but we're seeing this continue to somewhat -- to decline in terms of the pace of growth, albeit still at healthy levels.  And coming into the mortgage slowdown, you kind of noted that the mortgage industry was have been very busy during the single upturn. Now that the downturn occurred, there was an opportunity set to improve efficiency there that it's almost going to an acceleration of recurring revenue growth. So maybe you could kind of frame out the decline in the Mortgage Tech revenue growth outlook. What's being driven just in terms of the overall dampening of the industry right now? What's kind of the opportunity set in terms of further customer penetration going forward? Benjamin Jackson : Thank you. Thank you for the question. Great question. And I always highlight, and it's important to point out, that we're looking to build this business and build some fundamental building blocks that enable this business to grow 8% to 10% over a long period of time. And you're right. So we've made a very concerted effort. One of the big cornerstones of that strategy is a concerted move to move transaction revenue more and more towards subscription to make the business model much more predictable underneath that.  And we feel good about the fact that we've been able to grow subscription revenue in the fourth quarter of 9% given the backdrop of an environment where volumes were down 60% and sequentially, they were down 20% approximately. So in that environment, we're still able to grow it. And I'll be the first to highlight, the mortgage industry didn't expect the downturn to happen as fast as it did or as rapidly and as deep as it did. So we have seen with some of our clients that are coming up for renewal. We've seen some clients consolidate, gone through M&A on true business. And so we've seen some cancellations due to those factors. That has created some headwinds into the business. But offsetting that, we've had a number of different items that have enabled us to grow and give us confidence in the ability to grow the business going forward. The first thing is that of the renewals we had last quarter, north of 60% of them renewed at higher subscription rates than they did at the beginning of the quarter due to our strategy to intentionally shift more transaction revenue towards subscription and also success in cross-selling more clients -- more products to our clients. The second is we had a very strong quarter and encompassed sales. In fact, the strongest quarter that we had of all of 2022 was in the fourth quarter. And we've seen that in a couple of different areas. So we saw it across all the different segments that we cover. So I think of banks, non-bank originators, brokers, credit unions. But we also saw a lot of new start-up companies coming to us.  So with the unfortunate backdrop of people getting downsized in this mortgage environment, several of those impacted employees are becoming entrepreneurs, starting up their own mortgage shops. And we're very well positioned to win that business, albeit it may be at a lower subscription fee to start, but we have the ability to grow with them as this mortgage market will snap back at some point in time. We also see, just looking out into the future that there's a lot of large banks, large -- a lot of large home lending banks that have legacy infrastructure in-house systems that they've been running for years that are looking to upgrade and replace that.  We think our funnel reflects that, and we feel really good about the prospects that those companies are looking to continue to make investments here in 2023, which will lead to growth factors for us going into the future. So that's a little bit of color of what happened in the fourth quarter as well as why we feel good about our prospects going forward. Jeff Sprecher : And I think if you step back -- this is Jeff. If you step back, what we're talking to the industry about is a fundamental shift in the way they assemble and manufacture mortgages to take costs out of the system, to move the industry to more of a SaaS model, subscription-based model instead of a model where every single mortgage is put together a la carte with services and the cost of a first-time homebuyers mortgage versus the cost of a $1 million mortgage are essentially the same in the current system. And it just makes sense to us that if we can give the industry a more predictable way of operating their businesses, they can be more responsive to their customers and allocate costs proportionately across their business, which is the way business is done in most other digital markets or markets that have moved from analog to digital. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Kramm of UBS. Alex, your line is now open. Alex Kramm : Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to ask about pricing holistically across the business. When you look at the data services space, some of your peers, maybe some of them in the desktop space that you're not in, but we're seeing price increases because of inflation. Your primary peer in the futures trading side also seems to have been taken a bigger price increase than usual this year. So when you put this all together and you look at your business, it seems like you're leaving some money on the table and you're a little bit afraid to kind of like turn that lever a little bit more. So just wondering if you're thinking, is it all evolving given the higher inflationary environment that's obviously driving your cost higher as well? Warren Gardiner : Alex, this is Warren. It's a good question. We've certainly seen some of the peers out there and what they've done on the pricing front. It's always been our philosophy that, when we're going to increase price, it will come with value added to the particular product that we're increasing that price on. And that hasn't changed, and that's not going to change this year. I think from our perspective, the better long-term strategy is to operate that way, and that's what we're going to be doing this year. And we mentioned a little bit earlier on the Fixed Income and Data Services side, there really wasn't much difference in terms of how we're approaching that this year. We do have a small amount of contracts, it's pretty immaterial at the end of the day, that are benchmarked to inflation. But I don't think you'd really notice that at the end of the day, depending on how much that will fluctuate. So on that front, I would say it's pretty consistent. On the futures side, we're always looking at that as an option. But again, it's something we haven't really pulled lever on up until this point, and there certainly have been instances in the past where we've done it. But something we are thinking about and always thinking about, frankly. So I wouldn't necessary that's much of a change. But yes, that's something that's out there and certainly on what some of the others have been doing. Jeff Sprecher : And this is Jeff. I would just mention that we spend a tremendous amount of time focused on our own costs and the cost of delivering these products and continue to make prudent investments but underneath allocate to personnel and resources.  We've been -- you may notice, of all the major exchange groups, we've been the most cautious, if you will, of moving business to the cloud because those are areas where we've seen the largest cost increases and the most unpredictable rises in cost. So we have continued to be conservative in delivering our products the way our customers want to see them but trying to do it in a way that is very, very cost efficient. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Alex, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Alex Blostein : Hi, everybody good morning. Thanks for the question. I just want to go back to some of the energy dynamics in the space. And I was hoping you guys could talk about the environmentals for a bit. It\u2019s great to see the TTF complex kind of coming back to life here in January. What would it take to get, I guess, the environmental products going again? And kind of what are some of the dynamics in that market for '23? Benjamin Jackson : Thanks, Alex. It's Ben. And we feel really, really great about the position we have in the environmental marketplace. As you know, we were here very, very early. Almost 13 years ago is when we acquired the Climate Exchange, and that was really the foundational piece to it. And we've been building and investing around this the entire time since we've owned that and now have the most global complete suite of solutions there that are helping our clients price carbon, offset their carbon risks, trade renewable energy credits, et cetera. And one of the other strengths that we have to our environmental business is that there's a symbiotic relationship that we see with energy. A lot of people that are producing energy or consuming energy need to care about the price of carbon. So we see a symbiotic relationship there. For our business, if you look under the covers of what was going on last year in 2022, we did see some headwinds, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, on the European Union allowance markets. And a lot of that was associated to time, capital and attention being paid towards the energy markets. That said, we continue to see market data subscriptions, in particular, environmentals, are growing nicely over the years. So we continue to have people added into our community between our market data, between our ICE instant messaging platform and chat platform. We continue to grow visibility and interest into our markets there. I'd also point out that the European Union late last year reaffirmed the trading scheme and continue to signal that things like free allowance thresholds, so the amount of carbon that you're allowed to emit before you have to buy allowance, all those are going to start coming down, which means that more carbon is going to need to be priced and more sectors of the economy are going to be captured. So from a long term looking out over the horizon perspective, that's a tailwind of growth. We launched our U.K. allowance platform. That was up nicely last year, up 16% and North America, as I had mentioned, had a record last year of almost 3.7 million lots traded with a record number of market participants in there. Our regi contracts, which is regional greenhouse gas emissions California carbon allowances, renewable fuels all had a great year. We continue to invest here by launching new contracts. We launched tech wind solar contracts last year, and we also launched a few tranches of nature-based offsets. One of the things that we announced at the end of last year that may have flown under the radar for people is when you look at the offset market in the carbon and environmental credit markets, those markets tend to be called voluntary, and they are very nascent. Those are markets that no one has really been able to effectively develop yet, and they're all in very, very early stages. One of the key problems we think that there is from our experience in developing other markets is that there's a fundamental -- fundamentally very difficult for somebody to understand what is the offset that one would want to trade. What is the underlying reference data associated to it? What are the components that make up that offset or that environmental credit? What's the quality of that credit? Basic supply information like how much was issued when it was originally issued, how much has been retired and how much still exists. So we launched, at the end of the year, a reference data service where our community of over 100,000 instant messaging and chat clients that are traders that are utilizing that all day long, they're energy traders, they're environmental market traders can instantly look up any offset, any environmental credit, be able to get all of the reference data associated to that credit; how much was issued when it was issued;, how much has been expired, how much is still available to trade, this is all basic fundamental supply data that people need to be able to price -- fundamentally price the contract. So we pulled all that together, so you can gather all that information on a near real-time basis. We pulled it together from a variety of different sources to make what was hours worth of work, if not days, can be done instantaneously. And obviously, with that information, it can help with price formation and eventually interaction with our community to help identify people that would want to trade.  So we feel great about our positioning there. We're investing there, and that's just one significant example of a nascent market that we think we have some foundational elements that we're so excited about. Operator : Our next question comes from Simon Clinch of Atlantic Equities. Simon, your line is now open. Simon Clinch : Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to cycle back to the mortgage business. And specifically looking at the transaction revenues, I was just wanting -- as you're increasingly looking to shift your revenue streams towards the recurring revenue line over time, should we look at that as do start to rebound?  And then secondly, is there -- should we assume that the sort of level of outgrowth versus -- of the transaction revenues versus those mortgage industry volumes should narrow and to zero because we're effectively shifting all of your business to recurring revenue streams? Just trying to understand the dynamic that's going on between the recurring revenues and transaction revenues right at this point. Benjamin Jackson : Sure. Simon, it's Ben. So there's a couple of different pieces to that question that I'll cover. So on transaction revenue, we have said we are willing to give up some transaction revenue that we have today. So take, for example, a \"success\" fee. When a loan is codified, there's a transactional fee associated to that, that where -- if we lower that to some degree for our clients but shift more of that towards recurring revenue and more predictable revenue to us, we'll do that. So there is some short-term impact to our transaction -- to existing transaction revenues. At the same time, we have a whole suite of other services that we're cross-selling to our stable of 3,000 Encompass customers, for example, around the world, some of which are recurring, some of which are transaction that, as those continue to mature because they're very early stages but are showing some great signs of success, our ability to cross-sell those, things like our data and analytics offerings, which we -- were transactions that we've tilted much more towards subscription. But then we also have services in our closing line item that we're continuing to invest in and we're continuing to add on that will be incremental transaction revenues. So there's a mix underneath the covers there. But we believe that having a more predictable business model for the longer term will enable us to continue to grow the business at 8% to 10% a year for a long period of time. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. Craig, your line is now open. Craig Siegenthaler : Good morning, everyone. I wanted to come back to Ben's commentary that 4Q is the strongest Mortgage Tech sales quarter since last year. What products drove the increase in 4Q versus the prior quarters? And also given several announcements of exits and downsizes in the residential mortgage world, and I'm thinking Wells Fargo is probably the biggest, which products are you seeing under the most pressure on the sales front in 4Q? Benjamin Jackson : Thanks for the question, Craig. So a lot of what we saw in terms of sales strength, so I'll just -- I'll talk about 2022 first, then I'll go in the fourth quarter. So for 2022 as a whole, our AIQ, that -- the automation service that's lowering the cost of manufacturing a loan to our clients was very strong throughout the entire year and each quarter. We had a good quarter in selling new clients onto that platform. Again, that's hopefully lowering their cost of manufacturing along a lot of the comments that Jeff made before. And hopefully, those cost savings get passed on to the end consumer. In the fourth quarter, it was an interesting dynamic. It was actually our -- the core Encompass product that drove that sales strength that we had in the fourth quarter. So what we're seeing is that, while you do have customers that are consolidating, you have some M&A, you have some downsizing that's happening with that client mix. The two things that we see in parallel are that, one, a lot of the banks credit unions, non-bank originators, they're using this time to invest in infrastructure.  So if they have in-house systems, for example, which is often what we're unseating, they're looking to invest in their infrastructure to be ready for when this market snaps back. Looking at our funnel going forward, we know that a lot of the big banks are looking at that, that infrastructure that they have and looking at making investments to position them well when the market snaps back. And then the other thing that we're seeing is, as I mentioned, as employees are impacted by these downsizings. We're seeing a lot of them start new shops. And as entrepreneurs, they're starting new shops, and we're well positioned to win that business as well.  So we're very well positioned across the entire spectrum. And people are taking -- we see people taking advantage of the opportunity right now where there is a strain in the system to invest and be ready for when the market comes back. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Brian, your line is now open. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks, good morning folks. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to turn back to fixed income trading. It's been on such a strong growth trajectory. And when you described good traction in the muni business and data, maybe if you can talk a little bit more about the mix of revenues within that business. I know the market share gains have been really good. Is it mostly munis? And just thinking about the sustainability of this, munis has been growing more than doubling on a year-over-year basis, reaching a $100 million annual revenue business in the second quarter and if it can continues to grow like sequentially, it will be a $200 million annual business within a couple of quarters. So just trying to get a sense of the drivers behind that and if you think this momentum can continue? Lynn Martin : Yes. Thanks for the question. As I mentioned, volatility certainly did help out this business, but a lot of the share gains we've achieved in the institutional side of the business has really been what's driving the growth. 26% in Q4 of our muni activity came from institutional accounts. So that's up from 13% in 2020 when we started to acquire all of these different platforms. So we've really been able to increased institutional footprint. We do see opportunities also in treasuries and CDs. Those two asset classes within the execution segment have outperformed a lot of that volatility-driven. But the toughest thing to do is to get the plumbing into the institutional accounts. And I think the deliberate decisions we took a couple of years ago to be workflow-agnostic, to work with a variety of providers to plumb our platforms into a variety of workflow solutions have really beared fruit in 2022. So when volatility came into the market, it wasn't just about your traditional retail trader that was executing the munis and corporates. It's now about the institutional trader that sees us as a diversified platform across multiple asset classes in fixed income. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Michael, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Michael Cyprys : Great. Thanks. I wanted to circle back on Mortgage Technology. With the recurring revenues up about 16% mid-teens in 2022, I was hoping you might be able to help unpack what portion of that recurring revenue growth was from unit growth, from existing -- excuse me, unit growth from new customers versus wallet share gains from existing customers where you're expanding the services they are offering to them versus what portion of the growth is coming from current versions from transactional to the recurring revenue side. And then when you look ahead to '23 with your mid- to high single-digit growth there on the recurring revenue sides and Mortgage Tech, how do you see that mix evolving in your outlook into '23? Thank you. Benjamin Jackson : Thank you, Michael. It's Ben. And it's a mix on it. You hit on some of the elements in the way you asked the question. So our view has been that when you have this significant stable of customers, the 3,000 lenders that are on our platform and utilizing our services, there's a tremendous opportunity to cross-sell. And one of the things that's really driving that recurring revenue growth is the success we have in continuing to sell our AIQ platform into that customer base. We have a long way to go in being able to penetrate those 3,000 lenders and be able to provide them the efficiency that they need now more than ever. So we feel good about our ability to cross-sell and how we've executed on it to date since we acquired, the former Ellie Mae business and looking forward ahead into the future. The other thing is new sales. So we continue to have great success adding new customers. Customers can come on and utilize that AIQ, offering those analysis to other third-party providers. So we continue to have success there. And we also continue to add new customers on to Encompass. And I just answered a question on that. A couple of questions that go here. So we continue to have great success in the Encompass for all the different segments that we sell through. Whether it's a start-up company, whether it's an established non-bank originator, whether it's a bank or a credit union, we're a broker across the entire spectrum, we believe the investments we've made in our platform is very well positioned to meet those clients' needs. And as we see a lot of the major home lenders in the U.S. looking to replace in-house legacy infrastructure, we think we're also very well placed to win that business as well. So those are the key drivers -- as well as it's having very relatively low attrition. We are a core platform for operating these businesses. So unless they're going out of business or there's M&A that's happening, we're not losing business. Operator : Thank you. We have no further questions for today. So I will hand back to Jeff Sprecher for any further remarks. Jeff Sprecher : Well, thank you, Alex. Thank you all for joining us here this morning. We are continuing to innovate for our customers and build an all-weather business model and delivery growth. And so with that, I hope you'll have a great day and appreciate your being with us. Operator : Thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

[Operator Instructions] I will now hand over to your host, Katia Gonzalez, Manager of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Katia Gonzalez : Good morning. ICE's first quarter 2023 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2023 Form 10-Q, and other filings with the SEC. In addition, as we announced last year, ICE has agreed to acquire Black Knight. The transaction is still pending customary regulatory approval and we expect to close in the second half of this year. In connection with the proposed transaction, ICE has filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 to register the shares of ICE common stock to be issued in connection with the transaction. The registration statement includes a proxy statement of Black Knight that also constitutes a prospectus of ICE. Please see the Form S-4 filing for additional information regarding the transaction. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP terms in the earnings materials. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, references to revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of our earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain items. While Lynn is not able to join today\u2019s call, as she is participating in our large IPO being conducted at the NYSE, with us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chair and CEO; Warren Gardiner, Chief Financial Officer and Ben Jackson, President.  I'll now turn the call over to Warren. Warren Gardiner : Thanks, Katya. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today.  I'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our first quarter results. Adjusted earnings per share $1.41 was driven by net revenues of $1.9 billion, including record exchange revenues and record fixed income and data service revenues, which increased 12% year-over-year.  First quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $740 million, $5 million below the low end of our guidance range, driven by timing of professional services fees and technology spend. This strong performance helped to drive an adjusted operating margin of 51% and record adjusted operating income of $1.2 billion. Looking to the second quarter, we expect adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $763 million to $773 million with a sequential increase driven by the full quarter impact of 2023 merit increases, as well as strategic investments in technology and growth initiatives across our business.  Now let\u2019s move to Slide 5, where I\u2019ll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. First quarter net revenues totaled a record $1.1 billion. Transaction revenues was $739 million were driven in part by 15% growth in agricultural commodities, and a 16% increase in our global natural gas business.  Importantly, open interest trends remains strong across Futures and Options as of the end of April, including 6% growth in global energy, and 17% growth and Ag. It's worth noting that on May 1, we implemented select price increases within our energy business capturing a portion of the substantial value we have brought to the asset class over the last decade through both continuous product innovation and technology enhancements.  Depending on the mix of volumes, we would expect the benefits of our energy RPC, beginning with the second quarter. Recurring revenues, which include our Exchange Data Services and our NYSE Listings business increased by 5% year-over-year including 8% growth in Exchange Data Services, which was in part driven by double-digit growth and a number of customers consuming or Global Energy and Environmental Data.  This was partially offset by slower growth in our Listings business, where industry-wide capital markets activity continued to be relatively muted. It's worth noting that despite the current environment, the IPO backlog continues to grow and another eight companies elected to transfer the NYSE through April closing on a record year for transfers in 2022. Turning now to Slide 6, I'll discuss our fixed income and Data Services segment. First quarter revenues totaled a record $563 million, up 12% versus a year ago. Transaction revenues increased by 54% including a 106% growth in ICE bonds and 42% percent growth our CDS Clearing system.  Similar to last quarter, this strong growth was driven by market volatility, higher interest rates and our continued efforts to build institutional connectivity to our bond platform. Excluding the impacts of the Euronext migration, recurring revenues grew by 4% driven by additional capacity on the ICE Global Network, as well as strong growth across our Analytics and Desktop offerings with strong demand from energy and environmental-focused customers. This performance is a key driver of our other Data and Network Services business, which increased by 8% in the first quarter and 10% excluding the impact of Euronext. Similar to last quarter, we experienced an extended sales cycle within our End of Day Pricing business, as well as pressure in asset-based revenues and our Index business, which declined year-over-year as investors shifted out of higher fee risk assets in 2022 such as equities, and corporate bonds and into munis and Tributary ETFs.  Let's go to Slide 7 where I\u2019ll discuss our Mortgage Technology segment. First quarter Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $236 million. Recurring revenues, which accounted for nearly 70% of segment revenues totaled $165 million and grew 6% year-over-year. These strong recurring revenues continued to help drive outperformance versus an industry that experienced a nearly 60% percent decline in origination volumes. While nearly two-thirds of our Encompass customers that came up for renewal during the quarter did so at higher minimum helping to drive year-over-year and sequential growth in recurring revenues, it was somewhat offset by increased pressure from customers electing to renew at lower levels.  Importantly, the vast majority of these customers remain on the Encompass and ICE Mortgage Technology platform. While we expect to continue to have outperform the industry, if current cyclical conditions persists we would expect recurring revenues to be towards the lower end of our mid-to-high-single-digit guidance range for the year.  These same cyclical conditions and cost pressures are also increasingly attracting customers that have not traditionally been on the Encompass platform. This is best evidence by our first signing of a top five global banks during the quarter electing to replace their legacy in-house loan origination technology. While not expected to impact 2023, recurring revenues this helped to drive the best quarter for new sales of Encompass in the product\u2019s history and is a clear testament to the increasing need for workflow efficiencies and another example of the synergy opportunities that exists for ICE across the mortgage industry.  In summary, we delivered another quarter of revenue, operating income, and free cash flow growth. We continue to make strategic investments across our business, and future profitable growth opportunities and we are well positioned to meet the evolving needs of our customers, and create value for our shareholders. I'll be happy to take questions during Q&A, but for I\u2019ll now hand it over to Ben. Benjamin Jackson : Thank you Warren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 8. Amidst a very Dynamic macro environment, including a shock to the banking sector, our customers continue to rely on our leading technology, mission-critical data and transparent and accessible markets to navigate these uncertain conditions.  This contributed to our all-time highest single volume day of 14.5 million contracts across our markets on March 13. Along with this, we also achieved record options volumes across our commodities in the quarter, up 21% year-over-year. As seen historically, options contracts are an efficient and valuable tool in highly uncertain market conditions.  In our interest rate markets, Central Bank activity, and banking concerns led to increased hedging activity, driving 18% percent volume growth in the first quarter. This growth was underpinned by a 25% volume increase in our Euribor contracts including record Futures volumes. We also had record volumes in our SONIA contract, up 12% year-over-year.  This strong performance is a testament to the strength of our multi-currency multi-benchmark offering across interest rates. Across our Global Energy markets, how energy is produced and consumed has evolved rapidly. Importantly, we have continuously invested alongside this evolution building a global platform that today is one of the most diverse and liquid energy marketplaces in the world.  This platform has established benchmarks in emerging markets across every source of energy. And with record energy options in the first quarter, up 21%, year-over-year and energy open interest up 6% through the end of April, we are pleased that our customers continue to turn to our deep liquid market to manage their risk.  In our oil markets, we've invested in building a global platform that positions us well to provide the critical price transparency, across the energy spectrum that will enable participants to navigate the clean energy transition. Today, the resilience and liquidity of ICE\u2019s Brent benchmark has surpassed other oil benchmarks in both volume and open interest and at the same time, reached an all-time high in Options market share.  This demonstrates that the market depends on the Brent benchmark\u2019s ability to reflect global fundamentals. Importantly, Brent stands as the cornerstone of a franchise spanning key price benchmarks across Gasoil, WTI, Platts Dubai, and more recently Murban.  Together, these benchmarks form the foundation of a cohesive web of more than 700 related oil products such as vocational, product, and refining spreads. In the last few years, we've also invested in biofuels and renewable oil products, such as RINs, RVOs, biofuels, and low carbon fuel standard products and while small today, we see positive signs that these will become meaningful contributors in the future. Importantly, driven by the breadth of our commercial customer base we have become the natural home for liquidity in these products with open interest in our oil complex of 5% year-over-year through the end of April.  In our natural gas markets, we've adopted a similar playbook, building a global platform that spans benchmarks across North America, Europe and Asia, a thoughtful approach that positions us well to benefit from both the near-term volatility and the long-term secular growth trends occurring across these markets. This has also helped us drive a 10% increase in global gas volumes in the first quarter.  This includes a 14% growth in our North American Gas business, which not only benefited from continued commercial engagement in our Henry Hub contract, but also our North American bases markets.  In our environmental markets, we\u2019ve recognized the importance of carbon price transparency over 10 years ago, acquiring the Climate Exchange 2010. As we look out over the longer-term, corporates and market participants remain committed to Environmental Policy to reduce carbon emissions as illustrated by a record number of market participants in the quarter, up 7% year-over-year.  In summary, as the clean energy transition continues to introduce new complexities, uncertainties, and volatilities to energy markets, our global environmental markets, alongside our global oil, gas, and power markets provide the critical price transparency that will enable participants to navigate this evolution. Moving to our Fixed Income and Data Services business, our comprehensive platform continued to generate compounding revenue growth and delivered another quarter of record revenues up 12% year-over-year. This strong growth was underpinned by both recurring and transaction revenues, a testament to the strategic diversification of our business model and our ability to deliver growth through an array of macroeconomic environments.  Rising market uncertainty and interest rates, as well, as continued efforts to build institutional connectivity to our bonds platforms provided significant tailwinds for ICE bonds, which was up over 100% year-over-year. We're also beginning to see return on the investments we've made in both enhanced content and functionality across our other Data, and Network Services business.  This part of our business increased 8% in the first quarter, driven by demand for additional capacity on the ICE Global Network, our private cloud, as well as strong growth across our analytics and desktop offerings. As we move forward, there is a significant opportunity to continue to expand and evolve the products and services within our Fixed Income and Data Services business.  From the digitization of fixed income workflow to the innovations we bring to connectivity and market data, ICE is well positioned for long-term success and growth.  Turning now to our Mortgage business, in the first quarter, we once again outperformed the broader industry, driven by strong recurring revenues of 6% year-over-year. This continued outperformance is a result of executing against our strategy of leveraging our technology and data expertise to accelerate the analog to digital conversion happening in the industry.  Part of that strategy is intentionally shifting more business to recurring revenue, particularly within our Origination Technology and Data and Analytics business. While still in the early days of this transition, we continue to see strong clients adoption.  Importantly, as customers increasingly seek efficiencies across a very manual process, our leading Origination Technology known as Encompass provides valuable digital solutions that can reduce both the time and cost required to originate a loan.  We are pleased to see the value of our offering continues to resonate with lenders and this is highlighted by the fact that we had record new sales in our Encompass offering in the first quarter, and the sales success included for the first time a Top 5, global bank electing to replace their legacy in-house loan origination technology for their retail business. This is a testament to the trust and strong relationships ICE has established with our customers since our founding. Additionally, the recent exit of a largest correspondent lender in the country that was not on Encompass, presents opportunities for lenders that are on Encompass. This focus on automation and efficiencies also contributed to a 10% growth in our Data and Analytics business.  Through our AIQ offering, customers can leverage our analytics such as our credit and income analyzers, as well as leverage or automated document recognition and data extraction technology to reduce the manual stare and compare work that exists across the mortgage workflow today. This automation could save lenders thousands of dollars per loan by reducing manufacturing time and complexity. The continued growth in our recurring revenues is a testament to the demand we're seeing for these digital solutions. As these new customers come on to our network, we benefit from new subscription revenues and have the opportunity to expand the customer relationship over time as they adopt additional solutions. Just as we've seen in our other markets, this flywheel effect is what we believe will drive compounding growth in our recurring revenues and gives us confidence that we can grow a business that today is only a fraction of the $10 billion addressable market that is in the early days of an analog to digital conversion.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Sprecher : Thank you, Ben. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Please turn to Slide 9. I'll begin by touching on our pending acquisition of Black Knight. Since the initial announcement in May of 2022, ICE has remained unwavering in its belief and commitment to the combination of our companies. In March, we announced revised terms of our merger agreement to acquire Black Knight at $75 per share or a market value of $11.7 billion from our previous terms of $85 per share. Black Knight\u2019s shareholders approved this revised deal last week.  In addition, and although ICE strongly believes that acquiring Black Knight is entirely pro-competitive. We also announced an agreement to sell Black Knight\u2019s Empower loan origination system, plus certain related businesses to Constellation Software Inc. We did this in order to remove a perceived horizontal competition concern. The divestiture transaction is subject to the closing of ICE\u2019s acquisition of Black Knight and other customary closing conditions. ICE and Black Knight intend to defend the pro-consumer merits of our revised merger in Federal District Court. A scheduling hearing is scheduled to take place on May 12th to establish the timetable for this process, after which time we'll have a better ability to discuss the calendar for deal completion.  We're unable to answer any questions on this call relating to our transaction with Black Knight. We remain fully confident in our position and we look forward to presenting it in court. Importantly, we're very excited about the value and the efficiencies that the combined entities will bring to the end-consumer, as well as other stakeholders across the mortgage ecosystem.  Shifting to our strong results, the first quarter was highlighted by record adjusted operating results that include continued compounding recurring revenue growth across all three business segments, along with record revenues and our Exchanged and Fixed Income and Data Services businesses.  Remarkably, we did this against last year's exceptional first quarter with its unprecedented volatility driven largely by the onset of conflict in the Ukraine. These strong first quarter results are a testament to the value of our data and technology and the strength of our strategic business model. Over the past 20 years, ICE has continually evolved to meet the needs of our customers, resulting in value for our stockholders. Our evolution has been intentional, diversifying across asset classes and geographies and increasing our mix of recurring revenues.  The compounding growth of our subscription-based services combined with our diverse transaction- based businesses means that our growth is not tied to one economic cycle to one geography or to one asset class. This provides upside exposure while hedging our downside risk.  Looking to the balance of the year and beyond, we\u2019re excited about the many growth opportunities that are in front of us and we remain focused on delivering innovative solutions for our customers, while driving compounding growth for our stockholders.  Before I end my prepared remarks, I'd like to say thank you to our customers for their continued business and for their trust. And I'd like to say thank you to my colleagues at ICE for their contributions to another good quarter.  And with that, I'll turn the call now, back to our moderator Laura and will conduct a question-and-answer session until 9 :30 Eastern Time. Operator : [Operator Instructions]  Our first question comes from Rich Repetto from Piper Sandler. Rich, please go ahead. Richard Repetto : Yeah, good morning, Jeff and Ben and Warren. Congrats on the second best revenue quarter and EPS quarter in the company's history. So, I'd like to go back to the origin, being energy and I know Ben, you spent a lot of time on it. But still the quarter-over-quarter, or at least excuse me - the comparisons compared to the second quarter of last year improved dramatically for you, they are down 20% last second quarter versus the first quarter.  So, I guess, the question is, then and you just put in a price increase is what could derail the strong - looking more out at the just energy market overall we know what you're doing with Options in the open interest, but what's the outlook for volumes and what could derail this positive setup you got to deliver for the remainder of the year here, but it looks like a positive set up? Benjamin Jackson : Thanks, Rich, and hey, this is this Ben. Thanks for the good questions and the commentary there. The - simply said, the setup couldn't be better for the balance of this year. When we look at the health of our overall markets, I mean we've as you alluded to in your comments, we\u2019ve built this business with a long lens and if you towards what customers risk management needs are across the entire energy spectrum including helping to help our clients navigate to a cleaner energy world and through our environmental markets that we've invested heavily in.  And the setup just couldn't be better. If you look at right now, we're at or near an average daily volume market share high against any of our peers in crude and in oil or at or near open interest, market share highs in North American gas and global gas.  We\u2019re at or near revenue share highs in energy. We had record energy options volume in Q1 posted an all-time high for Brent versus WTI Options share versus our peers. We had record active market participation in our environmental markets and our TTF gas, as well as, we're at or near record to data subscribers in several markets.  And this positioning also is underpinning our ability as Warren said in his prepared remarks around the growth in our desktops business in Energy and Environmentals, we have this flywheel effect, but we're also seeing some nice growth in our Fixed Income and Data Services business in this area. So, why are we seeing all this?  Last year, you had the war in Ukraine. This unfortunate war that created all these supply shocks across European energy markets create a very difficult trading environment. We continued to look at the health of the market by active market participation and market data subscribers and we didn't see that shrink. In fact, we saw it grow.  And look at where we are today with US for example, US oil, and LNG backfilling a lot of the supplies that have been cut off from Russia. We are starting to see the market normalize. And that has driven since the end of the year. TTFs open interest growth of 40%, since year-end. Gas oils come roaring back. Now that it's clear that Russian oil is not going to be in gas oil deliveries as of the beginning of this year.  That's up over 30% since year-end. Energy options are up close to 20%. Our Brent benchmarks are doing very well, up 18% since the end of this year. And now you have WTI Midland-grade oil coming into Brent this summer, mostly priced by our Midland WTI American Gulf Coast contracts. We\u2019re well, positioned there.  And then the other market that we saw that had some headwinds last year was our EUA markets or European Union Allowance markets, because there were so much time attention and capital being put towards energy. We saw that come back strong with average daily volume up 18%, Q1 versus Q4. And there's long-term secular growth drivers for that EUA business where there's roughly 4 Gigatons of carbon emissions that are emitted in Europe.  Today, about one-and-a-half Gigatons of those carbon emissions are priced by compliance markets based on policies that are in place. In over the next few years, as a new program, called Fit for 55 comes into place, another one and a half Gigatons will be priced as roads, buildings and maritime sectors of the economies start to get pulled into this, which is all a long-term secular growth driver for that.  So we feel very, very well set up for the balance of the year and beyond, Richard Repetto : Okay, thank you very much, Ben and team. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Kyle, please go ahead. Kyle Voigt : Hi, good morning. You noted the top five global bank win replaced their in-house solutions with Encompass. I guess, is there any way to frame the revenue upside or the potential revenue upside from that contract? And then in terms of, kind of Tier one size banks, do you think getting this signing could kind of open the door to other opportunities of this size? And if you come out on the pipeline from kind of that that client segment of the larger banks? Thank you. Benjamin Jackson : Thanks Kyle. This is Ben. So if you remember last quarter, I had highlighted that the fourth quarter of \u201822 was the strongest sales in terms of new sales to new Encompass customers of all of 2022. And then we followed it up with Q1 of this year, being the strongest new sales in Encompass to new customers of all time. So we feel great about really the hypothesis that we had when we, few years ago, bought the Ellie Mae business, that you had a lot of banks that had aging in-house infrastructure that they were trying to support. And we felt that that replacement cycle was going to be coming up as that's the main competitor that we have in the Encompass marketplaces is in-house legacy infrastructure. And as we've seen that funnel develop, I alluded to it on the first - on our last call that we saw a strong funnel of these types of banks that we\u2019re talking to and engage with and talking about the benefits that Encompass can provide them, anyway and lo and behold we brought on board one of the biggest global banks onto the platform here in the first quarter.  So, we - these customers, I need to point out are large. They are complex businesses. It's going to take time to implement them. So, in terms of timing and when we will see revenue contribution, it's more likely going to start to come in, in 2024. But, again, we believe that based on the hypothesis that we had clients are going to be replacing this in-house infrastructure, as well as the relationships that ICE has established, the long-term relationships that we've established since our founding, being a trusted technology and infrastructure provider for financial institutions like this, and we\u2019re very well positioned to win this business as other banks look and making the same decisions. Kyle Voigt : Thanks Ben. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm from UBS. Alex, please go ahead. Alex Kramm : Yeah, hey guys. Good morning. Just going back to energy for a second and being more specific here. You mentioned the pricing increase, maybe I've missed it. Obviously, we can look at your disclosures in terms of the fee schedule. But there's a lot of mix here. So, maybe on a like-for-like basis, maybe look at 1Q volume mix, like how much would the pricing changes actually impact RPC or revenue? Warren Gardiner : Hey Alex. It\u2019s Warren. So, good question. So, I'd expect a few pennies of impact all of equal. What we did there was we touched a handful of products within energy. And so, when I say, a few pennies I am talking about the Energy RPC overall of course. And so we touched a handful of contracts within the broader energy complex.  We have - this is something we haven't done in some cases, decades it's into in other cases ever. As you know, our philosophy is really to take the approach of where we created value for our customers and then over time go capture some of that value. And so, we felt like this was a good opportunity given the backdrop to do that in some of these contracts. And that\u2019s what you're seeing there.  And so, hey look, what we've done that in the past, we're always looking to do that and we'll continue to look for those opportunities not only within Futures, but really across the business and taking that that same philosophy as we go forward here, so. So, hopefully that's helpful in terms of thinking about the impacts. Alex Kramm : You can't put it in percentage terms, can you? Or could you? Warren Gardiner : Well, I would just say, look, the energy RPC was at $1.60 in the quarter I would say a few pennies on top of that, that should help you in terms of thinking about the impact. Alex Kramm : I was looking for exact math, but good enough. Thank you. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Dan, please go ahead. Daniel Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. So, I guess, another question for you, Warren. You talked about strategic investments and that's part of the pickup sequentially. And I was hoping you could just frame where those investments are going in this year, kind of projects and/or products. And then, if the environment isn't as constructive as we think about the back half of the year, is there some flex to maybe remove or reduce spend across the expense base? Warren Gardiner : Yes, that\u2019s good question. So, in terms of some of the investments we\u2019re making, we're making those across technology. We're also making some select hires in certain areas, particularly areas within some of our data products, new data sets, ESG indices. We\u2019re expanding some of the opportunities we have within the connectivity business.  So it's fairly broad based in terms of those Investments we\u2019re making. And that's all part of the plan, if you will, or the budget when we enter the year. As we talked a little bit, or I talked a little bit earlier about in my prepared remarks about how so we did have some expenses pushed into the second quarter. So we're, as I'm noting now, we're going to continue to make those investments and we're on plan to do that. Look, over time, of course, and the goal every year is to grow both in the near and the long-term. And to do that, we've got to make investments in the business, particularly, if we're going to grow into the future, and that's what we're going to, and what we're doing here. And that's what you should expect us to continue to do. And that's frankly, that's the benefit of that we have with the diversified model.  We had not only across asset classes but also the mix of subscription it tends to be a little more resilient. And then and then as well as on the diversified transaction front. So, that's what we'll do and I think look, as we're thinking about how things trend through the balance of the year, look, we're a company that's run pretty efficiently. We had operating margins of 61% in the quarter.  That's been a philosophy that we've had to operate that way and look to run the business efficiently, both in good times and bad times or tough times. And so, I don't think you should expect us to really be changing how are we thinking about that. And so we're going to make those investments. And to the extent we need it to pull back, we will think about that.  But I think it would have to be more of a structural change in the in some of the asset classes that we\u2019re in and then anything is difficult, because again we want to drive long-term growth. And there's no reason for us sitting here today that to do that, because we're not seeing that at the moment. Daniel Fannon : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Bond from Rosenblatt Securities. Andrew, please go ahead. Andrew Bond : Hey, good morning. Just wanted to ask this is there any change to your thoughts in ICE\u2019s strategy into digital assets base in the recent months? Are there attritional changes to come more active and given the impact of the current banking crisis in other countries, where ICE already has worked with regulators stepping up their efforts to really become crypto hub for the US bills are also behind. And additionally, do you think US Government and regulators are making a mistake by not being more proactive in providing thoughtful regulatory clarity in place? Thanks. Jeff Sprecher : This is Jeff. So, we sort of have our point in two places with respect to digital assets. First of all, we created Back and then spun it out as its own public company. And while I can't speak for Back management, the philosophy that we put into the company at the time of the spin was to be highly regulated.  In other words, to get 50 state money transmitter licenses and set up a custodial banking practice under the New York Banking Regulations. And so, from the onset, I would say, we had the philosophy that anything we did around digital assets should be, should comport to existing regulation. The - we own and operate the world's largest exchange, The New York Stock Exchange, 350 billion transactions a day.  And we have the infrastructure to list digital assets. It is different than a lot of the entrepreneurs in the digital space in that a requirement of the US Securities Exchange is that its members have to be licensed broker/dealers. So there is no such thing as NYSE Direct. It's not that we couldn't build NYSE Direct. It's not that we don't have relationships with end-users.  But the law says that that end-users need to come through broker/dealers who provide KYC and AML oversight to the market. And so, so far that model hasn't been one that the market has been interested in. But our ability to list a digital asset is actually quite easy. It's obviously a token and registering on a public blockchain is actually relatively simple given the complexity of the infrastructure that we're used to operate in.  So, we'll see how this unfolds. It does appear that the SEC and other regulators would prefer to use that traditional infrastructure for tokens in the United States and a lot of their compliance activities seem to be focused on moving the existing market towards our model and the historical model. And to the extent that there's an appetite for us it would be easy for us to list digital assets. And we obviously have the domain knowledge here having built back on how to operate in a public blockchain environment. Andrew Bond : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Michael, please go ahead. Michael Cyprys : Great. Thank you. Good morning. So, just a question on mortgage. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about where you guys are along the journey of digitizing the mortgage process from e-Closings to e-Notes. It seems, you have a lot of capabilities already in place. Maybe it's just about driving engagement from here. So, if you could talk about what's left? What are some of the hurdles that you're facing? What are some of the steps that you're taking to overcome those hurdles and to accelerate the push the digitize the marketplace? Thank you. Benjamin Jackson : Thanks Michael. It's Ben. The short answer to the question is, we have done a really good job of integrating the businesses that we've acquired over the last few years from MERS to the Simplifile business to then the Ellie Mae business really bringing together from the start of the origination process all the way through to the electronic closing of the loan.  We have integrated those into a cohesive platform for our clients. And it's you alluded to, we've stood up an electronic closing room for our clients to digitize the close. We have e-Notes now as part of the Encompass document set native into our loan origination system. So we're really set up well to be able to cross-sell the solution set into all of our clients.  That's the thing I think most important for people to really when they're thinking about the mortgage headwinds, and the current conditions in the marketplace is and I think Warren mentioned this in his comments in his prepared remarks that we're not losing clients. And of the 6,000 lenders that are out there we're providing some services to just about every one of them.  3,000 of those lenders are on our Encompass platform. So we're very, very well positioned to now cross-sell these solutions to our clients. So, right now, what we've been what we've been really focused on and that we've completed that that integration is executing on the sales success that we've had. We've talked about the strong funnel that we've had and bringing new clients into the Encompass ecosystem.  I think the other thing to point out as you see, some of the some of the noise in our results is for people to fully appreciate that when we have renewals that are coming through our process, just like we did last quarter, more than 60% of the clients that renewed at higher subscription fees then where they, where they started at the beginning of that quarter.  What we're trading off for that is a per-close loan fee. We're lowering that to some degree, which is transaction revenue. So, of the clients that did not renew at higher subscription and perhaps went down in subscription, there the trade-off is consistently that we're raising the per-close loan fee on those clients, which means that as the market rebounds and returns, we have an opportunity to participate in the upside there.  So it's important that people see that one, we're not losing customers. Two, we are very well positioned to cross-sell the entire digital solution suite that you alluded to in the way that you asked the question. And we're set up very well with that balance between transaction and subscription revenue where if clients are in tough times and they need to reduce their subscriptions, we can participate in the upside in transaction revenue. Jeff Sprecher : I\u2019d also \u2013 this is Jeff. I\u2019d also tell you that, one of the things we're seeing is much like it came out of the dotcom boom, where, there were thousands of tech companies and that then really reduced down to a core group of companies that emerged as the largest companies in the United States today. And the reason is similar to the environment were in today, is that in tougher periods like we're in right now, with mortgage, within a higher interest rate environment, clients are more apt to talk to us and listen to our pitch about changing their behavior that they're looking for cost efficiencies.  A couple of years ago, when the market was at its peak in terms of transaction volume and everybody's busy in making money, it's actually hard in an environment to convince people to change their behavior. But our team has been really seeing a lot more success now in this environment with people focused on the new model that we\u2019re bringing, as Ben mentioned, a subscription, SaaS-based model that that has deep connectivity across the mortgage ecosystem that will allow them to save money and ultimately pass those lower costs on to consumers. And so, it's actually a pretty good environment for us to try to advance a different model across the industry. Michael Cyprys : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. Craig, please go ahead. Craig Siegenthaler : Good morning, Jeff. Warren. Hope everyone\u2019s is doing well. My question is on disposition potential. ICE has always been pretty opportunistic in terms of buying businesses to make strategic sense and sometimes selling ones too. But are you looking any businesses today that may not make strategic sense or its upscale or maybe would be even more valuable to another party.  And I'm partly thinking about your fixed income execution business, which you maybe with upscale, but it's within a great fixed income franchise. It's benefiting from both bond ETF adoption and the migration to e-trading. Jeff Sprecher : That's a really good question actually. I don't want to focus on specifically our fixed income business, but let me speak broadly. And the answer is, yes. I feel like as a management team, we promise that we're going to deliver growth. And sometimes we can do that by building new technologies as we just talked about in mortgage.  Sometimes we do it by acquisition and sometimes, it's better to do dispositions and reallocate the capital. And, and I think, through the history of this management team, we've not been afraid to spin businesses out. We've obviously acquired a lot of businesses and we're good at integrating businesses. It's actually pretty strong domain capability of this company. But we also are good at organizing businesses and spinning them out.  Ben oversaw along with some Black Knight people, the ability to put together their loan origination platform and take it to market. So, we're not afraid to move businesses around if there's value there. The other thing I would say to you is that, if the market doesn't appreciate of the overall footprint of ICE, it's you as an investor and an investor advocate, think that some of the parts would be better organized differently. Then as a management team, we should be open to that. We like actually running smaller, flatter businesses that have entrepreneurial bents to them. And so the complexity of being a large organization actually can sometimes frustrate that. And so maybe unlike many management teams, we like being small and nimble. So, a longwinded answer of saying, yeah, we look at everything. And we do meet routinely all the people on this call. We meet routinely to go through all of our business units. And what our competitors are doing, what the landscape is and think about whether there are opportunities to organize differently. Craig Siegenthaler : Thank you, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Alex Kramm from UPS. Alex, please go ahead. Alex Kramm : Yeah, hey back so soon. Just a quick one on the Fixed Income and Data business. On the Fixed Income Data, recurring revenues in particular, I know there's a couple moving pieces here for the flat growth year-over-year. But now, if you think somatic and you step back right? Fixed income markets are in a position of strength for the first time in \u2013 I don\u2019t know, 15 years or so. And people are getting excited about all these changes and flows into CDs and whatever is happening out there that we haven't seen in so long. Systematically, I don't understand, like, why this is not helping the business more. Or do you think there's still some things going to the come, because it just seem like there's been a period of uninvestment and as Fixed Income managers now have you no more strength, I would assume that they're looking to to modernize some of their solutions? Warren Gardiner : Hey, Alex. This is Warren. I think you make some really good points and I would echo those. I think right now, though, in terms of our business and the customers that were facing, they are still licking their wounds little bit from what was a pretty tough 2022. But as you're alluding to, there are some green shoots if you will I mean, we've had some good Fixed Income flows for the first couple months of the year. I don't want to predict anything. But it kind of feels like at least relatively speaking, you've got some stabilization in interest rates. And then - and as you said earlier, I mean, this all of a sudden becomes a pretty attractive asset class, broadly speaking. And so, look, I think, there are customers right now, and we've seen this, when I talk about sales cycle, things like net new fund growth and things like that.  Though that's part of the slower sales cycle, that's a component of our growth. But as you know, we just said and you said it too, like it seems like things are getting or stabilizing a little bit, and you've got a potentially very attractive asset class. So we're encouraged by that. And I think as we look to the second half, we do have some easier compares to that were facing.  And I think all \u2013 if you pull that all together, it's all pretty encouraging. But also I think, don't lose sight of what's going on in the rest of the Data business. So we talked about it too. I mean, other Data and Network Services, we had some really strong growth in our desktop business, up double-digits. Our strong growth in our Analytics business.  Within that, in part driven by some of the commodity customers. It's also helping our Exchange Data business. And so, we've had some pretty good results and that's the benefit of having some diversity across different types of solutions in different asset classes and helping to drive what overall for the segment was another good quarter of double-digit growth and margin expansion.  And again sort of a testament to the not only the old weather nature of that particular segment, but really the business overall. Alex Kramm : Okay. Fair enough. And then, since we are in over time I'm going to squeeze one quick one in there, for Ben. Ben you mentioned the Data and Analytics in mortgage as a sign of area of strength, but sequentially that business was actually down a decent chunk. So, I don't know if there is seasonality, but just making sure that people are not also, trading down there or getting rid of some services that they've been have purchased in the past. Benjamin Jackson : Thanks Alex. So, while you did allude - you alluded to the slowdown in the business, you got to look at it as well though. It is up 10% against a market that\u2019s sequentially down 20 and year-over-year down 60. So the backdrop is still tough.  Historically, when you go back to when we bought the Ellie Mae business, this business was heavily transaction-oriented. So that's why if you look over time each quarter the results in this business has been a little bit volatile, because we've been just like on the origination side, we have made a concerted move to moving more and more customers towards subscription.  In the fourth quarter, and then again in the first quarter, we moved some pretty substantial customers that were on heavily transaction-oriented deals more towards subscription and gave up some transaction revenue to do so. So that's some of the noise that you saw in there. But some of the tailwinds we have in this business, as well as within the spring of last year, we mentioned we won a major global bank in JPMorgan Chase coming onto our AIQ platform.  And we have now implemented them. They are live and we're going to start seeing revenue contribution from that. So there's a nice tailwind there. We also - based on the interesting data sets that we have and the unique datasets that we have on our loan origination system, we've recently been engaged by the CFPB. And they've engaged us to help improve their average prime lending rate.  So the lending rates that they put out to consumers, that's the average to give them a benchmark of am I getting a fair deal? When we're underwriting a loan, they've engaged us to help provide them our data to help improve that index. So we think that's just one of many examples of data offerings that we will have in the future.  And the other thing I\u2019d point to is that, were feeding a lot of our data sets into other parts of our business. Like our ICE Data Services business to improve our mortgage-backed securities pricing. And then, we also launched those rate lock Futures last year that we believe is a very interesting risk management tool to help with some of the basis risk that you have in the mortgage space when producing a mortgage, whether it's a long-term mortgage lock that you have or you have jumbo loans in your portfolio.  You have pretty significant basis risk versus treasuries and the TDA market when doing that. And in April, we saw 11,000 contracts executed on those rate lock Future. So, there's a lot of green shoots there within data. And I think you'll see that feed multiple different line items in the future as those develop. Alex Kramm : Right. Great. Thanks for the follow-ups. Operator : Thank you. That is now the end of the Q&A session. We will now hand back over to Jeff Sprecher, Chair and CEO for closing remarks. Jeff Sprecher : Well, let me thank you, Lauren for being today's operator and thank you all for joining us this morning. I want to also send out a special thank you to Rich Repetto of Piper Sandler, as many of you know he dialed in very early this morning in order to open today's questioning, as he's done every quarter since our initial public offering in 2005. And we understand that Rich plans to move on to new opportunities this summer.  So I represent everyone in the room when I say that, we will miss hearing his thoughtful questions going forward. And Rich, I just want to say, thank you for your commitment to following our company and our progress. And in your absence, please know that we're going to continue to strive to innovate for our customers and build an all-weather business model that will continue to grow.  With that, have a great day, everyone. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your line.",

All lines will be muted during the presentation portion of the call with an opportunity for questions-and-answers at the end. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to pass the conference over to our host, Katia Gonzalez, Manager of Investor Relations. Katia, please go ahead. Katia Gonzalez : Good morning. ICE's second quarter 2023 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2022 Form 10-K, second quarter Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC. In addition, as we announced last year, ICE has agreed to acquire Black Knight. The transaction is still pending regulatory approval and we expect to close in the second half of this year. In connection with the proposed transaction, ICE has filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 to register the shares of ICE common stock to be issued in connection with the transaction. The registration statement includes a proxy statement of Black Knight that also constitutes a prospectus of ICE. Please see the Form S-4 filing for additional information regarding the transaction. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP terms in the earnings materials. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, references to revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain items. With us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chair and CEO; Warren Gardiner, Chief Financial Officer; Ben Jackson, President; and Lynn Martin, President of NYSE. I'll now turn the call over to Warren. Warren Gardiner : Thanks, Katia. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our second quarter results. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.43, up 8% year-over-year, driven by total net revenues of $1.9 billion. This marked the best second quarter on our company's history and it was on top of 14% adjusted EPS growth in the second quarter of 2022. Second quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $756 million, $7 million below the low end of our guidance range, and up 2% versus the prior year. Higher SG&A, including an increase in spend related to an uptick in IPO activity late in the second quarter, as well as higher D&A and rent, both of which were driven by handful of lease write-offs as we consolidate our real estate footprint was offset by higher capitalized labor and lower professional fees. This strong performance helped to drive an adjusted operating margin of 60% and a 5% increase in adjusted operating income to $1.1 billion, which was on top of 14% growth in the second quarter of 2022. Looking to the third quarter, we expect adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $760 million to $770 million with the year-over-year increase driven by additional compensation and technology expense, as well as roughly $10 million of FX. As a result, we now expect the full-year adjusted operating expenses will be between $3.04 billion and $3.06 billion, and towards the lower end of our guidance range. Moving below the line, adjusted non-operating expense totaled $84 million in the quarter, improving sequentially due to higher cash balances as we build consideration for our acquisition of Black Knight, as well as higher interest rates on those cash balances. Shifting to the tax rate. As the increase in the UK tax rate became effective in April of this year, we confirmed our ability to make certain U.S. tax elections, which primarily led to a second quarter adjusted tax rate of 22%. As a result, we now expect to be around the low end of our 24% to 26% guidance range for both the second half and full-year. Now let's turn to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Second quarter net revenues totaled $1.1 billion, up 9% year-over-year. Transaction revenues of $736 million were up 12%, driven by 33% growth in energy revenues. This strong performance included 52% growth in global natural gas revenues, driven by a record quarter for both TTF volumes and participation, as well as 9% growth in our environmental revenues. In addition, we continue to see robust trends across our global oil business, particularly our crude oil benchmarks, Brent, Murban, Dubai, WTI, and Midland WTI, with ADV up 26% year-over-year in the second quarter, and open interest as of the end of July, up 21% year-over-year. Importantly, this is helping to drive strong open interest trends across our global commodity futures and options complex, including 15% growth in global energy and 21% growth in Ags. Recurring revenues increased by 2% year-over-year, including 6% growth in exchange data services, which was once again driven by double-digit growth in the number of customers consuming our global energy and environmental data. This was partially offset by our Listings business, where capital markets activity through much of the first half was relatively muted. However, the IPO markets started to open up towards the end of the quarter with the NYSE acting as the backdrop for 91% of total capital raised in the second quarter. In addition, the NYSE continues to lead the industry with a total of 12 operating companies transferring from other exchanges so far this year, representing a combined market cap of roughly $100 billion. Turning now to Slide 6, I'll discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services segment. Second quarter revenues totaled $546 million, up 6% versus a year-ago. Transaction revenues increased by 23%, including 17% growth in ICE bonds, and 25% growth in our CDS Clearing business. Excluding the impact of the Euronext migration, both recurring revenues and ASV grew by 4%, driven by strong growth across our analytics, desktop and feeds offerings. Within Desktops, we continue to see strong demand from energy and environmental focused customers, as well as continued robust growth in our ICE Chat offering with the number of users has grown at a 15% CAGR over the last five years to nearly 120,000 at the end of 2Q. This growth has been driven by the investments we have made to reduce friction across the workflow, including the development and refinement of a proprietary large language model within ICE Chat. And as a result of these enhancements, through the first half of this year, we have seen a nearly 60% increase in energy volume executed through our ICE Chat platform. Lastly, within our consolidated feeds business, investments we have made to elevate and enhance our offering continues to pay dividends, evidenced by double-digit revenue growth and a number of wins both in the quarter and first half driven by displacement of larger multi-asset class incumbents. This collective performance is a key driver of our other Data and Network Services business, which increased by 7% in the second quarter and 9%, excluding the impact of Euronext. In our Fixed Income Data and Analytics business, similar to the last few quarters, we experienced an extended sales cycle within our End of Day Pricing business. Somewhat offsetting was a return to year-over-year growth in our Index business, driven by growth in ETF assets under management to record $526 billion as of the end of 2Q. Let's go next to Slide 7, where I will discuss our Mortgage Technology segment. Second quarter Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $249 million. Recurring revenues, which account for nearly 70% of segment revenues totaled $164 million and helped to drive outperformance versus an industry that experienced nearly 40% decline in origination volumes. While data and analytics recurring revenue grew double digits year-over-year, and nearly two-thirds of our Encompass customers up for renewal during the quarter did so at higher minimums, growth was offset by those electing to renew at lower levels as well as reduced spend on ancillary products such as our CRM and marketing solutions, which tend to be utilized by customers that are more refi focused. Importantly, the vast majority of these customers not only remain on the Encompass and ICE Mortgage Technology platform, but have also signed multi-year contract renewals. While macro conditions appear to be stabilizing and year-over-year pressure on forward-looking application volumes appears to be moderating, evidenced by a mid-teen decline in July applications compared to a nearly 30% decline in 2Q and a nearly 50% decline in the first quarter, current cyclical pressures are now likely to drive our recurring revenue growth into the low single-digit range for the full-year. However, these same cyclical conditions and the need to reexamine legacy cost structures continues to attract customers that have not traditionally utilized the ICE Mortgage Technology platform. As an example, the top five bank that elected to replace their in-house solution with Encompass as their system of record for the retail channel last quarter has now also signed on as an Encompass customer for their correspondent channel. In addition, CrossCountry Mortgage, a top 15 lender and Encompass user, signed on to utilize our analyzers and what was one of the largest data and analytics deals in our history, following JPMorgan's adoption of our Analyzer suite last year. While these wins will take time to implement and are therefore not expected to impact our 2023 recurring revenues, it's a clear example of the increasing need for workflow efficiencies. And we expect there to be continued momentum through the balance of this year and into 2024. Moving to Slide 8. In summary, it was a record first half. We delivered revenue, operating income, earnings per share and free cash flow growth. We continue to make strategic investments across our business and future profitable growth opportunities. And we are well positioned to meet the evolving needs of our customers and create value for our shareholders. I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A, but for now, I'll hand it over to Ben. Benjamin Jackson : Thank you, Warren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 9. Amidst the dynamic macro environment we've witnessed in the first half of 2023, our customers continue to rely on our leading technology, mission-critical data and transparent and accessible markets to manage their risk. Across our commodities markets, average daily volumes increased 17% in the quarter and were up 7% when compared with the first half of 2022, including a 16% growth in energy and a 27% growth in our agricultural portfolio in the second quarter as customers respond to changing weather patterns given the El Nino conditions and its impact on commodity supplies. In energy, the globalization of natural gas and the evolution towards cleaner energy are trends that we began investing in over a decade ago. And today, cleaner energy sources, including global natural gas and environmentals, make up over 40% of our energy revenues and have grown double digits on average over the past five years. This strong performance has contributed to an average annual growth rate of 8% in our energy platform over that period, growth that is a direct result of staying close to our customers, understanding their evolving risk management needs and expanding the breadth of the content that we offer across our energy network. In our oil markets, ICE's Brent benchmark, the largest crude oil futures and options market in the world, has undergone its latest evolution with the addition of Midland WTI into the Brent basket, creating a new Midland exposure for the oil market to manage. Reflecting this dynamic, ICE Midland WTI reached record volumes during the quarter, along with a series of open interest records in July. In addition, commercial customers continue to demand more additional, more precise hedging tools and that we are in a unique position to provide, given their correlation to our benchmark contracts such as Brent. This trend is best illustrated by the continued growth of our other crude and refined products line, up 17% in the first half and up 33% in the second quarter. In our natural gas markets, driven by a record-setting quarter in our TTF gas benchmark, revenues were up 32% in the first half, including 52% growth in the second quarter. In addition, open interest trends in our global gas complex remained strong through July, up 16% year-over-year, including a 34% increase in our TTF complex and a 15% increase in our North American gas business. Importantly, because we have built a global platform that spans benchmarks across North America, Europe and Asia, we are well positioned to continue to benefit from both the near-term volatility and the long-term secular growth trends occurring across these markets. In our environmental markets, as we look out over the longer term, corporates and market participants remain committed to environmental policy to reduce carbon emissions. This is illustrated by continued growth in active market participants, up 9% year-over-year. Importantly, because we offer one of the broadest suite of environmental products across the carbon cycle, we remain excited about our position to serve customers as they navigate the journey to cleaner energy and as the demand for transparent pricing in carbon grows. Some recent examples of customer-led innovation include the launch of futures on Washington State's carbon program, along with soon-to-be launched futures on Alberta's carbon program, which is expected to go live in the third quarter. In summary, as the energy evolution continues to introduce new complexities, uncertainties and volatility to energy markets, our global environmental markets alongside our global oil, gas and power markets provide the critical price transparency and risk management tools that will enable participants to navigate this evolution. Moving to our Fixed Income and Data Services business. Our comprehensive all-weather platform continues to generate compounding revenue growth, up 9% in the first half. This growth was underpinned by both recurring and transaction revenue growth, a testament to the strategic diversification of our business and our ability to deliver growth through an array of macroeconomic environments. Interest rate volatility as well as continued efforts to build institutional connectivity across our platform contributed to a 51% increase in our ICE bonds business in the first half versus last year. In addition, we continue to see returns on past investments made in our other data and network services business, which is up 7% in the first half driven by strong growth across our analytics, desktop and feeds offerings. Turning now to our Mortgage business. In the second quarter, our Mortgage business once again outperformed a broader industry that experienced a nearly 40% decline in origination volumes. This continued outperformance is a result of executing against our strategy of leveraging our mission-critical technology and data expertise to accelerate the analog to digital conversion happening in the industry. Part of that strategy is intentionally shifting more business to recurring revenue, particularly within our origination technology and data and analytics business. And during the second quarter, of the Encompass customers that came up for renewal, over 60% increased their base subscriptions. Importantly, where customers decline in subscriptions, the trade-off is a higher per-close loan fee, which will provide an uplift in transaction volumes when the market returns. In addition, we continue to have constructive conversations with customers as they seek greater workflow efficiencies. For example, the top five banks that elected to implement Encompass as their system of record for the retail channel last quarter has expanded their relationship with us, signing on as an Encompass customer for their correspondent channel. And during the quarter, we had one of the largest data and analytics deals in our history with the signing of CrossCountry Mortgage to implement our analyzer offering. Importantly, increased workflow efficiency through continued electronification is a secular trend we believe will continue through a variety of mortgage origination environments. This trend gives us confidence that we can grow a business that today is only a fraction of the $10 billion addressable market that is in the early days of an analog to digital conversion. Our ability to capture this secular trend is illustrated on Slide 22 of the appendix. While origination volumes on the Encompass platform in the first half were comparable if not slightly below those seen in the first half of 2018, pro forma IMT revenues have increased over 50% with recurring revenues growing at a 14% compounded annual growth rate. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey Sprecher : Thank you, Ben, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Please turn to Slide 10. I'll begin by touching on our pending acquisition of Black Knight. While we are unable to answer any questions on this call relating to the pending litigation with the Federal Trade Commission, I'll briefly discuss our announcement to divest of Optimal Blue. On July 17, we announced that we entered into an agreement whereby contingent on the close of our acquisition of Black Knight, Constellation Software will acquire Optimal Blue for total consideration of $700 million. This consideration includes $200 million of upfront cash and $500 million in the form of a seller finance note, which we have committed to place into the market within six months following the transaction close. We intend to provide additional performance details upon the closing of Black Knight, but it's worth noting that we continue to target revenue synergies of $125 million and expense synergies of $200 million by year five. As a result of our agreeing to sell Optimal Blue, our federal trial was rescheduled to August 14. And we are in a dialogue with the FTC about potential resolution. The transaction with Constellation Software will keep Optimal Blue and the Empower loan origination system together under a single, highly credible owner. A related agreement will continue and expand our commercial relationship to facilitate Optimal Blue being made fully available to ICE's customers on our open network. As the largest distributor of Optimal Blue via our network, we remain very excited about the value and efficiencies that the combined ICE and Black Knight entities will bring to the end consumer as well as to other stakeholders across the mortgage ecosystem. Shifting to ICE's strong results, please turn to Slide 11. In the second quarter, we grew revenues. We grew adjusted operating income, and we grew adjusted earnings per share, delivering the best second quarter and the best first half in our company's history. These record-setting first half results reflect on the quality of our strategy and more importantly, on the execution of that strategy. We've deliberately positioned the company to have a mix of transaction and compounding subscription revenues, giving investors upside exposure while hedging our downside risk. We've intentionally diversified across asset classes and geographies so that we are not tied to any one cyclical trend or macroeconomic environment. We've placed the company at the center of some of the largest markets undergoing an analog to digital conversion. We believe that the combination of these factors is what makes ICE an all-weather name that generates growth on top of growth. Looking to the second half of the year and beyond, we are positioned to capitalize on the secular and cyclical trends occurring across asset classes. And we remain focused on executing on the many growth opportunities that are in front of us, extending our track record of growth. Before I end my prepared remarks, I'd like to thank our customers for their continued business and for their trust. And I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contribution to our record second quarter, making this an unsurpassed first half result for our company. With that, I'll now turn the call back to our moderator, Bailey. And we'll conduct a question-and-answer session until 9 :30 Eastern Time. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Please go ahead, Dan. Your line is now open. Daniel Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the mortgage side. So curious as to what percentage of Encompass customers have gone through the renewal process. You've given some updates on the kind of renewal and what people have been doing. But curious about where you are in that full process. And then broadly looking forward on the mortgage side, there is an outlook that we've kind of bottomed in terms of activity. Looking at your guidance implies that we're still going to have some pressures for the remainder of this year, but as you think about the overall macro backdrop, are you anticipating volumes here in the second half to start to recover? Benjamin Jackson : Hi, Dan, this is Ben. And great questions. Thank you. In terms of the first part of your question of what percentage of the customers have renewed, so we started this process really a couple of years ago. We've had the Ellie Mae business now for three years, and we started talking about this just a couple of years ago. Most customers are on agreements that are around four to five years in duration. So we're roughly halfway through that transition. In terms of how the business is doing from a longer term perspective, we feel great as we've been talking about on many of these calls, how we've been repositioning the ICE Mortgage Technology company to really unlock long-term growth potential. And underneath the covers, we've seen a lot of success towards that. The evidence to that effect is that over the last several quarters, we've mentioned that we've had success renewing more than 60% of our customers at higher subscriptions. And even when we do see that 40% or so or less that are renewing at lower subscription fees, the trade-off there is that we're getting a higher per-close loan fee on each of those. So when the market normalizes, that will be a tailwind towards our transaction revenues. The second thing is we have continued to see in the second quarter some headwinds from M&A consolidation and going out of business, although it's been relatively small. I think the other thing that we've seen in the first half that were in some of our prepared remarks were that there are some ancillary products that roll up into our origination line item that are not Encompass that are more CRM and marketing-oriented platforms that are very targeted towards helping our lenders identify refi opportunities with clients. And the refi environment continues to be very tough, obviously, with the rate environment where it is. Those contracts tend to be one year in duration. They're user-based. And that is an area where the first half of this year, we saw some pretty significant headwinds towards subscription revenue. But we're already seeing some small signs that, that's turning. And when the market normalizes, we feel good about that coming back. In terms of offsets, we continue to have great sales success in the second quarter of this year on the back of Q4, which we mentioned was strong. Q1 was our best ever. Second quarter was our best second quarter in the last six years. We have 41 new clients come onto the Encompass platform. Now of those clients that come on, many of them are midsized clients that come on right away. We start recognizing subscription revenue right away on those clients. There's also a percentage of those clients that are significant large clients such as the large top five global bank that we had mentioned as well as the win with CrossCountry Mortgage in the D&A space. These clients take time to implement. And the way to think about those is that those will start to have an impact on subscription revenue come 2024. And then once those clients are implemented, there's all kinds of new loans that are coming on to our platform and onto our system that we've never interacted with before that we'll start getting additional transaction fees from as well as they interact and consume services off of our open third-party network and we get per-close loan fees from those loans as well. So from a long-term perspective, we feel great about the positioning. Operator : Thank you. The next question today comes from the line of Benjamin Budish from Barclays. Benjamin, please go ahead. Your line is now open. Benjamin Budish : Hi there. Good morning and thanks so much for taking the question. I wanted to maybe follow up a little bit on the Mortgage segment. There's a lot of dialogue around sort of the ongoing digitization and sort of similar to the question in terms of the contract renegotiation cycle. I kind of wanted to ask about the cross-sell some of your existing products like AIQ in particular. Just curious where you are in terms of the penetration of the current customer base and how far you think that can go? Benjamin Jackson : Thanks, Ben. This is Ben. So great name by the way. So from a cross-sell perspective, that's the beauty of this business that we've established that when you look across all of the offerings that we have across our ICE Mortgage Technology network, we touch almost every lender with some of our \u2013 with one of our services on our platform. And we have 3,000 of them that are on our Encompass platform. And we continue to have great success across the spectrum of bringing in new Encompass customers that are utilizing other services that we have on our network and getting new wins across all of the segments that we service. So think of whether it's a bank, a nonbank originator, a broker, a credit union, we continue to have success across each of those segments. And we've also leveraging the overall enterprise that ICE brings to bear. We've been able to leverage that to reposition and have some wins with large banks replacing legacy infrastructure that historically, the business wouldn't have been well positioned to win. So we feel great about that part of the business. In the environment that we're in, we have seen customers very focused on rightsizing their organizations rightfully so with the headwinds that they've seen. And they've been very focused on the core platforms that they run, and Encompass is one of the key ones. So that's why we continue to see great strength there. At the same time, innovative companies and entrepreneurs that are thinking ahead don't want to have to \u2013 as the market is going to turn, and it will turn at some point, don't want to have to chase volumes by hiring armies of people. Again, they want to try to automate and become as efficient as possible in their processing. And that's why we continue to have great success in areas such as AIQ, which we've now rebranded to our ICE data and document automation platform. And some of the examples that we talked about in the prepared remarks were JPMorgan Chase, obviously, significant bank selected us last year. They've just gone live on the platform this year. So we're starting to see some of that to come into our performance. And on the back of that, a top 15 lender and CrossCountry Mortgage has now selected us. So we see innovative companies out there looking to invest in efficiency and automation going into the future. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today comes from the line of Alex Kramm, UBS. Please go ahead, Alex. Your line is now open. Alexander Kramm : Yes. Hey, good morning everyone. Just a quick one on pricing, actually. Last quarter, you obviously made some price moves on the energy trading side. It looked like that came through pretty nicely. So just wondering any lessons learned from there, and can you extend that into other areas is really the question? I mean, you didn't touch any other Futures businesses. Maybe broadly on the Exchange side, around market data and some of the success you're having in energy data in particular, are there more opportunities for pricing that you see now versus previously since you've gone through this experience on pricing here? Warren Gardiner : Yes. Alex, it's Warren. It's a great question. And so in terms of the pricing changes we made within the energy complex, as we said last quarter, those were a handful of oil contracts. So we didn't touch everything within energy, but certainly decided at that moment in time, it was a good moment in time to capture some of the value we brought to the asset class over the last number of decades, frankly. And so we spoke to you last quarter, mentioned there would probably be a few pennies of benefit to the RPC. I would say it's about \u2013 it was about $0.03 to $0.04, if you will, so in line with what we were expecting on that front in terms of the benefit from those price changes, all else equal. As we look across the rest of the futures platform and frankly, the rest of the ICE platform, the philosophy as we approach and apply here is going to be the same and has been the same since the beginning. And that's when we see opportunity to capture value that we've created for people and our customers and the asset classes that we operate, we'll think about doing that and frankly, be selective about it and pick our spots. And so I think as you're thinking about that as we move into next year and future years as well, we'll be taking that same approach. And so we did have some success with this on the energy side. Again, I think it's a recognition of, again, the value we created because we certainly see very strong volumes and very strong open interest continue. And I think you'll just see us take a similar approach across the rest of the ICE business as we move into our budget season this year and think about it into the future. Alexander Kramm : So more of a next year opportunity is what I'm hearing from you. Sorry for the quick follow-up. Warren Gardiner : So I wouldn't expect pricing changes this year. So yes, it will be next year and beyond. Operator : Thank you. The next question today comes from the line of Simon Clinch from Atlantic Equities. Please go ahead, Simon. Your line is now open. Simon Clinch : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could just talk a bit more about the environmental products business, and just how that's progressing right now. And so what it's going to take or when we should start to expect to see the growth rates really resume the kind of attractive pace that we saw in previous years prior to last year. Benjamin Jackson : Thanks, Simon. This is Ben. As you know, we've been thinking about this space for well more than a decade and investing in it. And we feel great about the positioning that we have here, and we're just continuing \u2013 continue to be one of our most significant areas of investment across our futures business because we see that the world is going to continue to have this dynamic of moving towards a cleaner energy environment. That road is going to be bumpy. And the fact that we can enable customers to have on that journey a complete suite of products across oil, gas, power and environmentals, that positions us in a very unique way to help our clients in one place be able to do all of that. On the \u2013 how the performance of the business itself, we feel good about it. You got to remember, in particular, in Europe, there were some headwinds, obviously, last year, both in energy and in the environmentals sector with the unfortunate war in Ukraine. We continue to watch the health of those markets. Obviously, our energy markets have come back very strong. And we continue to monitor both open interest trends as well as market data subscriptions within our environmental complex, which is at a record. We're looking at \u2013 we continue to look at active market participants. That continues to grow in our environmentals. So underneath the covers, it's a very strong market. We have 98% market share of the EUA market space and of what's traded at 96% in North America. So all that underneath the covers is really good. There's some natural tailwinds I mentioned last quarter as well within the European market itself, where a little less than 40% of the sectors in the European economy are required to basically price emissions. And with Fit for 55 coming in place, by 2028, there's another close to 40% that are going to be captured such as maritime roads, buildings. So this is all secular growth drivers towards our European business. Our North American business continues to grow in terms of market participants. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we just recently launched a new Washington carbon program, and we'll be launching later this quarter an Alberta carbon trading program. So it's another area of investment. Another area that we've been thinking about and have been ahead of actually shows up in our oil business, but it's also really environmentally oriented. And that's the high demand for low-carbon fuels. We've been ahead of this, and we've launched contracts called RIN futures. And what these are is basically every year, the EPA sets standards, in other words, guidelines for the amount of renewable fuels that need to be blended into transportation fuels each year so that you can create sustainable jet fuel, renewable diesel when we're filling up our cars, putting clean unleaded fuel into our vehicles. To meet this target, there's a certain amount of production of renewable fuels that are produced, and those get renewable identification numbers. These are bought, sold and traded historically but in a very opaque market. We launched futures on this as a much more efficient way to do this and we continue to see this grow in open interest as well as ADV very rapidly. It's one of the highest growth areas in that other crude and refined reporting line that we mentioned in our prepared remarks. And today, in the last 12 months, we saw roughly 20% to 25% of the physical market under the EPA mandate trading via our futures. And as futures markets mature, they oftentimes trade a multiple of what the physical market is. So it's another area across our portfolio where we're focused on the environmental space. We're looking ahead, and we're seeing some nice growth. Operator : Thank you. The next question today comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW. Please go ahead, Kyle. Your line is now open. Kyle Voigt : Hi. Good morning. Just regarding the elongated sales cycle you mentioned again this quarter, we're seeing some competitors that have also experienced a similar dynamic, but other competitors, including one including one that reported this morning, noted that they're not seeing that elongated sales cycle in their enterprise data business. I guess I just want to hear whether you think there are any competitive share shifts that are occurring in that Fits business that you can see, or whether the slower growth is really entirely driven by the macro environment that we're in. And then also, if you could give some commentary as whether you're seeing any light at the end of the tunnel there in terms of inflections that you're hearing from clients that we may be getting to a better sales cycle environment as we head into 2024. Lynn Martin : Hi, Kyle, this is Lynn Martin. Thanks for the question. So on the elongated sales cycle, if you look at the Fixed Income and Data Services business, we're definitely seeing it abate when you look at the other data services line. As Warren mentioned in his prepared remarks, we've actually been able to take share from some of the larger incumbents as a result of the significant amount of investment that we've made over the past few years in the delivery, in modernizing the tech stack associated with that business. So you're definitely seeing the elongated sales cycle abate there, given the share we're taking. On the fixed income data and analytics side of the business, we still see some of the effects of the elongated sales cycle. But importantly, what you're seeing is we are taking share in our End of Day Pricing business. We're continuing to take share there. We're continuing to see good growth in some of the smaller line items that make up that overall line item, including the Index business, which, as Warren said in his prepared remarks, is now about $526 billion in AUM benchmarked against it and some of the products that really go along with the trend of automation. So let me just unpack that a little bit. If you look at the big buzz word of the year in the industry, it's really been around the development and implementation of large language models. We're seeing good demand for, and as Warren mentioned in his prepared remarks, the adoption of our proprietary large language models. And you're seeing the effects of that come through in not just our other data services line and the revenue attributed to that line, but you're also starting to see that in other parts of our segments, including the energy trading side of our segment. Additionally, those large language models in a different asset class are what feeds things around fixed income automation, which is a trend that we continue to be uniquely positioned to capitalize on. So products like continuous evaluated pricing, smaller line item but it continues to see outsized growth relative to the other portions of the fixed income data and analytics side of the business. And because of the strength in that part of the business, you're seeing that bleed into the ICE bond execution side of the business, which outpaced the industry in spite of muted volatility in our core muni markets because of share gains due to that automation, the transparency provided by our data as well as the adoption of institutional customers for these services across not just our muni products but also our REITs, our money market products and importantly, starting to see it in our credit products. So overall, we feel really good about how we're positioned. We're not seeing anything in terms of share erosion. On the contrary, we're continuing to see share gains in our core business, but we still are seeing the effects of the elongated sales cycle really in the End of Day Pricing business, which is causing slightly slower growth. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. Please go ahead, Craig. Your line is now up. Craig Siegenthaler : Hey, good morning everyone. My question is on the Fixed Income business. So given the higher interest rate backdrop, many are predicting large bond reallocations over the next few years. So I wanted to see if you could walk us through your Fixed Income and Data Services business and provide your perspective on how this reallocation could impact the growth trajectories of the verticals inside this business. Lynn Martin : Hi. This is Lynn again. That's a great question. So a couple of areas as you think about where the yield profile continues to lead. Obviously, the attractive yields in treasuries more recently is what has really driven some of the outsized gains that I just mentioned on the execution side of the business for the treasury execution business and the money market products that we have. The contrary to that you've seen is on the fixed income index business, where our capture rate, as we talked about on some of the previous calls, tends to be lower on our treasury index business. So AUM continues to grow, but it doesn't have a direct correlation to the revenue growth. It's not a one-to-one relationship. As you're starting to see the issuance profile start to return to normal, you will see that in a reallocation of assets under management to the higher capture indices, that being our credit indices, the muni indices and obviously, with the equity markets doing well, our equity indices. But you'll also start to see that impact our pricing and reference data end-of-day business because you will start to see new fund families emerge, new asset funds emerge, which you've not really seen over the last year. In contrast, over the last year, you've seen \u2013 where it's been particularly tough for the fixed income asset managers, you've seen the number of funds decline. We're starting to see green shoots for the reemergence of new funds being created. So I think you'll see a positive impact on a variety of our line items. But again, this is why we've set up the business in the Fixed Income and Data Services segment, in particular, to be an all-weather name to benefit from a variety of macro trends. So treasuries do well. That's going to impact the segment in one way. If munis do well, it's going to impact the segment in another way. Operator : Thank you. The next question today comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, Brian. Your line is now open. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks very much for taking my question. Maybe just to come back to the ICE Chat offering and the proprietary large language models. And particularly in energy, I think you mentioned it was helpful in stimulating volumes so far this year. Maybe if you could just talk a little bit more about what's actually driving that, how does the Chat offering add volume. Is it bringing new customers into the mix such as market makers? And then where would you think you are on this journey? It sounds like it's relatively new, but do you think you've already sort of enhanced the volumes with this or there's a lot more to come in the future? Lynn Martin : Yes. This is Lynn again. That's a great question. It's actually a topic we love talking about. So we've had the existence of large language models in our ICE Chat offering for quite some time now. We started with the early stages of it, I'd probably say about a decade ago. But it's really been refined over the last, call it, five years. It's become a contributor though to the energy markets across asset classes, across oil, across gas and across \u2013 starting to impact the utilities as well. Effectively, what it does is it allows for automation. It knows if you and I are talking about the fact that today is Thursday or it knows if we're talking about a trade idea through those models. If it detects a trade idea, it will allow for the seamless transmission of that trade to our clearinghouses and our trading platforms. Additionally, it will give you some fair value analytics and additional metrics around it to allow you to perform that trade with confidence that you're getting a good price. So it's really helping the trader to automate the workflow. It's why it's gained popularity, particularly over the last couple of years as those models have gotten smarter as the technology has improved, quite honestly. But I think we're still in the early stages of this. It's still a small contributor to our volumes, but it's something we're incredibly excited about the potential for not just in energy, but if you think about the rest of the Fixed Income and Data Services segment for fixed income where fixed income markets are desperately requiring automation. So we think this \u2013 the concept has applicability pretty much across all of the markets that we operate, but we're seeing the early-stage benefits in the energy markets, as Warren mentioned in his prepared remarks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today comes from the line of Patrick Moley from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Patrick Moley : Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I just wanted to go back to energy. As you mentioned earlier, you're seeing strong volumes, strong open interest growth. I think even though you've had some easier comps, I think it was still the strongest 2Q in your history. So just when we look at the macro landscape, I was hoping you could maybe give us your outlook for the back half of this year in energy. And I think my predecessor asked this on the last call, but is there anything out there right now that maybe you're keeping an eye on that could derail the strong momentum you're seeing in energy? Thanks. Benjamin Jackson : Thanks, Patrick. This is Ben. So it's clear to us that you got several underlying trends going on in the industry. You continue to have well-publicized underinvestment in legacy energy infrastructure that can cause supply shocks. You've got overall and broadly, electronification, and energy markets continues to take hold. But each of the energy markets and the new innovations that we continue to launch are at various ends of the spectrum of how mature they are in adopting electronification. The energy markets are becoming more global. As supply chains continue to evolve and change, those markets are becoming global, and natural gas is now freely transported around the world in terms of LNG. You also have a trend around precision and risk management. Customers don't just want to trade big benchmark contracts, but they want to trade those in parallel to deep liquid markets that are at the point of production and consumption of where they're concerned about and have to actually buy the product. And there's no \u2013 questionably, the last trend would be a move towards greener energy. And we've built our business with a very long lens towards helping our customers manage risk through all of these. We have a deep liquid set of contracts, hundreds of them around the world. We have a lot of different pricing points across each of those sectors, whether it's commodities, energy, cleaner fuels, environmental markets, gas, power, you name it. We built our business with that diversification and with our customers' needs in mind. And we see the setup is great for us. You look at just the results that we've had. We're at or near an average daily volume market share high in crude oil and across our global oil complex. We're adding open interest market share high in North American gas and global gas. We're at or near an all-time revenue share high in June across energy. We've had record active market participation in multiple products such as TTF gas and continuing to grow rapidly in the environmental space. And our futures markets continue to set records in terms of market data subscribers on to our platform. So overall, we feel great about all those underlying trends. And then to cap it off, you look at what's been going on with Brent, and that being from a futures and options standpoint the largest oil benchmark in the world. A lot of the products that we have are very complementary to that. And with some of the significant changes that are happening were dated Brent, our contract now has Midland TI oil coming into it. The fact that we saw that coming launched our Midland WTI, our ICE Midland WTI contract known as HOU, that contract continues to grow very well. And since Midland TI was introduced into the Brent complex this summer, we've seen that contract continue to grow rapidly. And we've had over 50 million barrels of oil that has now been delivered against that contract. So we feel great about the prospects of where we're positioned, both for the balance of this year and into the future. Operator : Thank you. The next question today comes from the line of Alexander Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, Alexander. Your line is now open. Aditya Soman : Hi. Good morning. This is actually Aditya filling in for Alex. Thanks for taking the question. Another question within fixed income on the execution side. We've seen continued progress in fixed income execution, although from a small base. You've been adding capabilities here with the recent launch of the Sweeps Protocol. Can you provide more KPIs for this business? What are your electronic markets like in IG and high yield? Where do you see it going over the next 12 months? And lastly, how does price compare to incumbent platforms and protocols that you compete in? Thanks. Lynn Martin : Yes. This is Lynn. Thanks for the question. So traditionally, on the execution side, we've operated in the \u2013 our core market's really been the muni market. Now I think what's really encouraging about this quarter is you saw strong growth from us even though the muni markets have had muted volatility, muted activity this quarter. And I think that's really been attributable to the fact that we really have spent the last couple of years building out our distribution framework and focusing on building our distribution framework and getting access to the institutional users, but also continuing to gain share in retail and wealth. So despite the fact that the muni markets have been quieter in Q2 than over the last year, we were able to gain share, continue to gain share in the retail and wealth side of the business. Now importantly, because we had done the development efforts and the integration efforts into the institutional side of the business, the treasury markets, which had a much more attractive yield profile, were able to have outsized results, which drove the growth in this quarter, which you saw that coming from not just retail and wealth segments, but also the institutional side of the business. And as you noted, we have made significant investments in the technology because the distribution has been there into the institutional side of the business in addition to the traditional wealth and retail side of the business. When we upgraded the technology to perform our sweeps as we announced earlier this week, we've been able to start to gain a bit of share on the corporate side of the business, U.S. corporates in particular, particularly investment-grade over the last few months. Now that's still very early days, but we're optimistic because of the investments that we have made in the platform not just on the technology side, but also building the distribution over the last couple of months and doing it on a market-by-market basis. Operator : Thank you. There were no additional questions waiting at this time. So I'd like to pass the call back over to Jeff Sprecher for any closing remarks. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Sprecher : Well, thank you, Bailey. Thank you all for joining us this morning. And I'd also like to again thank my colleagues for delivering the best first half in our company's history. And I'd also like to thank our customers for their continued business and for their trust. We look forward to updating you again soon as we continue to innovate and build on this all-weather business model that generates growth on top of growth. And with that, I hope you all have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

There will be opportunity for questions at the end of the presentation. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand you over to your host, Katia Gonzalez, Manager of Investor Relations to begin. Please go ahead. Katia Gonzalez : Good morning. ICE's third quarter 2023 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2022 Form 10-K, third quarter Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP terms in our earnings materials. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, references to revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain items. With us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chair and CEO; Warren Gardiner, Chief Financial Officer; Ben Jackson, President; and Lynn Martin, President of NYSE. I'll now turn the call over to Warren. Warren Gardiner : Thanks, Katia. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our third quarter results. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share was a record, totaling $1.46, up 11% year-over-year. Net revenues totaled $2 billion and on a pro forma basis, increased 4% versus last year, driven by double-digit growth in our Exchange segment which was led by 22% growth in our futures platform. Third quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $812 million, including $56 million related to Black Knight and $756 million related to legacy ICE, which was $4 million below the - of our original guidance range, largely driven by lower technology spend, including reduced cloud exposure as we continue to optimize and drive efficiency through our data center footprint. As we move into the fourth quarter, we expected adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $955 million to $965 million, with the increase relative to the third quarter, driven by additional rent, D&A and seasonality and capitalized labor as well as a full quarter of expense related to Black Knight. Moving below the line. Adjusted nonoperating expense totaled $114 million, including $41 million of incremental interest expense related to our acquisition of Black Knight. We expect adjusted nonoperating expense in the fourth quarter to between $225 million and $230 million, largely driven by the full core impact of acquisition-related interest expense. It is also worth noting that we have reduced our term loan and CP outstanding by around $700 million since transaction closed in early September. Now let's turn to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Third quarter net revenues totaled $1.1 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Transaction revenues of $754 million were up 13%, driven by 42% growth in our energy revenues. This strong performance included 48% growth in global natural gas driven by a record quarter of TTF volumes. In addition, we continue to see robust trends across our global oil business with ADV up 40% year-over-year in the third quarter and open interest at the end of October, up 26% year-over-year. As we look to the fourth quarter, it's worth noting that we expect OTC and other revenue to be in the range of $70 million to $75 million, with the third quarter benefiting from a few items that we don't anticipate will repeat. In addition, and in light of the strong performance in our equity options business, where revenues are up 15% year-to-date, we've elected to a regulatory fee holiday, which will temporarily reduce OTC and other revenues by $10 million to $15 million in the fourth quarter. Shifting away from transaction revenues. Recurring revenues increased by 4% year-over-year, including 8% growth in Exchange data services. which is once again driven by double-digit growth in the number of customers consuming our global energy and environmental data as well as a benefit of a few million dollars related to audit recoveries, which we don't expect will repeat in the fourth quarter. This was partially offset by our listings business where growth in annual listing fees was offset by the rolling off of initial listings fees related to the strong IPO market in 2021. Turning now to Slide 6, I'll discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services segment. Third quarter revenues totaled $559 million, up 4% versus a year ago. Transaction revenues increased by 6%, including 9% growth in ICE bonds and 5% growth in our CDS clearing business. Excluding the impact of the Euronext migration, both recurring revenues and ASV grew by 4%, driven by strong growth across our desktop, feeds and derivative analytics offerings. Within our desktop business, revenues once again grew double digits as we continue to see strong demand from energy and environmental-focused customers as well as the continued robust growth in our ICE chat offering in part driven by growing adoption of large language models. In our consolidated feeds business, we once again grew high single digits and expect to exceed $100 million of revenue for the full year as we continue to realize the benefits of past investments to enhance our platform. In our fixed income, data and analytics business, we generated a record $279 million in the third quarter with sequential growth in revenue driven by our North American pricing and reference data business or PRD. While PRD growth may continue to be below trend in the near term, we're seeing signs of an improved sales cycle alongside strong retention. Let's go next to Slide 7, where I will discuss our Mortgage Technology segment. Third quarter Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $330 million, including $87 million related to Black Knight. Recurring revenues totaled $235 million and on a pro forma basis, $396 million, representing nearly 80% of total pro forma segment revenues. Despite the headwinds facing the mortgage industry and the related near-term pressure on our recurring revenues, sales continued to be robust as customers look to reshape and modernize how they do business. Through October, we have already surpassed our prior full year record for new Encompass sales, which was set in 2020. In our servicing solutions business, the closing of the Black Knight transaction has unlocked the pipeline with four new MSP customers signed October alone, including a top 25 servicer, Fifth Bank. This compares to a total of five signings through the first nine months of the year and has quickly put 2023 on track to be the second best year for MSP sales since 2017. In addition, as we look to 2024 and continuing the momentum, we have seen post close, the current pipeline for MSP is at its highest level in five years. While we expect the secular trend of customers seeking greater efficiency across their workflows to continue, it's important to note that these strong sales results will take time to implement. And looking to the fourth quarter, we anticipate near-term cyclical headwinds will persist, coupled with typical seasonal pressures on origination volumes in the first and fourth quarters of each year, we expect the total fourth quarter IMT revenues will be in the range of $490 million to $500 million, bringing full year pro forma - revenues to approximately $2.06 billion and in the middle of the guidance range we provided on our Black Knight closing call in late September. In summary, at a consolidated ICE level, we once again grew revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. And as we look to the end of the year and into 2024, we remain focused on meeting the needs of our customers, continuing to drive growth and to create value for our shareholders. I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. For now, I'll hand it over to Ben. Benjamin Jackson : Thank you, Warren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 8. I would like to first welcome the Black Knight team to their first ICE earnings call. While it has been less than two months since we closed on the acquisition in early September, we've been very impressed by the collaboration between our teams during this short time, a testament to the talent of our respective employee populations and our shared entrepreneurial cultures. Similar to our exchanges and fixed income businesses, Black Knight integrated into our ICE Mortgage Technology network, a network that thrives by offering a value proposition that aligns growth with efficiency gains that we bring to our customers. As we have seen across our network in futures and fixed income, these efficiency gains are best achieved through harnessing unstructured data to create mission-critical information, seamlessly linking participants to that information and ensuring that the network technology underpinning are of the highest quality and security. It is the execution of this value proposition that often propels an analog to digital conversion of an industry, and it is a blueprint we've applied across all our businesses. A number of years ago, we saw the importance of investing in an energy platform that is truly global, one that better serves the needs of an evolving and growing commercial customer base. Today, as trade dynamics evolve and become increasingly complex, customers are not only seeking liquidity in the major gold benchmarks, but also in products that provide for greater hedging pursuit. Our global oil complex spans over 700 products, including locational spreads, product spreads and refining spreads. These products are built off of our benchmark contracts, such as Brent crude oil and gas oil. Driven by the breadth of our commercial customer base, we have become the natural home for liquidity in these products with open interest in our oil complex up 26% year-over-year through the end of October, including a 28% increase in our other crude and refined products. In our natural gas markets, we began investing in the globalization of these markets over a decade ago. Today, our European TTF and Asian JKM gas complexes continue to grow and reach important milestones as they evolve into global gas benchmarks. In the third quarter, the number of participants in each market grew double digits year-over-year and TTF reached another quarter of record volumes. This strong performance helped drive record revenues across our natural gas complex through the first nine months of 2023, up 37% year-over-year. In addition - interest trends for TTF and JKM remained strong through October, up 58% and 19% year-over-year, respectively. This strength continues to underscore the significance of our contracts to the price formation of global natural gas. We are well positioned to both benefit from the near-term volatility and the long-term secular growth trends occurring across these markets because we operate a global gas market with benchmarks across North America, Europe and Asia. In our environmental markets, we recognize the importance of carbon price transparency over 10 years ago by acquiring the Climate Exchange in 2010 and building around those leading markets to develop a global environmental business. As we look out over the longer term, corporates and market participants remain committed to environmental policy to reduce carbon emissions. This is illustrated by continued growth in active market participants, up 9% year-over-year. Importantly, because we offer one of the broadest suites of environmental products across the carbon cycle, we remain excited about our position to serve customers as they navigate the journey to clean energy and as the demand for transparent pricing in carbon grows. In summary, these cleaner energy sources combined, including global natural gas and environmental make up over 40% of our energy revenues today and have grown 17% on average over the past five years, including a 30% growth year-to-date. As the clean energy transition continues to introduce new complexities, uncertainties and volatility to energy markets, our global environmentals, alongside our gas and oil complexes, will provide the price transparency across the energy spectrum needed to manage these evolving risks. Moving to our Fixed Income and Data Services business. As fixed income markets electronify and passive investing grows, our comprehensive all-weather platform continues to generate compounding revenue growth, up 7% year-to-date. Investments we've made to enhance content and functionality across our other data and network services business continue to pay dividends. Year-to-date, this part of our business is up 7%, driven by strength across our desktop, derivatives analytics and feed offerings as customers continue to modernize workflows. Within our desktops business, the investments we have made to reduce friction across the workflow have contributed to double-digit revenue growth year-to-date, along with double-digit growth in the number of users that connect to our ICE Chat platform. Similarly, within our consolidated feeds business, investments we've made to elevate and enhance our offering have led to accelerating adoption by large financial institutions. This has directly contributed to high single-digit growth in this area year-to-date. In addition, we continue to see strength in our index business driven by double-digit growth in ETF assets under management as of the end of the third quarter, with now over $0.5 trillion in assets selecting ICE indices as the passive benchmark. As we move forward, we will continue to build on our track record of adding efficiencies and bringing transparency to opaque asset classes, leveraging our mission-critical data assets and market-leading technology. Turning now to our mortgage business. Like what we saw in the commodity markets 20 years ago, there's an analog to digital conversion occurring in the U.S. residential mortgage industry. Critical to our ability to execute on this opportunity is our network, one that in combination with Black Knight, spans from consumer acquisition all the way through to the secondary market. In the third quarter, our mortgage business once again outperformed the broader industry that experienced a nearly 20% decline in origination volumes. This continued outperformance is a result of executing against our strategy of leveraging our mission-critical technology and data expertise to accelerate the analog to digital conversion happening in the industry. Part of that strategy is intentionally shifting more business to recurring revenue, particularly within our origination technology and data and analytics business. And during the third quarter, of the Encompass customers that came up for renewal, roughly 60% increase their base subscriptions. Importantly, where customers decline in subscriptions, the trade-off is a higher per closed loan fee, which will provide an uplift in transaction revenues when the market returns. In addition, part of our thesis has been at clients that have origination businesses, combined with servicing businesses, we want to bring together a complete front-to-back experience for their clients through one trusted platform provider. As mentioned last quarter, JPMorgan Chase has selected Encompass for their loan origination system across all channels and has implemented or is implementing our data and document automation platform. These wins are on top of a long-standing, great relationship with MSP for servicing, which now positions us to provide a platform to help facilitate their front-to-back experience for their clients. And since we closed on Black Knight, I am pleased to share two new wins along the same lines. First, M&T Bank has now selected Encompass to replace their existing loan origination platform and has added our data and document automation platform on top of the existing MSP relationship for servicing, again, positioning us to provide our platform to support the front-to-back experience for their clients. The second new win is with Fifth Third Bank. We have cross-sold MSP and several data and analytics products to Fifth Third Bank, an existing IMT customer, our consumer engagement solutions and all regs product. In summary, these are major wins for us and serve as a validation of our vision with large clients bringing together a complete front-to-back experience for their clients through one trusted platform provider. The relationships with these great customers are models we plan to replicate with many more. Increased workflow efficiency through continued electronification is a secular trend we believe will continue through a variety of mortgage origination environments. This trend gives us confidence that we can grow the business that today is only a fraction of the $14 billion addressable market that is in the early days of an analog to digital conversion. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey Sprecher : Thank you, Ben, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Please now turn to Slide 9. The idea to start ICE came in the late 1990s, an idea to take advantage of the move of commerce to the Internet and an idea to capitalize on changing government regulations regarding energy procurement. The subsequent dot-com crash and the collapse of Enron created a very difficult business environment, particularly the trading of energy. But it was in this challenging environment where ICE was able to gain a toehold into the market and build the foundation for a growing business in commodity trading, a business that, as you've just heard, continues to flourish more than 20 years later. Sometime around 2006, we came across a newspaper article about credit default swaps and the difficulty that this market was having settling such contracts. We became convinced that ICE could build a clearinghouse infrastructure that could solve these delivery problems. Our colleagues took up the challenge and we acquired targeted platforms and talent. Two years later, when the financial crisis of 2008 froze the CDS markets, we were in a position to offer a sustainable solution. And when the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 and the European Market Infrastructure Act of 2012 required the use of clearinghouses in the over-the-counter swaps markets, ICE was able to expand what has now become another significant business for us. I tell you these stories not as some kind of victory lap, but to remind you of our repeated experience that the best time to lay the groundwork for a strong future is when your target customers are experiencing stress and are open to new vendors and new platforms to alleviate their problems. I also remind you that evolutions in regulation in the financial services industry typically follow periods of economic change and that standardized, open and transparent platforms, such as those that ICE operates, can benefit. A1nd ultimately, I call your attention to our history to answer a question that we've been asked, why is ICE investing in a consumer finance technology platform via the mortgage market? And why do it now? We spoke on our recent call following the closing of our acquisition of Black Knight about our aim to build financial market infrastructure across the company that can offer earnings and dividend growth in variable market conditions, all weather growth that will allow our shareholders to have confidence that they won't have to time their investments into and out of - an episodic earnings stream. There are currently many stress points across large portions of the U.S. mortgage industry and ICE is experiencing an openness from market participants and its regulators to consider new solutions delivered by our comprehensive technology platform. This is why Warren and Ben were able to tell you in specifics about the encouraging reception that we're receiving for our vision to rewire the mortgage market. And why Ben shared our success with platform clients like JPMorgan Chase, M&T Bank and Fifth Third Bank, all of whom are significant sophisticated drivers of the market. The same economic stress that exists in the current U.S. mortgage market is, in converse, fueling growth on our commodity hedging and credit protection platforms, which benefited ICE's record third quarter earnings. We're positioning ourselves to transform the U.S. mortgage market while it is under stress with a goal to create opportunities to springload our future growth and contribute to our all-weather earnings and dividend growth road map. Another topic that we're being asked about a lot is our adoption of large language models and learning algorithms. ICE has long been investing in adaptive learning tools beginning more than a decade ago when we incorporated learning tools into our growing ICE Chat system as a way of automating workflows based on unstructured trader and back-office conversations. We're also - we've been deploying learning models in our compliance effort to recognize trading and use patterns that deviate from norms. Ben mentioned, our ICE Mortgage Technology product, now called Data and Document Automation, which is an extension of the learning model that we acquired within Ellie Mae. This product recognizes a wide variety of documents that end up in a consumer file when underwriting a loan, documents such as pay stubs, tax returns, bank statements and alike, which the algorithm automatically identifies and places in appropriate digital folders. The model extracts key structured and unstructured data elements from these folders for further validation by a credit team via a workflow that detects exception cases for the compliance team. Our model is based on a transparent rules engine, which we believe will assist our customers and their regulators to comply with the President's recent private letter ruling on model fairness, integrity. And our model is being further extended by us across our expanding mortgage platform. Our experience in building and deploying these learning models also facilitates our research into the cost of computation that is associated with model queries, and it permits us to have a thoughtful understanding of the cost benefit analysis of their deployment and the model's extension. When we acquired the New York Stock Exchange, it was built on a technology stack that was overly complicated, hard to manage and unreliable. So we set off to completely rebuild the underlying architecture with modern technology. Given the importance of the New York Stock Exchange to the global economy, we had to rebuild the exchange while it was in daily use. And its extensive connectivity to the global financial services industry demanded that we not ask our customers to invest in making changes on their side of the firewall. So, we wrap the old technology with a modern front end and methodically rebuilt and replaced all of the back-end hardware and software. This process took us years to execute with our successful final software rollout just a few days ago, deprecating the last of its seven unique legacy matching engines. Our upgrade blueprint worked. And today, the New York Stock Exchange sits atop one of the most powerful, deterministic performance and resilient tech stacks in the world. This same plan to build a new bridge while the cars continue to drive across it was deployed by us when we acquired Interactive Data Corporation. There, we inherited over 100 legacy servers, many of which literally could not be shut down for fear of not being able to properly restart them. We, again, replaced this mess with a modern data superstore over a period of six years and without sacrifice from our customer base. When we made our initial investment in MERS, its technology was outsourced, and was not able to keep up with the demands placed on it during the financial crisis. Our business deal with MERS ownership consortium was to rebuild the platform within two years. If successful, we had an option to buy and run the company. We did just that. And MERS is now a cornerstone to our broad US mortgage industry platform. With our acquisition of Black Knight, we've again undertaken a blueprint to wrap its legacy technologies, tie it to our mortgage platform for near seamless integration with our customer base and rebuild its tech stack with a modern architecture over the coming years. As I've mentioned on past calls, ICE is agnostic to cloud providers, but we also operate our own proprietary cloud with ICE data centers having connectivity to a vast portion of the global financial services industry. This allows us to oversee our costs and stand behind our performance, a cloud strategy that Warren mentioned was a contributor to our record earnings in the quarter. In summary, my comments today highlight three backdrops that ICE follows to evolve our all-weather business model. We invest in environments that may have fallen out of favor and at times when customers need us the most. We embrace regulatory shifts and the workflow alterations that inevitably follow periods of economic change. And we embraced an experiment with new technologies, while enhancing technology assets that we may acquire to drive platform efficiencies and better serve our customers. Shifting now to ICE's strong results. Please turn to Slide 10. In the third quarter, we delivered the best quarter in our company's history with record revenues, record adjusted operating income and record adjusted earnings per share. We have intentionally positioned our company to provide customer solutions in numerous geographies and economic conditions to facilitate all weather results. These record-setting third quarter results against our extraordinary third quarter results of last year are another example of strong execution across our platform. And I'd like to end our prepared remarks by thanking our customers for their continued business and their trust. And I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contributions to our best ever quarterly results following up on our unsurpassed results of the first half. And with that, I'll now turn our call back to our moderator, Lauren, and we'll conduct a question-and-answer session until 9 :30 Eastern Time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Ken, please go ahead. Ken Worthington : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about ICE oil. So you mentioned last quarter that Midland was added to Brent, and we've seen trading of Brent - I'm sorry, trading at Midland take off. I'm curious how you think Midland is impacting the trading of Brent? And to what extent Midland is a contributor to ICE's increased share in WTI? And then I guess, most importantly, how much of the benefit to ICE is left as we look forward? Or has the positive impact already played out? Benjamin Jackson : Hi, Ken. It's Ben. Thank you for the question. We see all the investments that we've been doing in our oil platform as a truly global platform that's all complementary to one another. As the clear trend around the world has been under investment in energy infrastructure, so you have a lot of volatility in energy when there's any kind of supply shocks. You've got electronification continuing to take hold. You have energy markets that are truly global. You got supply chains that are evolving and changing and people are looking for more precision and risk management. So with all the investments that we've been making in our global oil platform, we take all that into account, we're engaging with customers now more than ever, and we're getting feedback that there's a need for more precise instruments, pricing Middle East oil that's destined for China. That's what created that Murban contract and ICE futures Abu Dhabi, and it's grown nicely. In parallel to that, Brent, which is the centerpiece of that entire complex is up both in OI and volume year-over-year. So we see them as complementary trading assets that run side by side. We also continue to see investments like our HOU contract in the U.S., which is pricing Midland barrels coming out of Midland, going into Houston and then eventually making its way into our dated Brent contract. We're seeing that contract also continue to grow. So we see these all as very complementary assets to one another. And even within the Middle East itself, you look at our Dubai contract. That contract is up in volumes 80% year-over-year, with OI up close to 50% year-over-year. So we, again, see them all as very complementary assets that traders look at both for the precision that, that particular instrument provides, but then also trading them in parallel to the other benchmark contracts. Ken Worthington : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Budish from Barclays. Ben, please go ahead. Ben Budish : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on some of the commentary around the wins in the mortgage business. Just to what degree do you think that some of the MSP wins and some of the cross-selling, is that a result of things ICE is doing differently since acquiring the asset? To what degree is it perhaps pent-up demand, things were maybe stalling while the merger was pending? And if that's the case, what do you think about the pipeline? How sustainable is that growth versus perhaps a compression of some built up - or some pent-up demand over the last many months? Thank you. Benjamin Jackson : Yes. Thank you for the question. And as we've said in a number of calls, our hypothesis has been that the combination of these businesses will create, for the first time, an opportunity for our clients to have one d1 trusted platform provider for that complete front-to-back experience for their clients. And you heard a lot from in our prepared remarks about the sales success across our platform. And we believe that based on that success as well as the funnel we see ahead of us, that we have a platform that's really spring loaded as the market normalizes as loans are growing. And just unpacking some more detail what's going on under the cover. So we mentioned we had a solid Q3 in Encompass sales in the third quarter and then also in October. And as Warren pointed out in his prepared remarks, we've had a record sales year and we still have a couple of months to go in the year. So that's playing out very well for us. As we mentioned, we won M&T Bank, that's already an existing MSP customer. They're adding both Encompass and our DDA platform. We've won TriPoint that's moving to Encompass. And then we've also had an expansion with a client called The Federal Savings Bank, adding our data and document automation platform on top of the existing Encompass relationship. There's - switching to MSP. There's no doubt that there was some pent-up demand on MSP as there was an overhang on the deal with clients waiting to see how it was going to come through. And now we're seeing a number of deals that have come through. We mentioned Fifth Third Bank replacing their existing platform provider. They're also adding a number of data products as part of that deal as well. We've also added Black Hills Federal Credit Union, which is an existing Encompass client, has now added as I look at it, is incredibly strong. And - but as Warren also commented in his prepared remarks, this is core infrastructure that's going into these clients, and it does take time for them to implement across both MSP as well as on the loan origination side. You've got a six to 18-month window to implement these clients. But then once implemented, we're getting new loans under our platform and on our network. So the final thing I'd point out is we're also not losing customers. We're not losing significant customers on the platform. And that's why I used the comment that we're spring-loaded because as we see the market environment is going to normalize at some point in time, the loan growth that we've had in our platform positions us very well to achieve those long-term objectives of the growth criteria that we've outlined. Ben Budish : Great. Thanks for all the incremental color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Dan, please go ahead. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. Questions on the fixed income data. I think, Warren, you mentioned improved sales cycles. Was hoping you could expand upon that. And then also, as you think about next year, and pricing, how we might think about - or what has been the typical price that you've raised or the percentage increase and maybe how that might be different in this type of inflationary environment? Warren Gardiner : Hi, It's Warren. So I'll talk a little bit about the pricing, and I'm going to hand it over to Lynn to talk about some of the color on what we're seeing on the fixed income data analytics side. So on the pricing side, we - it would have been a couple of years now that we talked about a third or so of the growth we felt like would come from pricing. I'd say that, look, it will move around each year, so it's not necessarily perfectly consistent in that way. But certainly, as you look over the last number of years that we've had the IDC asset, it's been pretty much in that range. And so as we're thinking towards next year, I think it's fair to be thinking that will continue. And it's underpinned by the philosophy you've heard us articulate a number of times on these calls and that we really just look to capture value when we bring it to our customers. And that's really what we're doing when we think about price within the fixed income and data analytics business and really across the platform. So we're going to continue to do that in that business, similar to what we have over the last couple of years. Lynn Martin : Yes. And it's Lynn. I'll just chime in with some color of what we're seeing. As we said on previous calls, this segment, in particular, really shows the all-weather nature of ICE. And if you look at the execution side of the business, ICE bonds, in particular, had really strong growth over the last quarter, particularly given the muted volatility in the muni markets where we've been able to continue to increase our adoption by the retail and wealth side of the businesses as well as benefit from the increased adoption by institutional users contributing to share gains in all of our different products. Now bringing that through to the fixed income data and analytics side of the business, as we've continued to interact with the front office customers, we've seen continued increasing demand for our front office tools. So while small contributors to the overall bottom line, products like CEP, best execution that we've talked about in the past, there continues to be strong demand for those products as fixed income markets continue to electronify. You've seen that manifest itself in a shortening sales cycle, which has been a - which has really benefited us in terms of the pipeline contribution, the pipeline conversion rates in the short term. Additionally, as we've continued to see money flow into fixed income ETFs, as is evidenced by 30% growth year-on-year at the end of Q3 into our index AUM, we've continued to see that manifest itself in terms of demand for the data, demand for our indices, demand for services around our indices. So we continue to be optimistic that we're uniquely positioned to capitalize on the trend of fixed income electronification and the optimization of workflows in fixed income. Dan Fannon : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt from KBW. Kyle, please go ahead. Kyle Voigt : Hi. Good morning. So there have been some headlines over the past couple of days around the NAR lawsuit being decided in favor of the plaintiffs. And there's some pressure around what that means down the road for the number of buy side real estate agents needed to serve that US mortgage market and the percentage of home sales that will even have a buy-side agent involved in a transaction. I believe buy-side agents are the largest referral pipeline of deal flow for loan officers, which are core Encompass clients. I guess if we see less buy-side agents being used in the market, and loan officers lose their largest referral pipeline, I guess do you foresee any material share shifts for who is originating loans within the mortgage ecosystem? And if so, how do you believe that could impact Encompass, if at all? Benjamin Jackson : Hi, Kyle. This is Ben. It actually - those types of trends play into our overall thesis and hypothesis in this space is that there is opportunity to create more efficiency around the transactions. For us, we're neutral in that space. We don't have a business of selling leads to real estate brokers and the like. For us, our core businesses are all in and around the origination transaction itself, making sure that we're matching the client to the ideal product that meets their needs at the lowest cost to improve access to homeownership as well as clients that have an existing home, identifying based on data and analytics the best product to cross-sell to that client, the best time for clients to have a servicing book as well as an origination book. So when we talk about that whole front-to-back offering, that's really our sweet spot. So we don't see an impact to us negative. If anything, all of the data and analytics offerings that we have that underpin this overall platform front to back, both between ICE Mortgage Technology assets that we've had historically as well as the data assets that have come with the Black Knight business, all position us very well in that space going forward. Kyle Voigt : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Alex, please go ahead. Alex Blostein : Hi. Good morning. Thank you for the question. I was hoping we can maybe build a little bit more specificity around the fixed income data and analytics business. If we look at the revenue trends that obviously been sort of challenged here, we know the reasons why around the sales cycle and pricing pressure on fixed income assets. But if you look at the ASV, it's been kind of flat for the last couple of quarters. So maybe just kind of help contextualize what does the improvement sales pipeline and shortening cease mean for revenue growth over the near term, maybe early thoughts into '24? Lynn Martin : Yes, Alex, this is Lynn. Thanks so much for the question. So if you look at the Fixed Income and Data Services segment as a whole, I talked about some of the all-weather nature that attributed really to the fixed income data and analytics line and the executions line in just a bit ago. But the one area that we've continued to see as a really strong contributor to the bottom line, top line is the other data services business and the acceleration of that business throughout the year. And that's really been fueled by a couple of different areas. Number one is our multiyear investment and the modernization of the tech stack associated with our distribution platforms. And on the macro side, is the continued strong demand for our products and services fueled by the broader adoption of automation across the industry in a variety of different areas, which feels like we're still in the early stages of. So we're seeing the confluence of these items benefit the top line growth in this area, and that causes us to be optimistic for continued growth in this area, in particular, for the medium term. We've been very deliberate, as Jeff mentioned on his call to be cloud agnostic and really invest in our own data centers. One of the reasons that we did that was really in response to customer demand as increased automation tends to be a data-heavy area as well as fueling demand for things such as data center space and customers asking us to grow their data center footprint. As a result, and what we've seen more recently, our connectivity sales in Q3 were the second highest in our history. Now those are going to take some time to implement, obviously, before we see the benefits of that in terms of revenue. And our desktop sales last quarter matched our historical high. So we continue to be optimistic that the trends are going to be positive for this area given the pipeline that we have in this area and given the more recent sales that we've been able to achieve. On our feeds business, which we talked a little bit about in our prepared remarks, we benefit from the automation trend as workflows continue to become more automated and customers continue to value the modernization efforts we've undertaken to streamline our technology. So we've been able to attain a variety of new [logos] more recently and then also benefit from historical Tier 1 logos and their increased adoption of our services. And then finally, the area that continues to drive growth in this area, and we think it's the early stages, is the adoption of our large language model, our proprietary large language models in our chat platform. Our chat user growth is up 13% year-to-date, and the increased usage in the models has driven not only revenue benefits here, but also activity generated within our energy markets which activity generated through large language models in our energy markets was up 90% quarter-on-quarter compared to last year and 70% year-to-date. So, there's a variety of trends that we see as tailwinds for this line, in particular, to continue to drive compound and growth for the medium to long-term. Alex Blostein : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Brian, please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks so much. Good morning folks. Maybe just to talk about the synergy - the revenue synergy targets for the Black Knight, the $125 million over five years. And then what you mentioned, Ben, on the Black Knight update call at the end of September, the $300 million of opportunity that you can see now. And then cross-referencing that with some of the examples you've already cited. Maybe if you can just reconcile the difference between those two numbers. And I realize there's still six to 18 month types of implementation time frames, so they take a while to get into the revenue stream. But it would seem like you're certainly on track to easily beat that $125 million ahead of time. So maybe just to talk about your outlook on revenue synergies over the next, say, couple of years? Warren Gardiner : Hi Brian, it's Warren. So, I think, yes, you throw out a couple of numbers there, all correct, of course. But when we think about those revenue synergies, I think the best way to be thinking about it is - and you pointed out one point that I think is important is it takes a little bit long for these to implement. But I think about it more the OpEx of it being more hockey stick like. And so I think in the early year you probably don't have as much, but that as we obviously move to the next couple of years and through year five, you're going to see those start to build. So, - and part of that is, look, we've got to integrate the companies and we start to get going on some of the areas that we've talked to out on not only the core products, but also on some of the data products that we want to cross-sell across the platform as well. And so that takes a little bit of time in addition to some of the implementation timelines we talked about as well. So, I think about it. Certainly, we're going to have some here. Ben talked about a number of wins that we've had. But again, there's going to be an implementation time line for those. But certainly, we are off to a very strong start there, and it's really encouraging in terms of us getting to those targets ultimately. Brian Bedell : Okay, fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Clinch from Redburn Atlantic. Simon, please go ahead. Simon Clinch : Hi everyone. Thanks for taking my call. I was wondering if we could just drill down just to your comments about the mortgage market and the performance of the transaction side. I'm just curious to - I guess, how you're getting your market information on mortgage originations being down nearly 20%. We're hearing sort of different figures thrown around as well beyond that. So, I'm curious of how you build that number. And then ultimately, how are you thinking about what's going into that fourth quarter guide for the IMT pro forma revenues as well? Thanks. Warren Gardiner : Hi Simon. So, we generally look at the composite, the forecasters as you're aware of the NBA, Sandy and Freddie, and we're looking at those. We also have some other data around our loan volumes and, of course, MERS registrations that we all pulled together. And so that - your fair - it's a fair question to ask because, obviously, the forecasters are working with somewhat imperfect information, and you see revisions here and there at times too. So, - but that's generally what we saw. We did see in the quarter some Encompass closed loans down in the high teens. So, I think we did well versus the market. And so that's an encouraging sign, of course. There is, within those transaction revenues, which is what you might be referencing to some extent there, some other elements there. I mean, professional services fees are in there. Now, with Black Knight, we have default management revenues. You've got some MERS registrations that there's deferrals related to. So, there are some things in there that, of course, are not perfectly correlated with what's going on in the mortgage market over this current period, if you will, that will create some noise. But I think in terms of how we're performing within the closed loan component of that, it's been encouraging. And again, it's part of its adoption and new customers coming online at some of the sales we've had. And I think as you move into next year, and certainly based on what you heard from Ben, we continue to have success there. So, I think that, that will continue to drive that kind of an outcome. Simon Clinch : Thanks. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. Craig, please go ahead. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks. Good morning everyone. After the pricing adjustments in the energy complex earlier this year, we wanted to see if you had an update on the ability to adjust pricing in the future, both outside of the energy complex over the near-term and then longer term in the energy business. And we know this has not been a big focus for ICE in the past, but inflation is higher and a key competitive of yours has been more aggressive with pricing hikes. Warren Gardiner : Thanks for the question, Craig, it's Warren. So that's something we're thinking about, I think, as I said on prior calls. And you're right, it's - the headline price changes are not something we had traditionally done. We have always gone into markets and injected market maker tiers and things - in incentive programs and things of that nature. But it's not something that we've done historically at the headline level. We did do it this year, and I think it's been relatively successful. We certainly are, as we move into our budget season here at the moment, thinking about what we might be able to do on that front. I think as we said previously, it's something that we will pick our spots on. I don't expect us to do it on the same products every year. But certainly, we have not done a lot on many other products across, not just energy, but other areas of futures. And so we'll be thoughtful about that. Again, it all comes back to us thinking about what kind of value we've created for the customer and pricing appropriately for that. And so as we think through that, you'll see some - potentially see some announces there. But I don't know that I'd expect it to be on the same products every single year. We'll - again, I think we'll pick our spots as we think through that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Michael, please go ahead. Michael Cyprys : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. We've seen regulators - banking regulators propose new capital rules for the banks, which could make some of their bespoke off exchange-driven products a bit more capital intensive. So, just curious if you're taking that where you guys see the biggest opportunity maybe to bring derivatives from OTC to the exchange-traded market, how you might quantify that? And just bigger picture, just given the capital proposals that can make certain products and businesses more capital intensive for the banks. I guess where do you see the biggest opportunities from that? Jeff Sprecher : This is Jeff. Thanks for the question. I think it's a complicated environment because while the Basel rules are being discussed, every country that we do business in seems to be thinking about implementing them slightly differently, which sort of begs the question, will the market coalesce around a single standard? And who in that coalescing process has the influence to drive the consensus? And we don't really know yet. But you're right in that some of the proposals in the most draconian cases could be significant on banks. And we - if you step back and you just look at our business in a macro level, and I mentioned it even in the prepared remarks that I wrote that ICE believes in standardized, transparent, widely distributed, regulated businesses. And any regulatory or government action that pushes the market towards more transparency and more standardization is good for us. In some cases, I made the point - I tried to make the point in my prepared remarks that it's been my experience that whenever there's been an economic change, either an economic downturn or even an economic upturn as there's a transition to a different economic environment seems like regulators take a look and try to figure out what's different. And we have tended to benefit over the history of this company from those changes. It's partly why I say that we're not anti-regulation, and we are willing to adapt to regulation because I think the kind of way we do business is what ultimately regulators are looking for transparency and wide distribution and standardization. But yes, thank you for the question. We're thinking about it, I think the same way you phrased your question. Michael Cyprys : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Patrick Moley from Piper Sandler. Patrick, please go ahead. Patrick Moley : Good morning. I just had one last one on fixed income. I think last quarter, Lynn had mentioned that as issuance normalizes, you could see AUM reallocation, higher capture indices. I was just hoping to get an update on, from your perspective, what you're seeing there and your expectations going forward? And then just to add on to that, I'm wondering how we should think about the yield profile differences between treasuries and munis and the impact that could have on the business more broadly? Thanks. Lynn Martin : Yes. Lynn, thanks for the question. In terms of the allocation of AUM, we have definitely seen an improvement - variety of equity indices, for example, although they're relatively small compared to our core fixed income indices where you've seen an uptick in the amount of AUM that had moved into them. Those being our biotech, semiconductor and some of our other more bespoke indices. In terms of the fixed income allocation, governments have continued to grow in terms of AUM, but you've also seen higher capture classes such as high-yield, which we're really well known for, investment grade and our unique indices gain some share as well. So it's a bit of everything growing in terms of AUM, but that has definitely slowed into some of our higher capture products, which has resulted in our index revenues growing nicely, particularly as compared with last year at this time. In terms of the yield profile, it's a really good question. You saw our core products such as munis have muted volatility during the summer months, not overly unexpected. You've seen volatility in those products start to spike up again as we enter the fall, and that's really a trend that's continued throughout October, in particular. Treasuries have also been a nice grower for us in terms of transactions. We've also seen growth though in things like CDs and our money market product CDs and then agencies as well. So as I mentioned earlier, we've really seen good growth across each of our different products. If you look at the amount of transactions on our platform in Q3 as compared with last year Q3, in fact, the amount of transactions are up 53%. So I think that really positions us nicely because of all the hard work the team has done to penetrate the wealth side of the business. Obviously, retail has been a good grower for us traditionally and all the hard work that the team has done over the last few years to really build our institutional footprint, which we continue to see expanding both in terms of activity and a number of participants on our platform. So I think we're really positioned nicely going into the more volatile time that we're in right now. Operator : Thank you. That is now the end of the Q&A session. So I'll now hand back over to Jeff Sprecher for closing remarks. Jeffrey Sprecher : Thank you, Lauren, for managing the call, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Let me again thank my colleagues for delivering a record third quarter and definitely want to thank our customers for their continued business and their trust. We'll be updating you again soon as we continue to innovate around our all-weather business model and build solutions for our customers and generate growth on top of growth. So with that, I hope you all have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

You\u2019ll have the opportunity to ask your question at the end of the presentation. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand you over to our host, Katia Gonzalez, Manager of Investor Relations to begin. Katia, please go ahead. Katia Gonzalez : Good morning. ICE's fourth quarter 2023 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2023 Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP terms in our earnings materials. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, references to revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain items. With us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chair and CEO; Warren Gardiner, Chief Financial Officer; Ben Jackson, President; and Lynn Martin, President of NYSE. I'll now turn the call over to Warren. Warren Gardiner : Thanks, Katia. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with a summary of our strong fourth quarter and some key highlights from our record 2023 results. Fourth quarter net revenues totaled a record $2.2 billion and pro forma for the acquisition of Black Knight increased 7% versus last year.  For the full year, revenues totaled a record $8 billion and on a pro forma basis increased by 4% year-over-year. Fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $952 million, $3 million below the low end of our original guidance range driven by lower compensation expense and acceleration of expense synergies. This strong performance helped to drive fourth quarter earnings per share of $1.33, up 6% year-over-year and record full year adjusted EPS of $5.62, also up 6% versus 2022.  2023 free cash flow totaled a record $3.2 billion enabling us to return nearly $1 billion to shareholders through dividends, while also continuing to make strategic investments to reserve September acquisition of Black Knight. These strong cash flows, as well as the full divestment of Black Knight\u2019s stake in Dunn & Bradstreet enabled us to reduce debt outstanding by roughly $700 million in the fourth quarter and by $1.4 billion since we closed on our acquisition in early September. As a result, adjusted leverage ended the year at approximately 4.1 times pro forma EBITDA.  Now let\u2019s move to Slide 5 where I\u2019ll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Fourth quarter net revenues totaled a record $1.1 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Transaction revenues of $781 million were up 22% in part driven by a 31% increase in our interest rate business and record energy revenues which grew 46% year-over-year.  This strong performance included a 41% increase in our oil complex, 66% growth in global natural gas revenues, driven by another record-setting quarter for TTF and 23% growth in our environmental business.  In addition, January set the tone for what we expect will be another strong year evidenced by robust levels of total open interest in January, up 20% year-over-year including 22% growth in global energy and 23% growth in Ags, as well as record average daily volumes across commodities, energy and total options.  Shifting to recurring revenues, which include our Exchange Data Services and our NYSE listings business, revenues totaled $355 million in the fourth quarter. Similar to last quarter, growth in the number of customers consuming our global energy and environmental data was partially offset by the rolling off of initial listing fees related to the strong IPO market in 2021.  It\u2019s worth noting that despite a slower year for IPOs across the globe, the NYSE led the industry in transfers for a second straight year including a total of 32 transfers from other exchanges.  Looking to 2024, we expect recurring revenues in our Exchange segment to grow in the low-single-digits driven by continued strong growth in futures exchange data, somewhat offset by growth in our listings business with pressure on initial listing fees abating in the second quarter.  Turning now to Slide 6, I\u2019ll discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services segment. Fourth quarter revenues totaled a record $563 million, up 4% versus a year ago including transaction revenue of $116 million. For the full year, transaction revenues increased 19%, in part driven by23% growth at ICE bonds which since our acquisition of BondPoint and TMC has grown at a CAGR of 11% driven by growing institutional adoption and higher interest rates.  Recurring revenues totaled a record $447 million and grew by 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. In our Fixed Income Data and Analytics business record fourth quarter revenues of $286 million increased by 4% an acceleration from 2% growth in the third quarter driven by pricing and reference data and a return to double-digit growth in our Index business.  Other data and network services grew 7% in the fourth quarter, driven by continued growth across our desktop fees and derivative analytics offerings. Within our desktops business, we continue to see strong demand from energy and environmental focused customers as well as continued robust growth in our ICE Chat offering. In our Consolidated Fees business we continue to realize the benefits of past investments to enhance our platforms with a record 2023 contributing to the high single digit revenue CAGR over the last three years. Looking to 2024, we expect to have recurring revenues in our Fixed Income and Data Services business will grow in the mid-single-digit range as we expect the aforementioned trends across Fixed Income, Data and Analytics as well as Desktops and Fees to continue.  Please flip to Slide 7 where I will discuss the results in our Mortgage Technology segment. Please note that my comments on revenue growth are on a pro forma basis. ICE Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $502 million in the fourth quarter, slightly above the high end of our guidance range. The recurring revenues of $397 million are accounting for roughly 80% of total segment revenues.  In addition, on a pro forma basis, operating income increased 7% year-over-year. We had a strong finish to 2023 registering one of the best quarters for new product sales including 37 new Encompass clients and four new MSP clients. This strong finish capped off what was the best year since 2018 for Encompass and MSP sales. And while these sales will take time to implement and thus recognized related revenue there is clear momentum across the industry as customers seek technology and data solutions that drive greater transparency and workflow efficiencies. Shifting to 2024 guidance, consistent with the near-term outlook provided on our Black Knight closing call in September, we expect total mortgage technology revenue growth on a pro forma basis to be in the low-single-digit to mid-single-digit range for the full year. The low end of our range assumes only a modest improvement in application and origination volumes, while the high end underwrites a more substantial improvement in the double-digit growth range.  It is worth noting that seasonality tends to benefit both the second and third quarters of each year relative to the first and fourth.  Recurring revenues for the year is expected to be roughly flat including a decline of roughly $5 million to $10 million in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter. We expect recurring revenues to improve sequentially thereafter sales implement with the year-over-year growth reemerging in the second half. The sequential pressure and attrition that we expect in the first quarter is largely driven by two customers that were acquired, one of which was a completed back in 2021. Moving to Black Knight synergies, through the first months, five months post close, we have signed annualized revenue synergies of roughly $30 million or nearly a quarter of our $125 million five year target. It\u2019s worth noting that these signings are not expected to have a material impact on our 2024 recurring revenues and will largely begin to be recognized in 2025 and thereafter.  Synergies have largely been driven by cross-sell success across our flagship Encompass and MSP platform, as well as in data and analytics.  Turning to expense synergies, we expect to realize approximately $135 million in annualized savings by the end of 2024, ahead of our original expectation of roughly $100 million by year end. I\u2019ll conclude my remarks on Slide 8 with some additional guidance. We expect 2024 adjusted operating expenses to be between $3.81 billion and $3.86 billion. Similar to prior years, we expect to continue to invest in our people, our technology, including the enhancement of MSP and various growth initiatives across our business. These investments are somewhat offset by expense synergies which I noted, are expected to reach approximately $135 million in runrate annualized savings by the year end 2024.  Moving below the line, we expect non-operating expense to be between $215 million and $220 million in the first quarter. And depending on the future path of short-term interest rates, these expenses should decline slightly in second quarters as we continue to pay down the outstanding commercial paper and term loan related to our Black Knight acquisitions.  We anticipate the full year tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 26%, up slightly from 2023 through the impacts of a full year higher UK taxes.  And finally, we expect full year CapEx to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million including approximately $100 million relating to Black Knight with the vast majority expected to be delivered \u2013 directed to various technology investments that Ben will detail shortly. And $100 million relating to the new office space in expansion and improvement across New York, London and Jacksonville. In summary, we delivered a very strong finish to another record year of revenues, operating income, free cash flow and earnings per share. We grew our dividend returning nearly $1 billion to our shareholders, while at the same time continued to invest across the business to meet the needs of our customers and expand our mortgage technology networks through the acquisition of Black Knight.  As we kick off 2024, we are focused on once again delivering growth and creating shareholder value. I\u2019ll be happy to take your questions during Q&A, but for now hand it over to Ben. Benjamin Jackson : Thank you, Warren, and thank you, all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 9. We are pleased to report another record year for ICE. Our strong 2023 results were in part driven by a dynamic macroeconomic environment. But more importantly, underpinning that performance, our long-term secular tailwinds that will continue to drive growth across asset classes in a variety of macroeconomic environments.  Across our energy markets, the depth and breadth of our global platform not only drove records across volumes and revenues in 2023, but it positions us well to capture secular tailwinds across our energy complex including the globalization of natural gas and the clean energy transition. In our oil markets, we\u2019ve invested in building a global platform that positions us well to provide the critical price transparency across the energy spectrum that will help enable participants to navigate the clean energy transition. Most recently, ICE\u2019s Brent benchmark underwent its latest evolution with the addition of Midland WTI into the Brent basket. This latest evolution contributed to record Brent volumes in 2023, surpassing the record last set in 2021 and demonstrating that the market depends on its ability to reflect global fundamentals.  At the same time, our WTI contract reached record volumes and continues to gain share. In addition, as trade dynamics evolve and become increasingly complex, customers are not only seeking liquidity in the major global benchmarks but also in products that provide greater hedging precision. This trend is illustrated by the record trading activity in our other crude and refined products in 2023 with volumes up 35% year-over-year. This strong performance has carried into 2024 with January ADV surpassing the record last set in March of 2020 and at the same time open interest is up 36%. In our natural gas markets, we\u2019ve adopted a similar playbook building a global platform that expands benchmarks across North America, Europe and Asia. As energy supply chains evolve and globalize, the quality of our expansive range of benchmarks is evidence with our global gas business delivering record revenues in 2023 increasing 44% year-over-year.  This strong performance was led by record volumes and participation in our TTF benchmark contract which we have positioned as the branch of natural gas and plays a critical role in providing global natural gas price signals. A similar dynamic is playing out in our Asian JKM complex with volumes up 17% in 2023 and continued participation growth including our highest fourth quarter ever. In addition, we continue to see robust open interest trends through January including record total gas open interest of nearly 38 million watts on January 25 surpassing the record set in 2012. This strength continues to underscore the significance of our contracts to the price formation of global natural gas.  We were also early to diversify into environmentals recognizing the importance of carbon price transparency over a decade ago. As we look out over the longer term, governments, corporates, and market participants remain committed to environmental policy to reduce carbon emissions. As such, valuing externalities such as placing a price on pollution, carbon-free electricity, as well as carbon sequestration, and storage will continue to increase an importance. This is illustrated by continued growth in active market participants up double-digits in the fourth quarter. At the same time, 2023 marked another record year in our North American environmental markets, with volumes up 7% year-over-year. Importantly, because ICE has one of the largest networks of environmental products to value such externalities across the carbon cycle, this is a growth trend that we are uniquely positioned to capture.  In summary, the globalization of natural gas and the energy transition are trends that we began investing in over a decade ago and today, cleaner energy sources including global natural gas and environmentals make up over 40% of our energy revenues and have grown 17% on average over the past five years. This strong performance has contributed to an average annual revenue growth rate of 9% in our energy platform over that period including 28% growth in 2023. With our Brent crude oil contract serving as the cornerstone of our energy network, we have expanded the range of contract that we offer to our customers. We have built and continued to enhance our global energy network that delivers comprehensive risk management solutions, provides capital efficiencies and is positioned to grow alongside the continued evolution of global markets, while providing the critical price transparency across the energy spectrum needed to navigate the energy transition.  This large suite of energy risk management tools, combined with our Ags portfolio, which saw record volumes in 2023 and it has consistent open interest records through January makes up our global commodity network of more than 1,000 products and services to help our customers manage risks around evolving supply chain issues, acts of nature and acts of men. Moving to our Fixed Income and Data Services business, market volatility, higher interest rates and secular trends such as the need for increased automation demand for flexible delivery solutions and growth in passive investing contributed to another year of record segment revenues in 2023, up 6% versus a year ago. This strength was once again driven by both transaction and recurring revenue growth, highlighting the strength of our all weather business model. Higher interest rates and our continued efforts to build institutional connectivity across our platform drove another year of record revenues in our ICE bonds business, up 23% in 2023 and that performance was on top of a nearly 100% increase in 2022.  In addition, we continue to see returns on past investments we\u2019ve made in our other data and network services business where revenues grew 7% in 2023. Within desktops, investments we\u2019ve made to reduce friction across the workflow directly contributed to double-digit revenue growth in 2023.  In our consolidated feeds business past investments we've made to elevate and enhance our offering led to a number of wins driven by displacements of larger multi-asset class incumbents, a key driver of the high-single-digit growth in this area in 2023.  Finally, as we move forward, our enthusiasm is focused on continuing to expand and evolve the products and services which add transparency to both commonly understood risks as well as emerging risks that make up our fixed income and data services business. Our climate analytics for example, leveraged our strength in the fixed income market with third-party geospatial data to help market participants better manage climate risk, as part of their overall investing and risk management processes.  Turning now to our mortgage business, similar to the playbook we operate across our global energy and fixed income businesses, in mortgages we are leveraging market-leading technology, mission-critical data and our network expertise to build innovative solutions that drive workflow efficiencies. Our mortgage network expands from point of consumer acquisition all the way through to the secondary market providing a true life of loan offering that positions us to lead the transformation of an industry that is moving analogs to digital.  In this regard, we are pleased to share the closed 37 new Encompass clients in the fourth quarter and four new MSP clients contributing to a record for new sales on Encompass and the highest in the last five years for MSP and Encompass combined.  Building on the Encompass wins mentioned on the last call such as M&T Bank, we added Raymond James Bank for their retail and correspondent channels. We also brought back Carrington, a significant non-bank lender and servicer on to the Encompass platform from a third-party.  For MSP, building on the four wins we had in the fourth quarter, such as Fifth Third that was mentioned on the last call, we closed Capital Mortgage Solutions of Texas, and an existing Encompass client, CapEd Credit Union to start 2024. As we entered 2024, we remained focus on the successful integration of Black Knight in executing on our strategy of relieving the paint points and inefficiencies that exists across the mortgage workflow.  Importantly, our approach remains consistent with the blueprint we have applied across our other networks, one of investing behind secular growth, while enhancing the value proposition of our network. A near term opportunity to drive greater transparency and efficiency, includes integrating Black Knight datasets such as our closing fee data, tax, flood and valuation models into our Encompass and MSP systems. Another near term example is integrating our data and document automation platform into MSP, building a digital bridge from originations straight through to servicing reducing costs, time and errors to onboard loans to the MSP system.  A third example builds upon our lead providing compliance solutions fully integrated into every aspect of the mortgage origination process and moving towards servicing as well. At the same time a near term opportunity is our continued investment in our product and pricing engine further strengthening the mortgage ecosystem by providing additional options and greater efficiencies to lenders, servicers and partners.  In parallel to the near term opportunities just mentioned, we are executing on our investment commitments to continue to advance our market-leading SaaS-based MSP servicing platform, following a similar successful process that we execute against with other companies that we have acquired. Simultaneously, we see an opportunity to advance our digital document vault service that is offered for documents such as eNotes and to extend this as a golden record for other origination and servicing documents to help reduce duplication, improve quality and reduce cost for our customers. In summary, we are pleased to see that the value of our solutions delivered by our comprehensive technology platform is resonating in the marketplace. The demand we are seeing across our platform gives us confidence that we can grow a business that at $2.1 billion in revenue today is only a fraction of the $14 billion addressable market that\u2019s in the early days of analog to digital conversion.  With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey Sprecher : Thank you, Ben. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Please turn to Slide 10. 2023 was a unique year for the energy markets. The year kicked off with a European ban on the import of Russian crude oil and a $60 Russian oil price cap imposed by the US, Japan, Canada and Australia, all driven by the Ukrainian conflict and a forced realignment of the global energy supply chain. In October, painful conflict with Israel erupted that is testing relationships within the energy producing Middle East and which caused the US house of representatives to send the bill to the US senate imposing further sanctions on Iranian oil.  In November, terrorists began attacking ships navigating the Red Sea, causing the world\u2019s largest operators of crude oil tankers to modify their supply chain operations out of their region. And throughout 2023 OPEC+ met the set quotas to cut oil production attempting to drive oil prices higher for the benefit of Russia and Middle East producers.  With this complex geopolitical backdrop, it would be reasonable to assume that we ended 2023 with oil prices pushing towards record highs. Well, that\u2019s not the case. Brent crude oil actually ended the year with prices lower than where the year started marking the first annual price decline since the COVID collapse.  Even the recent supply shocks in oil shipped from the Red Sea failed to rally oil prices for more than a day or two. When we acquired the former International Petroleum Exchange of London in the early 2000s its flagship product was a small futures contract on or then not well-known of oil called Brents. The Brent oil field consisted of four deepwater oil platforms built in the 1970s in the middle of the North Sea between Scotland and Norway.  The waters there are deep and the working environment is hostel. So pipelines were built to move the oil to the remote Shetland Islands where Brent was then loaded directly onto seaborne oil tankers. One of the early challenges that ICE faced trying to grow the trading volumes of this Brent futures contract on our newly acquired exchange was the substantial underlying issue that the Brent oilfields were drying up and oil production was deteriorating. We began working with the oil industry and drove a consensus to allow other grades of oil from locations away from the Brent oilfields to make their way into a newly reconstituted ICE index which we continued to call Brent. Over time, we\u2019ve evolved the index and we\u2019ve added oil from fields of Forties, Oseberg Ekofisk, Troll and most recently, we added US Oil drilled in the Midland basis of West Texas.  The pipeline rail and trucking infrastructure serving the Midland basin drives a large portion of this US oil towards the Gulf of Mexico, where it becomes available for seaborne exports. And the US Oil drillers in this region have been very sensitive to global supply and demand price signals. Their market-based responses have caused their US oil exports to set the marginal price of the ICE Brent index roughly half the time since its latest reconstitution with other global oil grades setting the marginal price for the balance. The Brent oilfield began decommissioning in 2006 and its first drilling platform seized production in 2011, followed by the second and third platforms stopping in 2014 and 2021. The fourth and final Brent platform has been repurposed to tap into another oilfield. So, today, it\u2019s safe to say that there is no longer any Brent in ICE\u2019s Brent index.  During our index evolution ICE marketed the value of the Brent index to the energy industry at the preferred way to hedge global energy prices. US oil exporters are now leveling out the prices for global crude oil and that\u2019s reflected in the Brent index making the difficult geopolitical shock that I just highlighted less impactful on global oil prices. The record volume that ICE sees in our Brent oil futures trading complex is a direct result of this focused evolution of our ICE Brent index. I tell this story as an example of how we think about the industries in which we operate. We invest in and constantly work with market participants to transform industries to reflect changing environments. We are following a similar roadmap with our entire energy complex given the analogous macro backdrop of industrialized economies that are attempting to move away from carbon-emitting fuels causing us to list over a 1,000 commodity contracts versus just four contracts when we acquired the IPE. You may have seen our recent announcement that ICE is working with the US Department of Energy to develop regional markets for hydrogen fuels as we continue to focus on medium to long-term cyclical trends and the next energy frontier. Similarly, by creating our ICE Data Services division nearly nine years ago, we spotted the trend that the single most important asset associated with automation was trusted, mission-critical data and digitized information.  We\u2019ve invested in information acquisition, data dissemination and index construction and you are witnessing our data services division extending the same playbook that we ran on Brent to transform global benchmarks for financial products in areas such as credit and interest rates. And these are increasingly making their way on the platforms around the globe including our own in the form of valuations, reference data, cash markets, derivative markets, ETFs, options and equities.  Importantly, we are leaning into this blueprint to drive ICE\u2019s most recent expansion with a goal to expand participation, facilitate information transparency and spot index creation in the US consumer interest rate markets as we move the industry with the SaaS model on a widely distributed network. A blueprint that captures proprietary data and information that we can organize and disseminate to help our customers make better financial decisions in a world where automation and generative models are key to enabling future efficient workflows. In that vein and shifting to our strong results, 2023 marked our 18th consecutive year of record revenues, record operating income and record adjusted earnings per share, a record every year that we\u2019ve been a public company. This record of growth reflects the quality of our strategy to diversify the business and position the company at the center of some of the largest industries undergoing analog to digital conversions, a strategy that\u2019s made ICE an all weather name which through an array of macroeconomic environments continues to deliver consistent and compounding growth for our stockholders. As we look to 2024 and beyond, we are in a better position than ever to capitalize on secular and cyclical trends that occur across asset classes and we\u2019ve remained focused on investing and executing on many growth opportunities in front of us.  I\u2019d like to conclude these prepared remarks by thanking our customers for their business and for their trust in 2023 and I want to thank my colleagues for their contributions to the best year in our company\u2019s history.  And with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call back to our operator Charlie and we\u2019ll conduct a question and answer session until 9 :30 Eastern Time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Siegenthaler of Bank of America. Craig, your line is open. Please go ahead. Craig Siegenthaler : Hey, good morning, everyone. We wanted a follow-up on the client attrition commentary at Black Knight and the flat recurring revenue target that you provided in the prepared remarks and we are curious where are the clients going and why are they leaving just given your compelling value proposition with both MSP and Encompass under the same book now? Benjamin Jackson : Thanks, Craig. This is Ben. And in terms of attritions that we saw, a couple of our clients that have been subject to mergers and acquisitions. On the same token though, we see a benefit from it. And a couple of obvious examples would be JPMorgan buying First Republic. Those moves \u2013 those loans have moved and are moving on to MSP and then you\u2019ll also have RoundPoint and Two Harbors that have come together and have consolidated their loans on MSP. So when you see that type of M&A activity on the servicing side, it\u2019s been pretty much a net-net. If you look across our overall mortgage segment and just looking at the flat performance that we had last year in terms of recurring revenue and the guide Warren gave this year. Underneath that I think it\u2019s important that we are very confident that based on the sales success and the low attrition that we have had that we are clearly gaining share against both proprietary systems, as well as third-party peers during this tremendous decline in market volumes which in particular is on the origination side of the house. And I\u2019d be \u2013 it\u2019s important to highlight as well that 2023 was a generational low in terms of mortgage transaction volumes. So we went back to data that we see as far back to 1991 to find a year that was as bad and it was actually 1991 that was even close and even that year was better. So to us, markets revert to a mean and if you look at the average from 1991 to 2023, the average is around 10 million loans, the mean was around 8, I think we put a conservative band around that 7 to 10 million loans given the market share gains that we\u2019ve had. The significant customers that we are winning and implementing. We believe this platform is springloaded for growth as we turn the corner. Warren Gardiner : And Craig, I will make that too on the flat guidance for recurring revenue. So on the implementation side, just to reiterate what Ben said that we do have some good visibility into some of the MSP and Encompass sales that are coming online throughout the year and those are the products that are going to really move the needle. On the erosion side, absent of course the one that I mentioned around M&A. Renewals on Encompass and customer engagement, that\u2019s some of the stuff that pressures last year. We still expect some of that, but we\u2019ve seen those trends start to stabilize and actually start to improve in the fourth quarter and into early this year. What I obviously don\u2019t know it\u2019s had visibility into is some of those things like an M&A activity related to our customers. But overall, we feel pretty good about that guide and Ben touched on this too. I think it\u2019s important to really note, well, of course those recurring revenues are important. A lot of these products are also going to have a transaction component to it. And as he noted, we are coming off with the worst year for originations in a generation, but we\u2019ve continue to add new customers, the current customer base is continue to add additional products and we\u2019ve expanded that network. So that when those transactions do normalize, we are going to be really benefiting from that not only on the recurring side, but I think on the transaction side as well. And maybe to help frame that a little bit for you, I think if you were to see industry loan volumes in that $7 million to $10 million loan range, again with $10 million being the average over the last 30 years, we\u2019d see a couple $100 million to nearly $0.5 billion of incremental transaction revenue and that would be a revenue that would be coming at really high incremental margin. So, look, we are focused on investing in the platform, expanding the network, so that we are best positioned for when this market normalizes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Clinch of Redburn Atlantic. Simon, your line is open. Please go ahead. Simon Clinch : Thanks for taking my question. I was sort of interested in how you would frame, I guess, when we look at, could you give us a sense what the market origination market was like in the fourth quarter in terms of unit volume growth? And then ultimately, just how you are thinking about the potential product springloaded recovery? What are the sort of mortgage rate conditions you can \u2013 we need to see that kind of real inflection and acceleration starts compared futures with quota? Thanks. Benjamin Jackson : Thanks, Simon. In terms of composite estimates that are out there, so if you look at the industry bodies that put out industry volume estimates, the market was approximately down 11%, what our modeling shows and if you take a composite of the industry analyst that\u2019s above where it is. I think in terms of couple data points I can share as I said, there is no question in our mind that we are gaining share in terms of against both proprietary platforms and third-party platforms and a lot of those clients because they are significant in size or in the implementation phase. So the benefits we\u2019ll get from recurring revenues will take some time as we implement those clients. The other benefit that we get when those clients are implemented is that those are new loans on our platform that will get per closed transaction fees on and those loans will also interact with hundreds of third-party service providers we have on our network. So when you are ordering a credit report for example, we get a fee for the efficiency that we provide on ordering those services on our networks. So those are additional transaction revenues that we would also benefit from in that case. The other thing that I\u2019d say is that if you look at closed loans on our platform as we look at the closed loans that we saw on our platform were roughly mid-digit percentage points ahead of where the composite estimates are which further is evidence that we are gaining share and springloading this platform for when market volumes stabilize and Warren gave that range of couple hundred million to a half a billion in his comments just a minute ago. So I think that helps to frame when we say that the business is springloaded what that actually means. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Ken, your line is open. Please proceed. Ken Worthington : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow-up on your comments on energy. Maybe first touch gas Hawaii has doubled over the last year. How much of the European gas market is on exchange at this point? And where does this go relative to sort of the OTC market? Where is that balance? And in oil, you called that the share shift to ICE and WTI that seems to coincide into some extent with the reconstitution of Brent, what is driving the share shift to ICE and TI? And how much further do you think there is to shift there? Benjamin Jackson : Hey, Ken. It\u2019s Ben. Thanks for the question. So I\u2019ll start on TTF. So, TTF, a lot of that volume is now on exchange and has transitioned over 10 plus years that we\u2019ve seen that transition happening. I think the next step in the evolution of TTF that we see and I alluded to this in my prepared remarks is that, this is becoming and really has become the global benchmark for natural gas around the world. And it\u2019s being more and more as a proxy for, when you are trading LNG and that\u2019s seeing shifts around the world, which you can underestimate and you follow these markets very closely, you can underestimate the impact of the liberalization of natural gas has had to really creating a global natural gas market. It\u2019s no longer subject to being secular pipeline infrastructure and storages. It can be freely transported around the world. And that is where we are seeing the growth in the TTF contracts and that\u2019s why we constantly point out we are seeing new records, double-digit growth in terms of market participants, significant double-digit growth in terms of data subscriptions in TTF. TTF is up 100% in open interest year-over-year, 45% in ADV this year as more and more clients as they are looking at global issues around the movement of LNG out of the US going into Europe. They need to think about longer term implications of the White House recently announcing pauses on new LNG exports going out. US LNG heading east bound that goes through the Red Sea and Jeff alluded to it in his comments impacts that the attacks in the Red Sea it had on shipping there. US LNG going out of the Gulf going to Asia and when it\u2019s going west bound has to go through the Panama Canal that same unbelievable drought conditions impacting that. These are all risks that people need to manage and it\u2019s the TTF contract that we are now doing that with. So we see a lot of growth in that as that continues to evolve to be a global benchmark similar to what Brent is clearly today.  On WTI, really it goes to the a lot of the investments we have made in the innovation we\u2019ve made in the oil market around that HOU contracts which is Midland WTI basis Houston, a physically delivered contract that we launched a couple of years back that\u2019s been growing significantly, which is pricing WTI oil basis Houston, that\u2019s going into the Atlantic basin and a lot of that being delivered into Europe. People that hedge and trade in those markets are trading those off the cornerstone of Brent are also using our HOU contract and then as a package that also trade WTI and for the efficiencies that they get trading in those Brent markets across those three contracts. We are seeing more and more of that trading volume moving to our exchange. So that\u2019s on the second part of your question around WTI. That\u2019s what we see is driving a lot of that growth in market share. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Budish of Barclays. Ben, your line is open. Please go ahead. Ben Budish : Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to circle back to the Mortgage segment. Just on the cost side, Warren, it sounds like you accelerated some of the cost synergies in 2024. Is there anything more we can read into that in terms of the potentially the total bucket of synergies identified or the pacing of the additional synergies beyond what you see this year? And then, one other question that\u2019s sort of come back along the same lines in terms of not so much cost synergies but perhaps things that ICE could do. Now that you and Black note that that Black Knight was unable to do while the merger was sort of pending. Any update in terms of additional cost reductions that are not quite true M&A synergies but just other things you may be able to do there? Thank you. Benjamin Jackson : Yeah, sure Ben. So, yeah, look, I think it\u2019s a testament to the organization in the sense that we were very well prepared for this deal to close and we really hit the ground running. And so, not only is a testament to the ability for us to kind of get all of our ducks in a row, but also just flexing the muscle that I think we\u2019ve shown over the last number of years that integrations like this it\u2019s definitely a skill set of ours. So, I think to some extent it\u2019s very much a testament to do those two things in terms of us being a little bit better than we initially spoke to when we announced the deal around our Year One synergies. So, look, it does certainly make us feel comfortable about getting to our target of $200 million by the end of year five having coming in as strongly as we are right out of the gates here. But as we move through this year, I think we will take the opportunity to see how that unfolds and if there is any clarity on that and if there is potential to increase those, we\u2019ll certainly let you know. But right now, look we are five months into the same things are going very well and we are really just making progress towards those targets. Warren Gardiner : And Ben, I\u2019ll pick up on that on other things that we are seeing. We\u2019ve mentioned on prior calls things like our proprietary cloud being something that\u2019s \u2013 that we are very proud of in terms of the scalability, the architecture, the operational resiliency, the cyber capabilities that we have there. So we see an opportunity over time to move some of the core technology platforms there to our proprietary cloud and we are planning around that right now and there is a lot of benefits our clients will get from that. Other things that we see is, we are enhancing the MSP platform. So that\u2019s SaaS-based platform that MSP has. We are continuing to enhance this. Leveraging our experience in upgrading technology. The analogy we\u2019ve used in the past, we have to upgrade technology while the cars are driving over the bridge. We have done this time and time again and once business at NYSE and with our ICE Data Services business. So leveraging our expertise is scalable, distributed architecture is all things that we are going to apply towards the enhancements of MSP and making it as efficient of an enhancement as possible. And then the last thing I\u2019d say is, we\u2019ve moved our Black Knight data team. That\u2019s come over, in particular the product team over to our ICE Data Services division and the reason we did that is we think there is going to be two benefits from that. Number one is from the technology side, are there technology capabilities within ICE Data Services or Black Knight that both sides can take advantage of and the early returns are, yes there are. And then number two is our product innovation. There is a number of data sets within Black Knight that are highly applicable to the capital markets space and we believe that with our capital markets expertise within ICE Data Services, there is a lot of new product innovation that we can put out there that will generate benefits both short and medium term. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Brian, your line is open. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just focus on the revenue synergy side in Mortgage tech. I think you said you\u2019ve signed $30 million of the $125 million total so far in just five months and then the $125 million is the five year target that it seems like you are tracking. You are well ahead of that and then maybe just sort of correlating that with the commentary you had a couple of calls on the $300 million of revenue synergy opportunities that you\u2019ve identified. Just trying to see if the $30 million is part of that $300 million? And I guess the broader question is, do you feel like you are also tracking ahead maybe well ahead on the revenue synergy side as you are on the expense review? Warren Gardiner : Thanks, Brian. And you categorize that $300 million that I outlined before. And I think what we are seeing is that the clients one they appreciate and have had a lot of experience working with ICE and our test capabilities have running highly efficient utility type technology infrastructure for them. And that we do this in very efficient ways and we have deep relationships with all of these clients, which I think has really accelerated our ability to hit these revenue synergy targets. And getting ahead of that is quickly as we have only being five months after we\u2019ve done the deal. If you look at the three categories I outlined there, there is one of cross-selling Encompass into roughly 40 of the top 100 MSP clients. And right out of the gates we had a big win there. We mentioned JPMorgan Chase in 2023 that we obviously have big relationships with across all of ICE. And then, in the fourth quarter we added M&T Bank very quickly after we closed. So those are some great examples and that that fit into that first category that take time to implement. The second category is cross-selling MSP into our ICE Mortgage Technology client base. We have thousands and thousands of lenders that are in the ICE Mortgage Technology client base that are leveraging various pieces of technology from us and right out of the gates we had some significant wins in the fourth quarter, Fifth Third Bank, another big super regional bank is in the process of moving to MSPs. That was a great win. I mentioned Black Hills Federal Credit Union in the fourth quarter. They are an ICE Mortgage Technology client as well as Mortgage Solutions of Colorado. And then in my prepared remarks, I also mentioned CapEd Credit Union. So they are an existing Encompass client, as well. So they are adding MSP seeing the addition of us pulling together this complete front to back network.  In the third category, this is expanding our network while cross-selling a lot of our technology platform, ancillary products and data solutions. And here we\u2019ve also seen some great success. So we\u2019ve cross sold a lot of our Black Knight data sets alongside our deal with Fifth Third Bank and MSP. We\u2019ve included our data and document automation platform with the M&T Bank, deal that we closed in the fourth quarter. I think some other areas that we are just now, because we had do some near term integration work that we are just now positioned to start to cross-sell is another important thing to highlight as we \u2013 one of the first things we integrated is we took our Simplifile platform and the incredible network that Simplifile has with all of the local counties around the US and we\u2019ve embedded that network into the, really the back end workflow of MSP, our servicing platform and we are now utilizing that to automate lean releases. So when a loan is paid off on the MSP platform, we can leverage the Simplifile rails to make it highly efficient and effective and very quick to actually effect that lean release which will be additional transaction revenue for us.  I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we\u2019ve integrated our data and document automation platform into MSP. So this is on the front end of the MSP process that we now have our first real integration between Encompass and MSP where we are taking that digital loan file as it\u2019s compiled and can map that now directly into MSP and automate the onboarding of loans. And then we\u2019ve also completed a significant amount of the integration work needed for our proprietary data sets such as closing fees valuations tax and flood and now have the ability to cross-sell all of these data sets that we\u2019ve not had historically a proprietary solution on our Encompass platform. So we can now cross sell that to our client base. So we\u2019ve had a lot of great wins. Those are lot of great successes and update on that, but also some things you will be hearing about more in the future as we are now able to start to distribute these. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Dan, your line is open. Please go ahead. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. Warren, just a question on the balance sheet. I think you said $700 million debt paydown in quarter-over-quarter. That\u2019s probably a bit elevated. But what is a reasonable kind of quarterly pace and as you think about that progress, also do you anticipate being able to buy back stock as you kind of get towards the latter part of this year or early next year? What\u2019s the reasonable timeframe to think about the capital return story improving? Warren Gardiner : Sure. Thanks, Dan. So I think, look, we don\u2019t give sort of forward free cash flow guidance. But we certainly did just report a strong year at $3.2 billion of free cash flow with only about a quarter or so of Black Knight in there. So, that coupled with growth. I think it\u2019s fair to assume that\u2019ll be better than that in 2024 at the end \u2013 as we said, at the moment, our plan is to return the vast majority of that not return I should say, our plan is to use the vast majority of that to pay down the outstanding debt that\u2019s out there today. And so, I think is we are thinking about that in the go forward here. I still think we are on track here as we\u2019ve talked about where we thought for that paydown schedule being sometime in 2025, but depending on forms this could be a little bit earlier in that, as well. So, we are going to have to just sort of see how the year plays out ultimately, but as I said, very much on track to what we thought we\u2019d be and where we would be in terms of our deleveraging phase. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt of KBW. Kyle, your line is open. Please proceed. Kyle Voigt : Hi, good morning. So last year in May, you increased futures transaction fees for the first time in many years. Some of your competitors have announced pricing changes again for 2024. So I just wanted to circle back on how those pricing changes in May were digested by the market. And can you provide some updated thoughts on how you are thinking about pricing across the futures complex at this point and whether anything is planned for 2024? Warren Gardiner : Sure. Kyle, it\u2019s Warren. So, as we said in the past, back in May, you are right, we did increased a couple of contracts across our oil business that something we hadn\u2019t done in a number of years and I\u2019d say it went pretty well. I think you saw the impact \u2013 we see to some extent as we move through the year and obviously the volumes were record levels and continue to be so in January of this year, as well. So I would say that that was \u2013 that went well. As we\u2019ve said to you all in the past, our philosophy is to really look across the platform and look for areas where we have created value and where we can then go capture value. And so we do that every year and we think about it in different ways or utilize it in different ways and as we think about this year what we\u2019ve done within the futures business, we did make some adjustments to the exchange data fees. We\u2019ve done some price adjustments around some of the energy contracts outside of our oil business and then we also made some adjustments on collateral fees at the clearing house which in aggregate actually we are pretty similar to what the impact would have been or was I should say from the changes we made to the oil contracts last year. So, again, we\u2019ve done a similar exercise but executed it in somewhat of a different way and I think that\u2019s part of the opportunity we have going forward as we think about the futures business and ICE probably in terms from a pricing strategy standpoint. Operator : Thank you. This is all the time we have for questions today. So hand back over to Jeff Sprecher, Chair and CEO for any closing remarks. Jeffrey Sprecher : Well, thank you, Charlie for managing the call for us this morning. Before we leave, I wanted to mention that every quarter for the last ten years before and after these earnings announcements, we receive a call and input from a shareholder named Jack Willins. And we didn\u2019t hear from Jack this week. So we did some outreach and learned that he had recently passed at age 88 and I just wanted to acknowledge the fact that his family and friends and colleagues that we also miss hearing from him.  And we are going to go back to work after this call to continue to build this all weather business model and that\u2019s what he would have wanted us to do. And so today, we will do it in his honor. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may all disconnect your lines.",

[Operator Instructions] I will now hand over to Katia Gonzalez, Manager of ICE's Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Katia Gonzalez : Good morning. ICE's first quarter 2024 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of ice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2023 Form 10-K, 2024 first quarter Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the prevailing GAAP terms in our earnings materials. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, references to revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain items. With us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chair and CEO; Warren Gardiner, Chief Financial Officer; Ben Jackson, President; Lynn Martin, President of the NYSE; and Chris Edmonds, President of Fixed Income & Data Services. I'll now turn the call over to Warren. Warren Gardiner : Thanks, Katia. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with a summary of our strong first quarter results. First quarter net revenues totaled a record $2.3 billion. and pro forma for the acquisition of Black Knight, increased by 5% versus last year. First quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $930 million, at the low end of our guidance range, driven by an acceleration of planned expense synergies and a few onetime benefits within compensation costs. Moving to the balance of the year. We expect second quarter adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $945 million to $955 million, with a sequential increase driven in part by a full quarter of merit increases across the organization, planned investments and the modernization of MSP and higher D&A as recent revenue-related data center investments go live. In addition and in part due to synergies being realized sooner than previously expected, we are lowering our full year expense guidance to $3.79 billion to $3.82 billion. This strong first quarter performance helped to drive record adjusted operating income of $1.4 billion, up 8% year-over-year on a pro forma basis and a record earnings per share of $1.48. First quarter free cash flow totaled $877 million, enabling us to reduce debt outstanding by roughly $600 million in the first quarter. Since we completed our acquisition of Black Knight in September,  we've reduced debt by roughly $2 billion. And as a result, adjusted leverage ended the first quarter approximately 3.9x pro forma EBITDA, with first quarter interest expense down $10 million from the fourth quarter. Now let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segments. First quarter net revenues totaled a record $1.2 billion, up 11% year-over-year. Record transaction revenues of $866 million were up 16%, in part driven by a 12% increase in our interest rate business and record energy revenues, which grew 32% year-over-year. This strong performance included a 28% increase in our oil complex, 42% growth in global natural gas revenues driven by another record-setting quarter for TTF, and 26% growth in our environmental business. In addition, as of the end of April, open interest is up 23% year-over-year, including 22% growth in our global commodities and 25% growth in our energy markets. Shifting to recurring revenues, which include our Exchange data services and our NYC Listings business, revenue totaled $357 million in the first quarter. Similar to last quarter, growth in the number of customers consuming our global energy and environmental data was partially offset by the rolling off of initial listing fees related to the strong IPO market in 2021 and lower exchange data revenue at the NYSE. It's worth noting that the IPO market has shown signs of improvement so far in 2024, with the NYSE capturing nearly 70% of total proceeds raised and welcoming 6 of the top 7 IPOs year-to-date, despite more than 50% of new listings not meeting our gold standard of qualification criteria. Turning now to Slide 6. I'll discuss our Fixed Income & Data Services segment. First quarter revenues totaled a record $568 million. Transaction revenues of $119 million were driven by growth in corporate bond trading, which was in part driven by strong growth within our institutional channel. This is offset by lower treasury and CD volumes as well as lower levels of CDS clearing activity. Record recurring revenues totaled $449 million and grew by 4% year-over-year. In our fixed income and data analytics business, record first quarter revenues of $288 million increased by 4%. Growth was once again driven by improving trends in our PRD business and another quarter of double-digit growth in our index business. Importantly, fixed income data and analytics ASV, or annual subscription value, improved from the 2% range experienced through much of 2023 to 4% exiting the first quarter as we continue to see customer reengagement and investment across the fixed income ecosystem. Other Data & Network Services grew 4% in the first quarter, driven by our feeds business and continued strength in our oil and gas desktop solutions, both of which grew double digits year-over-year. Importantly, demand for our connectivity solutions remains strong with the backlog of signatures related to our ICE Global Network offering expected to come online and into both ASV and revenue in early July following the build-out of additional data center capacity. As a result, we expect second quarter year-over-year growth in overall recurring revenue to be similar to the first quarter, with year-over-year growth improving in the second half, driven by continued strong trends across fixed income data and analytics, and an acceleration in growth in our other data and network services businesses. Please flip to Slide 7, where I will discuss the results in our Mortgage Technology segment. Please note that my comments are on a pro forma basis. ICE Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $499 million in the first quarter. Recurring revenues totaled $390 billion (sic) [$390 million]. As we noted last quarter, recurring revenues were impacted by both industry consolidation and continued pressure on renewals within our origination technology business. It's worth noting that while current macro conditions are putting pressure on minimums at renewal, and thus, our recurring revenues, customers are overwhelmingly remaining on our platform. And while yet to manifest in our results, lower minimums upon renewal are paired with a higher price per transaction, a dynamic that will provide an incremental tailwind when industry volumes normalize. Said differently, total contract value in a normal market is on average increasing upon renewal. Transaction revenues totaled $109 million in the first quarter. While closed loans increased slightly, this was offset by lower professional services fees and lower default management revenues within our servicing business. Importantly, as I previously indicated, we have realized expense synergies faster than originally anticipated, which, when coupled with a relatively stable top line on a year-over-year basis, has helped to drive an 8% increase in segment operating income. Looking to the full year and after factoring in the dramatic shift in interest rate expectations for 2024 relative to just 3 months ago, we now expect total revenue growth in our Mortgage Technology business to be flat to down in the low single-digit range, with revenues unlikely to improve materially from the first quarter levels until the second half. The high end of the range is underpinned by a flat-to-modest improvement in industry origination volumes or the lower end of the range anticipates a more conservative decline in the mid- to high single-digit range relative to 2023. Despite these macro pressures, we continue to invest in product development and enhancement. We continue to expand our existing network and we are executing on our synergy targets, all of which further position our platform to realize accelerating growth when market conditions normalize. In summary, we delivered another very strong start to the year. We once again delivered strong revenue, operating income, free cash flow and adjusted earnings per share growth. And we continue to invest across our business to meet both the needs of our customers and to position our business to continue to deliver consistent and compounding growth for our stockholders into the future. I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll hand it over to Ben. Benjamin Jackson : Thank you, Warren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 8. Our customers continue to rely on our leading technology, mission-critical data and transparent and accessible markets to navigate uncertainty while managing risk. Across our global Futures and Options business, total average daily volumes increased 16% to a record 8.1 million lots in the first quarter, including records across commodities, energy and total options. This strong performance drove record futures and options revenues, with energy revenues nearly tripling since the same period in 2010 and growing double digits on average over that time frame. And through April, open interest across our global commodities and energy markets remains at all-time highs, up 22% and 25%, respectively, versus last year. A direct benefit from the long tail of secular growth trends unfolding across global oil, natural gas and environmental markets. A number of years ago, we recognized the importance of investing in an energy platform that is truly global, one that better serves the needs of an evolving and growing commercial customer base. Today, as a result of organic and inorganic investments, trading on our network is not tied to any single product or limited to any one region. Instead, we have built a diversified energy network, delivering comprehensive risk management solutions, providing capital efficiencies and positioned to grow alongside the continued evolution of global markets. In our oil markets, as trade dynamics evolve and become increasingly complex, customers seek not only liquidity in the global -- major global benchmarks, but also in products that provide for greater hedging precision. Reflecting this dynamic, our other crude and refined products continue to set records with ADV growing double digits on average over the past 5 years. This portfolio increased 47% year-over-year in the first quarter alone, while open interest is up 27% through the end of April. In the more than 20 years that ICE has been building its global energy platform, we have created hundreds of precise hedging instruments, driven by collaboration with our customers. All of these instruments are underpinned by the deep liquidity in our benchmarks such as Brent. In March 2021, in partnership with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company and 9 of the world's largest energy traders as founding partners, we launched ICE Futures Abu Dhabi, or IFAD. This new exchange enabled for the first time, market participants to come together and contribute to the price formation of a new innovation, the Murban Futures contract, an important benchmark for oil flowing to Asia. In the first quarter, as IFAD marked its third anniversary, our Murban Futures reached new highs, surpassing over 1 million contracts traded along with a series of open interest records in April. Similarly, our Platts Dubai contract had another quarter of record volumes, increasing 58% year-over-year. Another innovation that we launched 2 years ago, the Midland WTI contract known as HOU, is a deliverable crude grade of Midland oil based in Houston. This contract is fast becoming the most accurate representation of the Houston oil market as evidenced by HOU reaching record volumes during the quarter. Further supporting the growth of this new risk management innovation is that this oil has been added into the ICE Brent basket, which creates new opportunities for clients to manage risk by hedging with this contract. Collectively, this strong performance drove another quarter of record oil revenues, up 28% year-over-year. In our natural gas markets, the globalization of gas and the rise of LNG are secular trends we began investing in over a decade ago, beginning with our index investment, an investment that has established us as a leader in European gas trading. Today, with Asia as the largest buyer of global LNG, the relationship between our European TTF and Asian JKM benchmarks drives global price formation. In the first quarter, the number of market participants in each market grew double digits versus last year, with both reaching record volumes. This strong performance drove record natural gas revenues, up 42% year-over-year in the first quarter. Importantly, open interest trends for TTF and JKM remained strong through April, up 90% and 50% year-over-year, respectively. The globalization of natural gas alongside a global focus on decarbonization is critical to environmental markets, built off of our acquisition of the Climate Exchange more than a decade ago, we operate the world's largest and most liquid environmental markets. Here, we have seen the number of active market participants grow double digits on average over the past 5 years, including record participation in the first quarter. At the same time, ADV across our environmental portfolio increased 22% year-over-year, with open interest up 27% through the end of April. Price transparency across the energy spectrum is critical as companies look to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective manner. By combining the network and liquidity of our global energy platform with our leading environmental portfolio, we are well positioned to help our customers navigate this transition across global energy markets. In summary, the evolution of our energy markets is one example of how we continuously invest and develop customer-driven solutions across asset classes, as well as the creative approach we've taken to leverage our infrastructure, technology and expertise to drive value creation. Our record performance is a product of these investments, some that we've made more than a decade ago, and our commitment to staying close to our customers, an approach that permeates this organization, helping to drive effective and efficient product innovation. This approach is also important to our data business, where we are uniquely positioned to leverage our distribution and our infrastructure to create new content and to expand the breadth of our offering. Our position as a leading provider of price and reference data have served as the foundation for what is today one of the largest providers of fixed income indices globally. The accelerating growth of passive investing and the efforts we've made to increase the breadth of our offering, and the flexibility of our approach to index construction, has contributed to the double-digit average annual growth in our index business since we acquired the Bank of America Merrill Lynch franchise in 2017. A key driver of this growth is the increase in the passive ETF assets under management benchmarked to our indices, growing to a record of $593 billion through the end of the first quarter from less than $100 billion in 2017. While critical, our pricing data and index businesses are only components of what we offer to this growing industry. As a leading provider of such proprietary data services, we have developed deep expertise in gathering and cleansing unstructured data, skills in building the database that serves as the foundation for developing actionable insights and identifying opportunities not only in the fixed income markets, but across many other asset classes. This is an expertise we're starting to leverage across a number of mortgage data initiatives. For example, in April, we announced the integration of our property and loan-level mortgage data sets with our property-level climate risk metrics covering more than 100 million U.S. homes. This integration improves transparency and facilitates risk management throughout the housing finance and property insurance sector, allowing customers to apply ICE's climate metrics to individual loans, properties and entire portfolios, improving the visibility to the inherent climate risks in each. In addition, we are leveraging these insights to enhance asset-level climate risk modeling for existing municipal bonds and mortgage-backed securities products. As we move forward, there is significant opportunity to continue to expand and evolve the products and services within our Fixed Income & Data Services business. Turning now to our mortgage business. Following the proven playbook we've applied across our global energy and fixed income businesses, in mortgages, we are leveraging market-leading technology, mission-critical data and our network expertise to build innovative solutions that improve workflow efficiencies. With a touch point to nearly every market participant, we have connectivity to a customer base in need of the automation that our digital solutions provide. In this regard, we're pleased to share that we closed 20 new Encompass clients in the first quarter. Building on the wins we announced last year with banks such as M&T and JPMorgan Chase and the announcement earlier this year of adding Fifth Third Bank to Encompass on top of their move to MSP announced late last year, we are pleased to now announce that Citizens Bank and Webster Bank, both existing MSP clients, are moving to Encompass. Just like many of the other recent wins that we are implementing, these clients see the significant value that we can provide through our complete front-to-back offering. For MSP, building on the capital mortgage solutions of Texas and CapEd Credit Union wins mentioned on the last call, we closed Lennar, a long-time Encompass client. Our growing customer relationships serve as a validation of our vision, bringing together a complete front-to-back experience for our customers and their clients through one trusted platform. Our clients seek a solution provider that supports digital workflows throughout the home-ownership life cycle, starting with matching a consumer to the right lending product at the right time on the loan origination, closing, servicing in the capital markets. This is directly in line with our long-term vision and the journey we have been on. Importantly, we remain focused on executing on our strategy of relieving the pain points and inefficiencies that exist across the mortgage workflow, and remain committed to investing behind secular growth while enhancing the value proposition of our network. For example, we have completed the evolution of Encompass to a new web user experience, with new automation tools and more ways to partner and extend the platform to serve our customers' business needs. In parallel, we're executing on our investment commitments to continue to advance our market-leading MSP servicing platform. A perfect example of this execution is the recently announced rollout of our MSP Digital Experience, or MSP DX. This service is an intuitive and conversational new interface, leveraging natural language processing for our servicing system designed to streamline workflows, increase efficiencies and expedite training of new servicing personnel. Along the same lines, we've completed our first integration of Encompass to MSP. This integration leverages our data and document automation platform, and our neural network large language model for the classification and extraction of data from documents to automate loan onboarding from Encompass straight to MSP, reducing errors and providing significant efficiencies to clients that have our front-to-back solution set. Simultaneously, we've been integrating our tax, flood and closing fees into Encompass, providing lenders more choice in service providers for these important underwriting data assets. In summary, as we move through 2024 and beyond, we are excited about the many opportunities for growth that lie ahead. Opportunities that we're able to capture because of the investments we've made in the past and the strategic investments we will continue to make across our networks into the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey Sprecher : Thank you, Ben. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Please turn to Slide 9. We are increasingly being asked how ICE is incorporating artificial intelligence into our business. So while I'm not here to discuss the financial impact, I thought I'd touch on some of the AI investments across ICE. Like many large corporations, we have developers working on how to integrate AI models into our products, on how we better contract for and monetize our proprietary data sets and on how we improve our own productivity. Along those lines, we created an internal R&D group that we're calling our AI Center of Excellence, where we're testing novel use cases and working to build appropriate governance card guardrails to reduce or eliminate the risks inherent to AI. We are focused on getting it right, while working towards a goal of bringing AI-enabled enhancements and new products to our customers. Ben just spoke about investing in our mortgage data and document automation product, which is an extension of the product formerly called AIQ that we acquired with Ellie Mae. We've also mentioned investing in our commodity chat platform called, ICE Chat, to improve upon actionable insights and market data. And we've commented on our work using artificial intelligence models for pattern recognition in our regulatory compliance activities. Today, I'd like to further speak to some of the lesser-known, second-order impacts of the market's current energetic focus on AI that we see feeding growth to ICE. If you think back to the start of ICE, the prevalent financial exchanges were largely open outcry venues, and both listed and over-the-counter trading involve significant involvement of human intermediaries. Our thesis of using digital networks to connect people and broaden access to risk management pushed us to create and manage our own data centers and network channels. Today, we operate from 14 global data centers, and we've built out the ICE Cloud, a managed network, connecting our data centers to many third-party trading and data venues, and interconnecting major players across the global financial services industry. We've made the determination that managing our own IT infrastructure and making it available to our customers directly and through an ICE-managed cloud offers us a competitive advantage while providing for better intellectual property protection and creating an avenue for our connectivity and data revenue growth. One service that we offer our customers is the ability to utilize their code and equipment within the ICE global network and transmit the digital output across the ICE-managed cloud. This ICE strategy has resulted in requests from customers to incorporate their AI models inside our network, and it's driving increasing demand for ICE Data Center and ICE Cloud access. We've already received customer deposits for much of our planned year 2025 and year 2026 network build-outs, and we've been working with our vendors to plan for its continued expansion. This customer interest in artificial intelligence modeling should provide a multiyear tailwind to revenue growth in our data and connectivity business. Another second-order revenue impact from the current interest in AI is the attention that our listed emissions offset markets and our listed renewable energy markets are receiving from power companies and third-party data center developers as they plan for their future growth, given that ICE is a major host of the world's tradable emission and renewable energy markets. Our subsidiary, ICE Benchmark Administration, which administers regulated benchmarks, manages our carbon market data service that provides validated data to companies seeking information about the voluntary markets for carbon credits. Interest in these markets is surging as evidenced by corporate involvement more than doubling over the past 6 months to more than 250 firms. And last month, the United Nations Science-based Target Initiative, the world's main verifier of emissions targets, said that it will permit the use of emission offset credits to count towards reducing emissions against Scope 3 targets. Coupled with the European Commission's aim to increase its emissions reductions beginning in 2024, plus the EU's inclusion of new industrial sectors that will be subject to these targets, we believe the backdrop for revenue growth in ICE's environmental and renewable markets attributable to AI model demand remains bright. Shifting now to our strong results. In the first quarter, we once again grew revenues, grew adjusted operating income and grew adjusted earnings per share, yet again delivering the best quarter in our company's history. Our consistent results are a testament to the value of our mission-critical data, leading market technology and the strength of our strategic business model. ICE is a company that has deliberately grown through curated acquisition and entrepreneurship. We have targeted an interrelated collection of markets to help our customers manage risk due to both acts of nature and acts of man. Typically, we think of our global commodity-oriented businesses is being levered to acts of nature, such as issues that affect supply chain flows. And we think of our global financially oriented risk management businesses as being levered to acts of man, such as Central Bank and cross-border trade policies. We purposely have targeted providing a mix of these businesses to find growth somewhere in the world in varying underlying conditions. And we have intentionally positioned our company to provide customer solutions to facilitate all-weather results, such as those we are reporting for this record quarter. I'd like to end my prepared remarks by thanking our customers for their continued business and for their trust. And I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contributions to our best-ever quarterly results. And with that, I'll now turn the call back to our moderator, Emily, and we'll conduct a question-and-answer session until 9 :30 a.m. Eastern Time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Kenneth Worthington : I wanted to dig a bit more into the globalization of gas. So a couple of questions here. OI is surging in TTF. Volume growth remains very strong. How far along is this period of rapid growth for TTF? And is it really being driven by the globalization of gas? Or is there something else driving this most recent surge? And then can you address the extent to which the Biden administration pause of LNG export licenses could impact the globalization of gas? It feels like a speed bump along the way, but does a Republican president change the equation? Benjamin Jackson : Ken, it's Ben. Thanks for the question. And I'll take the first part of your question first, and then I'll hit the second part. In terms of natural gas, we believe that TTF is a long, long runway to go. And what really fundamentally changed is that natural gas has been liberalized. It's no longer wedded to just pipeline flows, and it can now move freely around the world in the form of LNG. And there have been massive investments in LNG terminals and regasification terminals around the world that have really changed and evolved gas into a global commodity, and TTF has emerged as the global way to hedge that risk. And if you look at all the risks around the world right now and across Europe and the U.S., we believe that you need to have not only benchmark products, but you also have to have products that enable people to manage risk at more precise hedging locations as well in parallel to products like TTF. I mean, right now, you look at the dynamics, the European gas markets have recovered to some degree, with U.S. LNG now flowing into Europe. You've got regasification terminals that have come online in Germany and the Netherlands that have helped. Storage has been at high levels this past winter. We had a mild winter in Europe. But you still have a backdrop of geopolitical risks that introduced tail risk and ongoing risk to energy supply that are going to continue to evolve supply chains around the natural gas market. And now that gas can move freely, we think there's going to be a tremendous amount of opportunities for clients to use our products to hedge all of those risks, the confluence of those risks and as those things change and evolve. And as you pointed out, TTF has had a tremendous runway here. Our open interest is up 90% year-over-year and volumes are up 60%. In terms of the White House pausing on new permits for LNG exporters from the U.S., we see this as just another speed bump, you used the right word, along the way, that market participants have to look at and determine what risk does this introduce to me. It takes years for this to have an impact. Permits that are in place now, take years to come online. So it's more of a longer-term implication for the market to absorb. But on the same token, you have a new LNG terminal coming online in Canada soon. So you're going to continue to see LNG as it's been liberalized move around the world. That risk needs to be managed, and TTF is the fundamental place that it's done. Operator : Our next question comes from Benjamin Budish with Barclays. Benjamin Budish : I was wondering if you could touch on the IMT revised guidance. To what extent is your view on the transaction-based opportunity dependent on -- or based on changes in the MBA forecast? Or Warren, I think you mentioned the change in the interest rate outlook over the course of the year. How much is that -- are those two pieces sort of impacting what that business could look like the supply and demand for house versus interest rates making the environment less affordable? And then on the recurring revenue side, it sounds like negotiations are a little bit tougher in terms of minimum contract levels. Any commentary on the overall health of the customer base? It sounds like churn is quite low, but any other color there would be helpful. Warren Gardiner : Sure, Ben. Let me start on that transaction. I'm going to turn it to Ben to give you some color more on what's going on with the customer front. So yes, you're correct. I mean when we thought about guidance last quarter and we gave you that guidance, the high end of that range really was taking in what some of the forecasters were giving you in terms of what they thought the year was going to look like. And we wanted to build in towards the lower end of that range, a little bit more of a conservative outlook.  You've seen that they brought those down as well, and that actually now -- so that same framework was how we were thinking about this as we revised guidance this quarter because we've now taken it down sort of similar -- at least at the high end towards where they're sitting at the moment and that we wanted to put a little bit more of a conservative bent on it towards the lower end of that range as we move forward. There's obviously a lot of uncertainty around what the trajectory of interest rates and, therefore, mortgage bonds are going to look like as we move through the balance of the year. And so that was how we were thinking about it from an origination standpoint and just the macro impact that, that has on the customer base as they think about making decisions and things of that nature. Benjamin Jackson : Ben, I'll follow up on the second part of your question there. We have 100% conviction on the ability for this business to grow over the long term. And we continued quarter-over-quarter to just give more and more evidence to the fact with just customer wins that are coming on board. So we feel great that even in this volume environment, that is an environment that hasn't been seen almost in a generation since 1991, that we're continuing to bring customers onto our platform into our ecosystem and continuing to gain in that area.  A couple of things. Obviously, in this past quarter, the industry shifted from a rate cut expectation of 5 to 6 cuts in 2024 to what seems like now is 1, maybe 2, and this happened rapidly. So we're watching and monitoring what's happening with our clients as a result of that. The couple of things I'd point out. Customers are renewing and renewing at very high levels. On the renewal front, we're seeing almost a repeat of what we've seen and what I've talked about in several quarters now that the majority of our customers are renewing and they're renewing at higher minimums, higher subscription levels. But we are seeing some percentage of those customers that are choosing to renew with lower minimums, lower subscriptions. But the trade-off there is consistently a higher foreclosed loan fee. And our objective on all of these renewals, which we're achieving, is to increase the total contract value that these customers are, regardless of which way that go in that negotiation based on the value that we're continuing to provide with all the new innovation that we're introducing into the marketplace. So in terms of renewals, we're not really seeing a significant change. On the sales front, we continue to have great sales success. I just mentioned several new wins on top of other wins that we've announced recently with Citizens Bank and Webster Bank. So we feel good about the funnel. What's unknown and what we're just watching closely is that just given how fast rate expectations changed, a lot of our market participants want market stability and want a view as to when they're going to get return on investments. So we're watching closely to see our sales cycles going to potentially lengthen. But for the most part, we are seeing customers continuing to take this time while the tide is out to invest in this critical infrastructure, so that when the tide comes back in, they're well-positioned to capitalize on them. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Moley with Piper Sandler. Patrick Moley : I was hoping that you could just provide an overview or a progress update on your efforts to build out institutional connectivity in the Fixed Income & Data Services business. And then secondly, can you help us understand the institutional opportunity there and your strategy just from an inorganic and organic standpoint? Lynn Martin : This is Lynn Martin. Thanks so much for the question. So we are incredibly excited at the opportunity to continue to build out the institutional connectivity across our Fixed Income & Data Services segment. Now part of the reason why we're so excited is because we have seen the adoption on the institutional side in our muni execution business, in particular, continued to grow with a CAGR over the last 2 years. And because of the way we have deliberately curated our data assets, we think there is still room to continue to grow given the success we've had with institutional adoption, particularly in our index business. Our index business, as Ben mentioned earlier in his prepared remarks, is now at a record roughly $600 billion in AUM that benchmarks against our index business. Going to turn it to my colleague, Chris, to give you some more color on the progress he's made since he stepped into the role. Christopher Edmonds : Yes. Thanks, Lynn. And Patrick, thanks for the question. What I've seen from being in the role since January 1, is this opportunity on the execution side for us to draw closer what we're seeing in the development of SMA or separate managed accounts to the institutional trading that's going on there. There's a deep desire across the street that get closer to those 2 pools of liquidity, and we're uniquely positioned to provide that opportunity. And as Lynn mentioned, bringing the data, so everyone is looking at exactly the same marks and valuations for those transaction values has been an important way for us to step up to the plate and provide that solution that is unique across the street and available to us and our clients. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Daniel Fannon : I wanted to follow up on mortgage. You guys obviously are having a lot of success in signing up large financial institutions over the last several quarters. How do we think about the on-ramp and the revenue contribution of some of these larger firms? And is -- and also separately on the servicing side, there was some declines both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. And I wanted to understand why the recurring portion of some of that business that's legacy Black Knight is also under a bit of pressure. Benjamin Jackson : Thanks, Dan. It's Ben. In terms of these large clients that we've signed, it does take time to implement them. These systems are core to their operations. There's a high amount of compliance that's managed through these applications. So it takes time to bed them down in highly regulated companies. So it is going to take time for those to flow through. But many of them, as they -- as we've been announcing a lot of these wins through last year, is going to start playing out towards the latter part of this year. And into next year, you'll start seeing contribution of those. On the servicing side, the servicing business is doing very well. From our perspective, we -- and we mentioned it on last call, there has been some industry consolidation that did impact a little bit in Q1. You do have MSRs, mortgage servicing rights, that do switch at times between subservicers, some that are on MSP and some that are not on MSP. And we saw some of that again in Q1, but the net effect is it basically nets out. One change we did see was -- in this past quarter was we did see an acceleration from one of the large depositories that's been very public about wanting to sell some of what they saw as their nonstrategic MSRs that came through their correspondent channel. So we saw an acceleration of that. We see that as a temporary thing. But overall, on MSP, we have a record number of clients that are on MSP with 94 clients, and we have 13 clients that are going through implementation. Many of these are ones that we've announced since we closed on Black Knight and have they really accelerated the ability to pick up a lot of these clients. The second thing I'd point out is that on the servicing side, I'm really pleased with our execution in terms of modernizing that technology stack. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the new natural language processing-based platform and MSP DX, so the whole interface that the clients use to interface that with the servicing system has been overhauled already. As I mentioned on our prior call, we've embedded the Simplifile platform into the back end of MSP to automate the process of releasing liens, so really unique position we are in to automate that with the platform that we have in Simplifile. We've -- as mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've integrated Encompass to MSP, leveraging our data and document automation platform. And the last thing I'd point out is a lot of these Encompass wins that I keep mentioning are clients that are on MSP. Webster and Citizens Bank are 2 perfect examples, where they're on MSP and the clients see the efficiency and the vision -- the efficiency that we provide and the vision of where we're going is really helping us pull through Encompass wins. So we feel great about the positioning of it. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Allen with Citi. Christopher Allen : I wanted to dig in a little bit more on the Fixed Income business. I believe you noted in the prepared remarks investments by clients in the business. So maybe some color there. And I believe you -- with the new leadership in the business, you were taking efforts to kind of reinvigorate the sales process. Just wondering where you are with that. Do you think you're fully up to speed and have improved the kind of the sales and retention focus that you've spoken to before? Christopher Edmonds : It's Chris. I -- what I would say, I've seen since taking on the role is two really things, one macro and one, I think, related to us. Certainly, there's a focus on the client base to find the most comprehensive solution set that's available, and they're looking for opportunities around there to tie that into single or very few vendors to provide that. And we also made a change in how we have service to clients since January. And so we moved to a different structure within the team itself, and I'm very proud of the team and the results they produced from that because they're much closer to the client these days. And those two things come together, we've seen a shortened sales cycle on some of the products that we have historically had great success with. We've also seen a much more robust discussion on future strategic plans on the client base. So I think we're well positioned going into the rest of the year to bring that to bear. Lynn Martin : And then just to follow that up, this is Lynn. On the macro side, we've seen a reengagement on the fixed income fund side of the business with the amount of fixed income funds having increased by about 7% versus the prior year, which again, makes us incredibly well positioned given the suite of assets that we have, both on the end of day pricing, the reference data, the years of history there, plus on the more modern tools that we have rolled out to the market, like CEP, where we see continued strong adoption and continued strong demand. And then obviously, the fixed income index business that I referenced earlier in my comments. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Craig Siegenthaler : Our question is on the acceleration in ASV in the fixed income business. We're curious which channels are driving upside to wins? Has there been any noticeable changes in attrition? And how will this translate into future revenue growth? Warren Gardiner : Craig, it's Warren. So I think Chris and Lynn just covered kind of what we were seeing on the customer front, and that's a big part of why you're seeing that pickup in ASV in the Fixed Income & Data and Analytics business. So -- and so we've seen pretty stable retention trends. We're seeing an improvement in the sales cycle. We're seeing, as I said in my prepared remarks, more of a reengagement from the customer base within the fixed income ecosystem around those products, whether it's the pricing and reference data business or the index business. And that's really a big reason of why we're seeing the improvement there. And it's really -- as we spoke to you guys throughout the course of last year, we were having some pressures on that business. We mentioned that it was because we had a really sharp move on higher in interest rates. There was sort of a period of time there where customers were sitting on their hands trying to -- sort of licking their wounds, if you will, in a way. And now that we've seen somewhat of a stabilization here at these kinds of interest rates, fixed income becomes a fairly attractive asset class. And I think that's a lot of the reason you're seeing that reengagement, you're seeing some growth, you're seeing index purchases, things of that nature, that's really starting to help that business pick up versus where it was a couple of quarters ago. Operator : The next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Kyle Voigt : Maybe just on the Exchange segment. I think the recurring revenues there were flat, and I think only 1% growth on the data and connectivity side. I guess are you still expecting low single-digit growth in recurring fees for the full year in that segment. And then if so, is that dependent on the IPO environment opening up further? Or would you expect some acceleration in the data and connectivity line into the back half of the year and that could still drive full-year growth into that low single-digit range? Warren Gardiner : It's Warren. So yes, we still expect that to be in the low single-digit range. Really, what happened this quarter, I mentioned a little bit in my prepared remarks with more on the New York Stock Exchange data side, where in the prior year we had -- the administrator takes kind of overbilled people and our allocation was a little bit higher, and so we had to reverse some of that in the first quarter. You'll see revenue in the second quarter pick back up as that kind of is no longer the case for us. And so I think you start to see a little bit better growth as we kind of move to the balance of the year within that segment because the underlying trends there are still the same as what we've been seeing in the last couple of quarters. Certainly, on the exchange data side, things are positive. We're seeing some momentum in listings for sure. But at the same time, there is M&A. There is still an element of delisting on the stack side that's weighing a little bit. So to get to that low single-digit, I don't think you necessarily need to see a big acceleration in listings. But certainly, we are seeing some positive things that I think are encouraging on that front. And I think the trends on the Exchange data side, particularly on the Futures side, I think we'll continue to be strong through the balance of the year. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Maybe just a two-parter on mortgage for Warren and Ben, just on the guidance for the segment. Maybe just your view on the trend of recurring revenue throughout the year as we progress sequentially each quarter. Just generally the trend, given the pullback in some of the renewals, the Black Knight servicing headwinds, contrasted with, and this links into probably, Ben, but contrasted with the really good progress you're making on the new business wins. And then if you could update us on the -- I think you were at $30 million out of the $125 million revenue synergy goal at the end of fourth quarter, if you could update that number on a run rate basis. Warren Gardiner : That sounds like three questions, Brian. I'll take 1 and 3, then Ben will take 2. So I think towards the higher end of that of the total -- of the range for total revenue, where we're talking about originations down more in the higher single-digit, mid- to high single-digit range versus 2023, which was also, by the way, the worst year for originations in probably about 30 years, I think you'd expect recurring revenues to be down a little bit year-over-year. I mean renewals will come in a little bit -- will be under a little bit of pressure, continue to be under a little bit of pressure. I would imagine decisions get pushed out a little bit, things of that nature.  Towards the higher end, I think flat to maybe potentially a little bit softer versus last year's there and really for the same reasons, but is not really to the same magnitude that would see probably in the higher single-digit range, if you will on that front. So look, I think importantly, through all of this and what's kind of driving some of this, is just uncertainty across this asset class and certainly across a number of asset classes. And that uncertainty is helping to propel a lot of growth in other areas of our business. We've seen some better trends in both bonds. We've seen better trends in CDS in April. Obviously, our Futures business is doing really well. And so this mortgage is part of a bigger and broader business that has proven to continue to compound through a lot of different environments. And I think that will continue to be the case despite what is kind of a really a generational low in industry origination volumes for the mortgage market at the moment. Quickly on -- just on the revenue synergies, we continue to make progress there. As we said, we're sort of around that $30 million or so range last quarter. We continue to make progress on that front. We'll give you guys more of an update as we kind of move into -- closer to next year though. Benjamin Jackson : And I'll pick up on some of the comments that I made earlier around sales. So we continue to have great sales success. We're really happy with the success that we're having with our clients and the fact that even this environment, and I use the analogy, when the tides are out, we're so pleased to see that clients right now are making investments at this point in time to be able to better position that when the tide comes in and when volumes start to return that they don't have to just throw bodies to the business in a very inefficient way that they can actually leverage technology and automation that we're providing to help them grow. So we're very pleased in what we're seeing there. We're actually using it as also, Brian, as an opportunity to help our clients. So I'll give you an example. In our D&A business, we had some noise in our D&A line this past quarter, where we had some clients that were legacy clients of our data and document automation platform that were not on Encompass, and they were struggling in terms of volumes and in this environment. We took it as an opportunity to restructure their agreement to, in some cases, get them onto Encompass coupled with DDA so that they can get the full value that, that combined solution provides by having the loans originated on Encompass and then the automation capabilities to flow straight through, because we have wedded that DDA platform directly into the Encompass platform. So we're using it as an opportunity, that even though we now have to implement that client, it's going to take time to get them implemented. From a strategic perspective, we're in a much better situation with that client to continue to grow with them and provide value to that client going forward. And that example is specifically Citizens Bank, as they're now on Encompass, they have the DDA platform and they have MSP as a complete front-to-back solution set for them. So we're using it as an opportunity for clients as well. Operator : The next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein : I wanted to pivot a little bit, maybe focus on the energy markets for a couple of minutes. And specifically just zoning in on oil. Now volatility has been a little bit more conducive to the environment here. But it looks like the open interest has been growing really nicely north of 20% or so year-over-year. So a couple of questions here. I guess, what is driving, I guess, the accelerated growth in oil for you guys across the board? It's not just brand and WTI, but it seems a little bit broader. And then how do you think about the sort of the structural versus cyclical benefits in that market? Are we in a kind of higher run rate growth from here? And if so, why? And maybe you can just expand out sort of the sources of growth there. Benjamin Jackson : Thanks, Alex. It's Ben. And for us, we see it as a long-term growth trend for us, to answer the tail end of that question that you asked there because in our view, the trends within energy broadly as well as within oil specifically, are still that there's been underinvestment in legacy energy infrastructure. The markets are still electronifying. The market wants the efficiency that can be provided by the electronification. You have energy markets that are more global. Supply chains are continuing to evolve. Clients want more precision in their ability to manage risk at the point of production and consumption. And the world is moving more green. So you have that confluence of issues. And we've been managing our portfolio across energy as a portfolio that helps to solve all of those problems. So we've built deep liquid products across our gas business, hundreds of locations and benchmark products within our gas business. We've done the same exact thing within our oil business, and we've done the same thing in our environmental business. So there's a relationship between all of those that we think is strong and you can't discount that as an underlying thing that's growing our overall complex because customers want to manage all this risk in one place. So we continue to be very well positioned. You have Brent as the cornerstone of this business. I went through in my prepared remarks, and we've talked about a lot of the innovation that we've introduced to this market over the last 3 years with our Murban contract growing significantly, with our HOU contract which now has Midland WTI oil basis, Houston flowing into the Brent contract, we are so well positioned across that complex to grow as our clients need the precision of these risk management tools that it's fantastic for us. And even in oil, I'd point out that we've been, from an environmental perspective, investing in new contracts like our RINs contracts, renewable identification numbers, as the EPA continues to raise the number of -- the amount of renewable fuels that needs to be blended into gasoline. And that used to be a very much an OTC opaque market. And we've introduced futures into that, and it's been growing very nicely for us as well. So we continue to innovate in this space, not only within oil, but I think it's important to look at it in the broader context of our energy business. Operator : We have no further questions, so I hand back to Jeff Sprecher, CEO, for closing remarks. Jeffrey Sprecher : Well, thank you, Emily. Thanks all for joining us this morning, and I want to thank my colleagues again for a record first quarter and our customers for their continued business and trust. And we look forward to updating you again soon as we continue to try to innovate and build out this all-weather business model. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. This concludes our call, and you may now disconnect your lines.",

During today's call, there will be a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Katia Gonzalez, Manager of Investor Relations to begin. Please go ahead. Katia Gonzalez : Good morning. ICE's second quarter 2024 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section on the ice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2023 Form 10-K, 2024 second quarter Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe our non-GAAP measures are reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the goodwill and GAAP terms in our earnings materials. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction based expenses and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, references to revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain items. With us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chair and CEO; Warren Gardiner, Chief Financial Officer; Ben Jackson, President; Lynn Martin, President of the NYSE; and Chris Edmonds, President of Fixed Income and Data Services. I'll now turn the call over to Warren. Warren Gardiner : Thanks, Katia. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with a summary of our record quarterly results. Second quarter net revenues totaled a record $2.3 billion. Pro forma for the acquisition of Black Knight, total revenue increased by 7% versus last year and is up 6% through the first half of 2024. Second quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $947 million, up 1% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. As a result of this strong performance, adjusted pro forma operating income increased by 11% versus the prior year reaching a record $1.4 billion, with record adjusted earnings per share totaling $1.52. Moving to the balance sheet, adjusted leverage ended the second quarter at approximately 3.7 times pro forma EBITDA, a reduction from 3.9 times at the end of the first quarter and 4.3 upon the completion of Black Knight in the third quarter of 2023. Before I move to our segment results, I will note a few third quarter guidance items. We expect third quarter adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $955 million to $965 million or at the midpoint, an increase of roughly 1% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, with growth across our Exchange and FID segments largely offset by expense synergies, which we now anticipate will exit 2024 at an annualized run rate of over $150 million, up from prior expectations of $135 million. Relative to the second quarter, we expect the sequential increase to be driven by higher occupancy costs, slightly higher compensation, including an accrual for our strong performance year-to-date and higher depreciation expense as revenue related data center investments continue to come online. Moving below the line, adjusted non-operating expense is expected to be between $190 million to $195 million, driven by lower interest expense as we continue to direct free cash flows to reducing debt outstanding. Now let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Second quarter net revenues totaled a record $1.2 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Record transaction revenues of $884 million were up 20%, driven by a 40% increase in our interest rate business and record energy revenues, which grew 33% year-over-year. This strong energy performance included a 30% increase in our oil complex, 32% growth in global natural gas revenues and 64% growth in our environmental business. In addition, as of the end of July, open interest is up 20% year-over-year, including 21% growth in global interest rates and 25% growth in our energy markets. Shifting to recurring revenues, which include our exchange data services and our NYSE listings business, revenues totaled $362 million in the second quarter. Mid-single-digit growth in our broader exchange data services was underpinned by high-single-digit growth in futures data, in part driven by the continued expansion of our global energy and environmental network. In our listings business, SPAC delistings and the rolling off of 2021 admission fees offset a solid quarter for new listings. Through the first half and despite only half of IPOs eligible to list, the NYC has helped raise $12 billion in new proceeds, welcoming 30 new operating companies, including seven of the top ten IPOs. Absent a sharp recovery in IPOs in the second half, we would expect the listings revenues to trend around current levels through the balance of this year. Turning now to Slide 6, I'll discuss our fixed income and Data Services segment. Second quarter revenues totaled $565 million. Transaction revenues totaled $108 million. Transaction revenue growth at ICE bonds was once again driven by strong growth across both corporates and munis, particularly our institutional channel, which grew double-digits year-over-year. Record recurring revenues totaled $457 million and grew by 5% year-over-year, slightly ahead of expectations. In our Fixed Income Data and Analytics business, record second quarter revenues of $293 million increased by 6% year-over-year and was driven by growth in pricing and reference data, another quarter of double-digit growth in our index business, and higher than anticipated one-time revenue. Other Data and Network Services grew 5% in the second quarter, driven by our consolidated fees business and continued strength in our oil and gas desktop solutions, both of which are products that we have invested in organically enhancing both content and functionality. Total ASV or annual subscription value, exited the quarter up 4% year-over-year, coupled with visibility into our sales pipeline for the balance of this year and assuming flat markets, we are on track to grow total Fixed Income and Data Services recurring revenue around the middle of our mid-single-digit guidance range, an improvement from 3% growth in 2023. Please flip to Slide 7, where I'll discuss the results of our Mortgage Technology segment. ICE Mortgage Technology revenues were over $506 billion in the second quarter. Recurring revenues totaled $387 million. Relative to the first quarter, revenue from new customers coming online was offset by attrition within our data and document automation product or DDA, and was primarily related to non-encompassed customer on our legacy platform, who was not utilizing DDA's full capabilities. Despite this attrition, quarterly sales of DDA were the strongest since early 2022, including the signing of JPMorgan Chase, a current user of DBA on the origination side, to utilize the platform for their servicing business, a win that is a testament to past investments and synergies with MSP. In addition, while the majority of customers continue to renew at higher minimums, similar to the last few quarters, we also saw customers renew lower. It's important to note that lower minimums are paired with a higher transaction fee or price per closed loan and net total contract value, assuming normal market conditions continues to increase upon renewal. Transaction revenues totaled $119 million in the second quarter, while revenues related to encompass closed loans, applications and MERS registrations increased in the low single-digits on a year-over-year basis and increased well into the double-digits sequentially. Growth was somewhat offset by transaction revenues related to the aforementioned DNA attrition, as well as lower default management revenues within our servicing business. While the mortgage origination market is trending below historical levels and refinance ways can be difficult to predict, we are seeing encouraging signs that fundamentals are stabilizing. According to ICE Mortgage Technology Data, while still below pre-COVID levels, the number of homes on the market continues to grow, up nearly 40% versus this time last year. In addition, tappable home equity hit record levels at the end of June, reaching $11.5 trillion with over 30 million homeowners with at least $100,000 to draw down upon. And we estimate that the number of borrowers with an incentive to refinance at current rates is at its highest level in two years, driven by slightly lower interest rates and a building backlog of higher rate purchase loans. And so we continue to invest in product development and enhancement and we continue to expand our existing network, all which further position our platform to realize accelerating growth when market conditions normalize. In summary, we delivered a record first half. We once again delivered revenue growth, operating income growth and free cash flow growth. We continue to invest across our business to meet the needs of our customers and to position our business to continue to deliver consistent and compounding growth for our stockholders into the future. I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A, but for now I'll hand it over to Ben. Benjamin Jackson : Thank you, Warren and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 8. In the more than 20 years ICE has been building its global energy platform. We have strategically positioned our energy business for the globalization of natural gas and the societal demand for a transition to clean energies. Our long-term strategic direction and the value of our diverse, deep and liquid markets contributed to record trading volumes across our energy complex in the second quarter. This was a key driver to another quarter of record energy revenues, up 33% year-over-year and growing double-digits on average over the past five years. This strong performance is a testament to our customers continued confidence in ICE as the global energy hedging venue of choice. And with open interest continuing to set records into July, up 25% year-over-year, our energy complex appears poised for continued strength. As the world evolves, market participants are constantly adjusting and weighing the price impact of an array of macroeconomic, geopolitical and regulatory forces, as well as externalities such as climate risk and the emergence of new renewable fuel sources. In essence, the price formation process is increasingly becoming more complex, and that additional complexity is driving customer demand for more precise risk management tools. It is also driving demand for customers to come to a single place to manage risk across oil, gas, power and environmentals because of the efficiency and deep liquid markets that we provide. Across natural gas, the evolution of a global market is accelerating. This acceleration is underpinned by the rise of liquefied natural gas, market based pricing and more recently, Europe's renewed openness to gas imports after the elimination of Russia as a key supplier and the emergence of North America as a leading natural gas exporter. Alongside this, as an important partner fuel, emitting about half as much carbon dioxide as coal to produce, natural gas continues to benefit from demand for cleaner fuels as countries move to reduce their carbon emissions. Additionally, the natural gas markets were historically regional oriented, each characterized by distinct pricing and supply dynamics. All these factors underpin the emergence of three key benchmarks for natural gas across North America, Europe and Asia, with these becoming increasingly interconnected. In Europe, our Title Transfer Facility contract or TTF is a central trading point for natural gas, just as Brent is the global benchmark for oil pricing. As a result, TTF is increasingly being used by global commercial participants, traders and investors, with a record number of market participants in the second quarter that has doubled since 2019. This has been accompanied by volumes and open interest increasing, with both setting new highs in the second quarter and each are growing double-digits on average over the past five years. In Asia, our Japan, Korea Marker, or JKM, reflects the spot market value of cargoes delivered into the region that represents a key demand center for LNG, underpinned by surging economic growth and increasing focus on environmental concerns. In 2023, global coal consumption reached its highest level in history driven by continued growth in Asia. While coal continues to be replaced by natural gas and other cleaner energy sources in Europe and North America, it still accounts for 47% of primary energy consumption in Asia. In absolute terms, the coal switching opportunity in Asia alone represents more energy than the total energy consumption in North America across all primary energy sources. Today, the relationship between our TTF and JKM benchmarks drives global price formation. Reflecting this dynamic, ICE's JKM volumes have shifted from being roughly 50% composed of the JKM TTF spread to closer to two thirds. This dynamic also illustrates market confidence in relying on TTF as a benchmark for global gas and LNG prices as participants draw assurance from its deep liquidity, rather than relying on the Asian marker in isolation. In North America, we began preparing for the liberalization of natural gas and its evolution beyond the Henry Hub benchmark more than a decade ago. Through close collaboration with our customers, we created ICE's electronic regional basis markets, a suite of precise risk management tools reflecting the commercially relevant supply and demand dynamics of 70 hubs across North America. These hubs are priced at a differential to Henry hub to reflect U.S. regional market conditions, transportation costs and transmission capacity between locations. Alongside this, many market participants seeking to manage exposure to U.S. natural gas price dynamics, gravitate towards ICE's Henry Hub contracts for liquidity and the linkage to our exclusive basis markets. As the global landscape of LNG exports, geopolitical forces and shifts to cleaner energy sources all continue to evolve, we see these dynamics underpinning the strong momentum for this business and we see these trends continuing to favor our growing global gas complex well into the future. The importance of the evolution of energy markets extends to our global environmental markets where the number of market participants has nearly doubled since 2019, setting an all-time high in the second quarter and increasing 18% year-over-year. At the same time, volumes increased 61% in the quarter, including growth across our regional greenhouse gas initiative allowances, California carbon allowances as well as our EU and UK allowances. This strong performance has contributed to a 43% increase in environmental revenues year-to-date, including 64% growth in the second quarter. In parallel, across our power markets, volumes increased 32% in the first half, including 51% growth in the second quarter. With AI and data center build outs expected to drive meaningful power demand into the next decade, our platform is uniquely positioned to capture this tailwind and help market participants manage this potentially volatile growth story, given that ICE is the most comprehensive platform that offers U.S. regional gas markets alongside deep and liquid power and environmental markets. In summary, for market participants seeking to manage their risk, ICE's global energy platform offers over 1000 futures and options contracts across natural gas, power, environmental and oil markets, supporting the growing complexity of energy markets and uniquely positioning us to benefit from both near-term volatility and secular growth trends occurring across these markets. Moving to our Fixed Income and Data Services business, our quality pricing and reference data, combined with over 40 years of price history, serve as the foundation for what is today one of the largest providers of fixed income indices globally. Year-to-date, revenue in our index business is up double digits, with passive ETF assets under management benchmark to our indices growing to a record $616 billion through the end of the second quarter, from less than $100 billion in 2017 and doubling since 2020. In addition, we continue to see returns on past investments made to enhance content and functionality across our other data and network services business. As an example, within our consolidated fees business, investments we've made to elevate and enhance our offering have directly contributed to the double-digit revenue growth in this area year-to-date. With content from over 600 data sources, our offering gives customers access to a broad universe of low latency financial information with full depth of market data. As firms seek more high quality data from a range of different sources in a cost efficient manner, our competitive and comprehensive offering stands to benefit. While our consolidated fees and index businesses are smaller components of our comprehensive data platform today, they're both well positioned to continue to grow and capture market share while also serving an important role in our broader enterprise sales strategy. Turning now to our mortgage business, the secular shift towards the adoption of an electronic workflow continues. With a life of loan offering that spans from point of consumer acquisition all the way through to the secondary market, our platform is uniquely positioned to play a fundamental role. In the second quarter, we closed on 29 new Encompass clients as customers focus on modernizing their infrastructure and on workflow efficiencies. Building on wins announced last quarter, such as Citizens Bank and Webster Bank, we are pleased to announce that mortgage Solutions of Colorado has signed on to Encompass expanding on the MSP win we announced late last year. We have also just signed another top 15 home builder in the U.S. to Encompass and our DDA platform, making them the 9th homebuilder of the top 15 to join our community. In addition, as mentioned last quarter, we've been integrating our tax, flood and closing fees data into Encompass, providing customers with more choice of service providers on our platform. In that regard, we're encouraged by the early traction in our cross-sell efforts across these offerings, executing on 200 data cross-sells to Encompass clients in the first half. While these offerings are small components of our business today, these wins give us confidence in our ability to execute on the synergy targets that we laid out at the time of the Black Knight transaction. Along the same lines, following the first integration of Encompass to MSP by leveraging our data and document automation platform for loan onboarding straight from origination through to servicing, we are pleased to announce that we signed JPMorgan Chase onto this service. For our traditional DDA business we also had 12 new wins to new and existing Encompass clients in the second quarter alone. In summary, we are pleased to see the value of our platform and solutions are providing by our comprehensive technology platform that it's resonating in the marketplace. With a touch point to nearly every market participant, we have connectivity to a customer base in need of the automation that our digital solutions provide. As these new customers come onto our network, we have the opportunity to expand the customer relationship over time as they adopt additional solutions. Just as we've seen in our other markets, this flywheel effect gives us confidence that we can grow our business that today is only a fraction of the $14 billion addressable market that's in the early days of an analog to digital conversion. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey Sprecher : Thank you, Ben. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Please turn to Slide 9. At ICE, our mission for more than 20 years has been to drive transparency and create workflow efficiencies for our customers. We do this by building and operating mission critical digital networks that leverage our technology, data and operating expertise. At the time of our IPO on the New York Stock Exchange in 2005, we were purely an energy exchange offering only a handful of products to a narrow customer base. Since then, our focus has been building a global platform that has the asset class breadth to enable us to pursue growth opportunities quickly and efficiently as they emerge around the world and deliver all weather results. While we're known for some of our larger scale acquisitions, we have also completed a wide range of smaller bolt-on transactions. We reimagine these businesses by leveraging technology and crafting significant product development to drive organic growth, further bolstering the content on our networks and accelerating our broadening into new asset classes. Operating marketplaces with strong network effects is a core expertise at ICE, and today we do so across an array of asset classes, geographies and customer types. Optimizing the operation of financial services databases helps drive market transparency and this transparency attracts additional participant, which in turn improves market liquidity. It's a virtuous cycle that continuously expands the network while strengthening the market. Starting with our commodities business in 2001, we acquired the International Petroleum Exchange, which brought us both proprietary content in the form of the Brent Crude Index, as well as connectivity to a broad network of energy traders and commercial customers. Building on that foundation, we organically developed and grew hundreds of precise hedging instruments to serve the evolving needs of this commercial customer base. Today, the original Brent crude contract trades alongside our Midland WTI, Cushing WTI, Platts Dubai and Middle East Murban grades of crude to additionally support over 800 related commodity products developed by ICE, giving participants the ability to manage the price of energy at the point of consumption or production around the world. NYBOT: Starting from a simple idea, we have grown it into one of the largest clearinghouses in the world. Our experience in building, trading, clearing and settlement infrastructure highlighted for us the importance of analytics, indices and trade valuation services and in 2015, we broadened our addressable market moving into fixed income with the acquisition of Interactive Data Corporation. IDC's pricing and reference data businesses are key to transparent price formation in the fixed income markets. They laid the foundation for our expansion into the adjacent index business and the development of a comprehensive platform that today we've grown to nearly 500 unique institutional grade data products. Another example of ICE leveraging our technology and infrastructure is our June 24 announcement to apply our proven track record, our expertise in central clearing and our connectivity to the fixed income markets to launch a clearing service for U.S. treasury securities and repurchase agreements. The U.S. treasury and repo markets are critical to the global collateral management infrastructure and we are significant users of these treasury products across our six clearinghouses. A new SEC rule beginning in 2025 sheds light on the fact that no existing clearing offering is compliant with the rule, opening an opportunity for ICE. We look forward to working with our clients and the entire treasury ecosystem to deliver on this innovation. Following the proven playbook we've applied across futures and fixed income markets and by leveraging our expertise in building new technology, we've expanded into the U.S. consumer interest rate markets by developing a digital financing infrastructure for home mortgages. In 2016, we acquired a majority position in the Mortgage Electronic Registry System. We applied ICE's technology expertise to rebuild and modernize its platform and database, allowing us to buy the remaining business stake in 2018. We've since bought and built our way into further market exposure that culminated with the completion of our acquisition of Black Knight last year. Today, these assets are part of our broader ICE Mortgage Technology business that we believe is uniquely positioned at the center of an asset class that is moving from analog to digital. The breadth and depth of what we have assembled touches nearly every home mortgage in the United States and includes the largest network of partners that every day ensure that our thousands of customers can efficiently engage, originate, close, finance, value and sell consumer home loans. Our approach to overlaying organic growth on our strategic acquisitions is deliberate and comprehensive, allowing us to construct a platform that not only generates strong returns and healthy cash flows, but is also positioned to continue to leverage our core strengths to generate future growth. Our first half results are another example of strong execution of this proven strategy. We delivered record revenues, record adjusted operating income and record adjusted earnings per share. These record setting results reflect the strength of our network and the all-weather nature of our business model. As we've grown and diversified, we've broadened our opportunity set and our expertise has grown, yielding new markets to grow into and new ways to deliver innovative solutions to our customers. Our evolution has been intentional, diversifying across asset classes and geographies and increasing our mix of recurring revenues with a goal of building a business that today generates compounding earnings growth. Looking to the second half of the year and beyond, we're excited about the many growth opportunities that are in front of us, and we remain focused on delivering innovative solutions for our customers while driving compounding all-weather growth for our stockholders. Before I end my prepared remarks, I'd like to say thank you to our customers for their business and for their trust. And I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contribution to both the best single quarter and the best first half in our company's history. With that, I'll turn the call back to our moderator, Drew, and we'll conduct a question and answer session until 09 :30 a.m. Eastern Time.

With that, I'll turn the call back to our moderator, Drew, and we'll conduct a question and answer session until 09 :30 a.m. Eastern Time. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Craig Siegenthaler : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Our question is on the fixed income business. So we've seen a nice acceleration in fixed income ASV this year. What's driving this? Which channels are seeing the most growth and to what extent is the growth stemming from pricing versus cross-sell versus new clients? Warren Gardiner : Hey, Craig, I'll start that one off. This is Warren. So it's been pretty broad based across the recurring revenue base within that segment and so we've seen some improvements in the PRV [ph] business. As you know, last few years, the fixed income ecosystem has been facing a number of headwinds given the sharp rise in interest rates and so as we've seen that taper off, we've seen a reengagement from that customer base which has helped on the new sales front and we've seen some improvements there, certainly over the last couple of quarters it's helped. The other area that's been helpful as well is on the index side, where the last year or so we had faced some headwinds there, largely just due to markets and things of that nature, where we've seen that now reverse and obviously fund flows into fixed income funds as well has been a helpful component of that from a growth perspective. And then I'd also say within the Other Data Network services, within our desktop business, our fees business, which you heard us highlight, we've seen some really strong trends there as well and that's really a result of some of the investments we've made over the last number of years to get those into better positions. So we've been pretty pleased with that progress. I think we certainly did face some headwinds last year at a macro level and as you've seen those abate, you've seen improvement in the revenue trends and the ASV trends. And I think one thing that ASV doesn't necessarily always pick up or doesn't pick up, I mean, it's a good metric, it's not perfect, is that sales that we've made that have not yet implemented. And so as we mentioned last quarter, we do think on the connectivity side related to some of our data center investments, we'll see some of those sales start to implement in the third and the fourth quarter. That will be a little bit of help as well. So we're encouraged by that as we look into the back half. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Worthington from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. You mentioned that you expanded the Chase relationship as another win this quarter. So maybe first, how does the institutional pipeline look for Encompass in MSP? Is it building? Is it stable or is ICE just really working through that existing pipeline? And then second, ICE has a number of larger mortgage wins that you've announced over the last 18 months. What is the magnitude of the impact we should expect as these clients go live on transaction and recurring revenue over the second half of this year or maybe into the first six months of next year as these new larger relationships are launched? Jeffrey Sprecher : Thanks, Ken. I'll start and then Warren will pick up on the second part of that question. So we're very pleased with the expansion of the relationship with JPMorgan Chase. Obviously, they're been a longtime MSP client. They've added Encompass across all channels and have added DDA for the origination side and now are leveraging DDA as that integration point to automatically onboard loans from Encompass into MSP. So that's a great win for us and it's really in line with the vision of why we put together all these assets is to provide the efficiency that these platforms provide for institutions. And in terms of the funnel behind that, we continue, as you've seen each quarter, announcing new wins. And whether it's MSP wins for clients that have historically been on Encompass, and we've had a great relationship with or the other way around, clients that have been on MSP that are signing on to Encompass, we're very pleased with the success that we've had out of the gate, and we continue to see that funnel building and it's building in a couple of different ways. It's building from clients that realize they don't need to have their own in-house bespoke systems. That's oftentimes what we're replacing in particular on the very large institutional side for this. And really the secret sauce should be how do they cross-sell to their clients and understand more about that overall relationship across the institutional enterprise that those banks have with the clients, as opposed to coming up with some unique way to run a loan origination system or a servicing system. So that funnel continues to build. We feel good about that on both sides, on both MSP and Encompass, and with a number of the wins that we've had and that you've even referenced in your question, we have a lot of those going through implementations, and as you can appreciate, we have a large backlog of those implementations. They're going very well. They just take time. They're very complex. There's a lot of compliance aspects in and around mortgage in fact in most areas that these banks work. Mortgage is probably one of the most heavily compliance -- areas of compliance they have to comply with. So those implementations take time. And I'll hand the second part of it off to Warren. Warren Gardiner : Yeah. So Ken, on your question around the size of some of the wins and maybe how the cadence of how those will kind of come into the run rate, so I think, look, back in the fourth quarter, we talked about revenue synergies around $30 million. I can tell you that we've continued to add to that number and made progress against that number. That's something I'll probably give more on an annual basis in terms of the actual number, but I can tell you that we have been making progress over the last couple of quarters there. Like I said back then as well, we wouldn't expect, we don't expect a material impact this year from those revenue synergies. MSP products Encompass, they can tend to take six to 18 months, if not longer, particularly for ones that are larger, which is what a lot of these wins that we've talked about are. And so it does take time to implement that technology and that's part of why you're seeing those kind of take some time to get into the run rate. And so we'll expect those to start to come in 2025 and 2026, as obviously those companies come online and that will flow into recurring revenue at that point. Operator : Our next question is from Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. So another question on mortgage. I was hoping you could flush out a little bit of what transpired, I think in the quarter with you talked about a client leaving, so we wanted to get a bit of an update more broadly on the kind of renegotiations and where you are, you think, in the overall customer base for the new minimums. And as you think about the recurring revenue mix, is that, I guess, do you anticipate more kind of fluctuations and/or fits and starts as you kind of go through that process, as we look kind of prospectively from here? Benjamin Jackson : Sure, Dan, this is Ben. I'll take this one. So I'll start with the second part of it on the renegotiations and Warren mentioned it in his prepared remarks as well. We continue on the Encompass side to see the majority of the clients. So the number of clients that are renewing are renewing at higher subscriptions. And when that happens, we have a lower foreclosed loan fee is typically the trade-off there, but we do have a percent that we've seen in similar the last few quarters that are choosing to renew at lower minimums, lower subscription fees. And the trade-off there is higher foreclosed loan fees. And as the market normalizes, the algorithm that we have is the total contract value going to go up and that's what we're consistently targeting and executing against. So we're seeing that trend in terms of renegotiation continue. And it's been very much in line with what we've seen in past quarters. On the attrition that Warren mentioned in his prepared remarks that was on the DDA side. So with that data and document automation platform, this is a platform that Ellie Mae acquired a number of years ago, and there are some legacy clients on that platform that don't utilize the automation capabilities that that platform has in line with Encompass or with MSP. They're using it in isolation and that's where we saw the attrition happened with one client that Warren referenced. The other opportunity that we see here though, is that we had another client that was very similarly situated to that one that we engaged with very deeply and convinced them to change their loan origination provider from where they were in the past to moving over to Encompass and couple that with the DDA platform and we were successful in doing that. And in the second quarter, that's the Citizens Bank win that I had referenced was exactly that. We renegotiated a DDA contract, brought them on to Encompass, and have a much more longer term strategic relationship with the client. Warren Gardiner : And then Dan, just a comment on recurring revenue. I think that starts to stabilize around here as we move through the back half. Obviously the market environment is weighed versus what we were thinking later last year when we spoke to you guys about or early this year when we spoke to you guys about what we thought the recurring revenue would look like for the year. I noted a few points in my script supporting that. We've seen some stabilization in those fundamentals and actually more directly related to us through the first half of this year, we've seen an increase in loans originated on Encompass. We've seen an increase in apps on Encompass, and that's encouraging. That's the first time we've seen a year-over-year increase since early 2021. Some early signs that things are stabilizing and I think a more stable market is going to give people a little bit more reason to start to think about the future, plan for the future, and start to invest in some of these products, like a DDA, which I said had its best quarter in two years for sales. And so look M&A like we had a few quarters ago or last quarter, cancellations like we had this quarter on the DDA side that can be tough to predict. But for instance, that is, I think, as Ben said, there's a small amount of customers that are on DDA that don't use Encompass or MSP now. So attrition like we saw this quarter in that way, kind of seems less likely to be ahead when moving forward. And also, as I said, we won't expect to see some of those revenue synergies come in until next year. So at this point, it feels like we see some stabilization and looking forward to 2025 as those start to hit. Operator : Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt from KBW. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Kyle Voigt : Hey, good morning. Maybe just sticking on mortgage tech, in the past you've spoken about the significant kind of data exhaust that's generated by this combined Mortgage Technology business. I guess with Black Knight now having been closed for, I guess, roughly ten months, can you just speak a bit of more about how your thinking has evolved around the best ways to potentially monetize this mortgage data, whether that's new product launches or other areas of opportunity? Benjamin Jackson : Thanks, Kyle. This is Ben. So we see a number of different opportunities in this area and I'll describe a few. Some that are very near-term and I mentioned this in my script as well, is that we saw an opportunity to take a bunch of data sets that Black Knight's data business had and integrate them onto Encompass. We had that as part of our plan even before we closed as part of the integration strategy. That was one of the first things we were going to do. We executed on that. We just closed last September, got all those data sets onto Encompass for the first time. And in the first half of this year, we've had 200 cross-sells of flood data and fees, data sets that traditionally were not on Encompass to our Encompass customer base. So that's -- and there's a long runway to go on that when you think of 3000 Encompass customers and each of those data sets being cross-sell opportunities, there's a good runway ahead of us on that. The second thing that we executed on and we're very pleased with is, there's a data set within Black Knight that are AVMs, so they're valuations on homes. And with the trend right now with the amount of equity built up in homes, we've built a straight through service around home equity lines of credit that take our AVMs. So you can take the current valuation on a home, the servicer can take that information plus the data they know on the customer, present an offer for a home equity line of credit for a client and then feed that information directly into the origination platform as our Encompass platform handles home equity lines of credit seamlessly and then as those loans are originated, pass those straight through into servicing. So the AVMs are definitely a key component of that and home equity lines of credit is something that we're seeing are very popular right now. Longer term one of the things that we did strategically when we integrated these businesses, we took that Black Knight data business and we moved it into our Fixed Income and Data Services business with Chris and we just did that at the beginning of this year. The reason for that is we believe there's a lot of data sets within there, within Black Knight that traditionally have been sold to mortgage specific companies that have a lot of capital markets applicability and those are data sets like they're called McDash. There's another one called AFT, and another one EMBS. And all of them in a sense are predicting prepayments on loans or portfolio of loans or portfolios of mortgage backed securities. And obviously with our Fixed Income and Data Services business, we have a very significant business in pricing and reference data around mortgage backed securities. We have a whole community of customers with thousands of them that consume our Fixed Income and Data Services products. And that's where we're introducing the products as they are today, but also engaging with clients to get feedback on new services that we can build for more of a medium term opportunity. So those are some of the ones off the top of my head. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Allen from Citi. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Chris Allen : Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping we could dig into the growth in energy OI seemed really impressive growth since the middle of 2023. Any color, just in terms of whether it's new commercials coming on, hedging by existing market participants taking up maybe impact of macro funds. And also could you dig in a little bit on North American options OI which is up very nicely. What's been driving that? Does that have to, is that factoring into the complexity, increasing complexity, which Ben referenced earlier? Benjamin Jackson : Thanks for the question. So you've heard us over a number of different calls in a number of different years, point to the fact that the major difference that you see in the way that we've developed our energy markets, whether you're talking oil, gas and also the products like power and environmentals, we have focused on the commercial customer at the core. And that's why we've built out and not dependent on just one benchmark for the growth of our business. We've built out thousands of hedging products around the world across oil, gas, power emissions, is that our customers want to be able to hedge at the point of production or consumption, as Jeff referred to even in his prepared remarks today. And it's those customers that we've really been building open interest around our platform. And obviously as open interest builds, as liquidity builds the platform, that's when you start to get also people that are taking more of a directional view on the market start to come in as well. But the leading people are the commercials and when we talk about even the success that we've had in our natural gas markets that started with a heavy, heavy commercial base. Our sweet spot in the U.S. has been the regional basis markets. Customers utilize those. And when they're trading that as a package with Henry Hub, that's what's helped to build out our Henry Hub market, because they want to do both of those trades in the same location. The same is true with the development of TTF and now with U.S natural gas moving around the world in the form of LNG and Europe consuming more U.S. LNG than from any other source and then also that coal switching opportunity that I mentioned in my prepared remarks across Asia being the size of North America itself, all of this is pointed at the commercial market participants that started in JKM and TTF has built up open interest in those products. And then we've obviously had directional traders flow in behind that. So that's a little color on that front. And on the options front, we're pleased with our options growth across the entire portfolio. Today there are a lot of risks that people need to manage. You have geopolitical risk with multiple wars going on. You've got political risks with elections pending and what that's going to mean for energy policy. And you have financial risks around what's going to happen with interest rates and all these have an impact. And options can be a very efficient way to hedge and manage risk in those situations. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Budish from Barclays. Please go ahead. Benjamin Budish : Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the question. Ben, I was wondering if you could unpack the Asia opportunity a little bit more and maybe talk about the historical correlation between consumption of electricity and energy and trading volumes. When we look at sort of the European data, it looks like consumption of natural gas is pretty flat over a long period of time, but your volumes are up very meaningfully over a similar period of time. Presumably a pickup in consumption, really anywhere, would be quite positive. But how do you think about the correlation? How much could that drive volumes versus things like price volatility? How much those relative factors matter? Thank you. Benjamin Jackson : Thanks, Ben. Yes, those dynamics definitely matter. When people are looking at and whether you're a power producer or a consumer, the mix of things that you need to think about in trading is not only the power, the price of power itself, but also what's producing it, whether it's coal or switching to natural gas as a much cleaner fuel. And then also the dynamic around the world of also having to put a price on carbon emissions that are also a part of that. So traders that are thinking about this, hedgers that are thinking about their exposure in the energy markets have to think about all four of those dynamics. And we for many years have thought from engaging with our clients that that's the mix of risks that need to be managed. And that's why we've built out a business that includes all of those aspects to enable traders to hedge and manage that risk in one platform. And I'll even use the U.S. as a good example. I mean, if you look at the U.S., there has been a shift towards cleaner sources in gas. It's clear if you talk to any of the analysts out there that power consumption is going to continue to grow in the U.S. And one of the underlying reasons for that is data center demand. It's analysts' estimates that U.S. power is expected to increase. Power demand is going to increase over the next decade. And data center demand alone associated to that is likely 19 gigawatts last year to growing to up to 35 gigawatts by the end of this decade. And then underneath that you have natural gas demand that's linked to power generation. That today is around 35 billion cubic feet is expected from analysts estimates to grow to 45 billion cubic feet by the end of this decade. And then obviously you have markets like our environmental markets that continue to do well. Like our Reggie markets and our California carbon emissions. So I think that's a good story to tell because we see that story developing in Europe. We see that story developing in Asia and the mix of having U.S. basis markets, power, Henry and environmental markets all in one place and enabling customers to hedge and manage this risk in an efficient basis is what enables us to do this and provide those services to clients. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Kramm from UBS. Please go ahead. Alex Kramm : Mr: Cooper: Warren Gardiner : Thanks Alex, I'll start. So in particular in the servicing business you do have mortgage servicing rights that trade and move between clients and we're a beneficiary if those mortgage servicing rights move to servicers that are on MSP and it's the opposite if they're nothing. We -- and I think I've mentioned this on the last call, the first half this year we did see some impact on the servicing side of the business where there was a major bank had been very public about the fact that they were exiting their correspondent business and selling those MSRs. So that had some headwinds to us that hit us the first half of this year. RoundPoint: These tend to ebb and flow on us and off of us. On the Mr. Cooper question that you had, we have a deep relationship with Mr. Cooper. They've been a customer of ours for a number of years on Encompass. They also use our foreclosure and bankruptcy solutions within servicing. So we have a good relationship with them and we look forward to seeing what their plans are in the future. But as it relates to customers leaving us and choosing a different platform, we're not seeing that type of impact. Benjamin Jackson : And then Alex, just to give you on Flagstar our total ICE mortgage technology revenues. Alex Kramm : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open, please go ahead. Alex Blostein : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. So maybe just zooming out on energy for a second, revenue growth up 30% or something like that this year, OI is trending something similar to that. I think we talked a lot about some of the structural tailwinds that are supporting this growth. But as you guys sort of zoom out and you extrapolate this further out, how do you think about the energy revenue growth algorithm over the next couple of years? And is 2024 a good base in your view, to build off of? I know the market tends to mean revert some of the dynamics and the trading space, but it doesn't feel like that's exactly what's happening here. Thanks. Benjamin Jackson : Hi Alex, it's Ben. Thanks for the question. What we always look at is the health of open interest across our markets as the barometer and really the predictor for future volumes and future volume potential for our markets. And if you look across our marketplace now, overall across all of our futures business, open interest versus last year is up 20%. In energy it's up 25%. So to us those are great indicators that we're doing the right things, partnering with our customers, developing out all of these very new innovations and new products and more precision in the way that customers can manage and hedge their risk around the world. The development of new products in oil have been really exciting for us with what we've innovated with our HOU contract, pricing Midland WTI basis, Houston, which is now flowing into dated Brent. And that market is growing phenomenally for us up 400% in open interest. You look at the development of our Murban contract that we innovated three years ago, pricing Middle Eastern crude going to Asia, ADVs in that contract are up 160%. All of our swaps to futures markets, these are all refined products and base markets continue to grow really nice for us in oil. In natural gas we continue to innovate and continue to introduce new contracts, new LNG contracts. We've talked about the development of JKM, the development of our TTF contract. All of these in our minds create a flywheel effect because anybody that's trading in these energy markets wants to put a price on oil, power, gas emissions, and it's so much more efficient for them to do that all in one place. So I'd point to the innovation that we've had. The open interest growth there has also fed into the growth of our benchmark contracts as well. Operator : That concludes today's Q&A session. I will now hand back over to Jeff Sprecher for closing remarks. Jeffrey Sprecher : Well, thank you, Drew, for managing the call. And I want to thank you all for joining us this morning. And we look forward to updating you again very soon as we continue to innovate for our customers and build our all-weather business model to continue to drive growth. With that, I hope you'll have a great day. Operator : That concludes today's call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your line.",

[Operator Instructions] I'll now hand you over to Katia Gonzalez, Manager of Investor Relations, to begin. Please go ahead. Katia Gonzalez : Good morning. ICE's third quarter 2024 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of ice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2023 Form 10-K, 2024 third quarter Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the prevailing GAAP terms in the earnings materials. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, references to revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain items. With us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chair and CEO; Warren Gardiner, Chief Financial Officer; Stuart Williams, Chief Operating Officer; Lynn Martin, President of the NYSE; and Chris Edmonds, President of Fixed Income and Data Services. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey Sprecher : Thank you, Katia. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Ben Jackson is not able to join today's call as he's recovering from a successful knee surgery. Our Chief Operating Officer, Stuart Williams, is in the room with us today. Ben plans to be back in a few days' time. Let's start by turning our call over to Warren. Warren Gardiner : Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with a summary of our record third quarter results. Third quarter net revenues totaled a record $2.3 billion, including record transaction revenues of $1.1 billion and record recurring revenues of $1.2 billion. Pro forma for the acquisition of Black Knight, total revenue increased by 7% versus last year and is up 6% through the first 3 quarters of 2024. Third quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $960 million, up 1% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. As a result of this strong performance, adjusted pro forma operating income increased by 12% versus the prior year, reaching a record $1.4 billion with adjusted earnings per share totaling a record $1.55. Moving to the balance sheet, we reduced debt outstanding by approximately $600 million during the quarter, ending the period with adjusted leverage of approximately 3.5x EBITDA. Before I move to our segment results, I will note a few guidance items. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect OTC and other revenue to be in the range of $75 million to $80 million as the third quarter benefited from several items we do not anticipate will repeat. In addition and similar to last year, in light of the strong performance in our cash equities business where revenues are up 15% year-to-date, we are providing customers with a regulatory fee holiday which we expect will reduce OTC and other revenues by $15 million to $20 million in the fourth quarter. Shifting to expenses, we expect fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $977 million to $987 million, including approximately $10 million to $15 million of items that we also do not expect will repeat. Lastly, full year CapEx is now expected to be in the range of $700 million to $740 million, largely driven by key data center investments originally planned for 2025. We expect these investments will yield expense efficiencies upon project completion in 2026. Now let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Third quarter net revenues totaled a record $1.3 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Record transaction revenues of $890 million were up 17%, driven by a 34% increase in our interest rate business and record energy revenues which grew 23% year-over-year. This strong energy performance was on top of 42% growth in last year's third quarter and included a 16% increase in our oil complex, 24% growth in global natural gas revenues and 60% growth in our environmental business. In addition, towards the end of October, open interest is up 23% year-over-year, including 32% growth in global interest rates and 26% growth in our energy markets. Shifting to recurring revenues which include our Exchange data services and our NYC listings business, revenue totaled $364 million which included a few million dollars related to auto recoveries. Underpinning growth in our recurring revenues was our broader Exchange data services which was once again led by the continued expansion of our global energy and environmental network. In our listings business, while less than half of global IPOs have met the standards to list so far in 2024, the NYSE has helped to raise $14 billion in new proceeds, welcoming 43 new operating companies, representing 7 of the top 10 IPOs and 8 of the top 10 performing IPOs year-to-date. In addition, NYSE continued its leadership on transfers welcoming 10 operating companies year-to-date. Turning now to Slide 6, I'll discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services segment. Third quarter revenues totaled a record $586 million, including transaction revenues of $125 million. On a year-over-year basis, growth in minis, corporates as well as CDS clearing activity was offset by lower treasury trading at ICE bonds and slightly lower member interest revenues. Record recurring revenues totaled $461 million and grew by 6% year-over-year. In our fixed income data and analytics business, revenues also increased by 6% year-over-year to a record $295 million, driven by growth in pricing and reference data and nearly 30% growth in our index business which benefited from both rising markets and fund flows into ETFs that track ICE indices. Importantly, ETF AUM tracking ICE indices ended the third quarter at a record $674 billion [ph]. Other data and network services revenues increased by 5% in the third quarter. Growth was driven by our ICE Global Network as recent data center investments have come online, growth in our consolidated feeds business and continued strength in our desktop solutions, driven in part by adoption of our energy desktop by both commercial customers and traders. These are just a few examples of investments we have made following our 2015 acquisition of IDC to continuously increase and enhance the content on our network as well as our underlying technology to drive growth. Please flip to Slide 7 where I'll discuss our Mortgage Technology results. Third quarter revenues totaled $509 million. Recurring revenues totaled $387 million. While recurring revenues declined year-over-year, as expected, they stabilized relative to the second quarter, driven by an improvement in data and analytics and offset by the semi-annual removal of retired loans on our servicing platform as well as lower minimums on Encompass. Similar to the last several quarters, while the majority of Encompass customers renewed at higher minimums, we also had customers renew at lower minimums. Importantly, lower minimums at renewal are also paired with a higher price per closed loan or transaction fee, a dynamic that will provide a more material tailwind to revenues as the origination market normalizes. Transaction revenues totaled $122 million, up slightly year-over-year and relative to the second quarter, driven by revenue related to Encompass closed loans and applications as well as an increase in MERS registrations. Looking at the fourth quarter, we expect total IMT revenues to be between $495 million and $505 million, with the delta relative to the third quarter largely driven by purchase market seasonality and related traction revenue. While mortgage origination volumes appear to have stabilized and seem likely to trend around these levels in the near term, we will continue to invest in developing new products, enhancing our technology and our existing product suite as well as expanding our network, all of which will further position our end-to-end platform to generate growth when market conditions normalize. In summary, we delivered record third quarter results, including record revenues, operating income and adjusted EPS, building upon our record first half results and representing the best year-to-date performance in our company's history. As we look to the balance of the year, we remain focused on meeting the needs of our customers, continuing to drive growth and creating value for our shareholders. I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll hand it over to Stuart. Stuart Williams : Thank you, Warren and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 8. For over 2 decades, we've worked closely with our customers to develop a network of diverse liquid and globally interconnected energy markets. This network provides the critical feedback loop required to solve near-term supply and demand imbalances and the long-term price signals needed to efficiently allocate capital investment to meet forward-looking demand. Today, our customers across the globe leverage our markets to help balance the demands of energy security, affordability and sustainability while allocating the capital necessary to meet rising energy demands critical to economic growth and managing the risks associated with a complex geopolitical environment. The breadth and depth of our global platform not only drove another record quarter across our energy complex but importantly, it positions us to capture secular tailwinds, including the globalization of natural gas and the clean energy transition, trends we began investing in over a decade ago. Through constant reinvention and innovation, Brent has firmly established itself as the global benchmark for crude oil, pricing roughly 3/4 of the world's internationally traded crude and from which prices are discovered in the U.S. Gulf Coast via ICE's Midland WTI Futures market and in the Middle East and Asia via ICE's Murban and Dubai futures markets. Reflecting this dynamic, volume in our global oil complex increased 17% year-over-year. This strong performance includes records across Brent, WTI, Midland WTI and Murban and contributed to record oil revenues which grew 16% in the quarter. These strong trends have continued into October with record total oil open interest up 28% and Brent options up 68 -- 86% year-over-year. These critical pricing relationships extend to refined oil products where ICE's low sulfur gas oil markets similarly anchors price discovery for refined products globally with markets such as ICE's Heating Oil Futures and ICE Singapore Gasoil reflecting regional dynamics in the U.S. and Asia, respectively. We continue to see strong growth across refined products with Gasoil open interest up 63% year-over-year, supporting double-digit growth across the refined products complex, including growth in cleaner fuels such as ICE's global marine fuel and biofuel markets. Today, cleaner energy sources, including global natural gas and environmental markets, account for roughly 45% of our energy revenues, up from 1/3 a decade ago and have grown 21% on average over the past 5 years, including 34% growth year-to-date. This strong performance has been a key contributor to the 13% average growth rate in our energy platform over that time frame, including 29% growth year-to-date. The globalization of natural gas through liquefied natural gas or LNG has created virtual pipelines across oceans, removing the dependency on fixed pipeline infrastructure and storage. This, together with the ongoing liberalization of the natural gas market and buyers increasingly favoring short-term contracts and spot market procurement, has put the more natural gas in motion over longer distances with a greater number of touch points along the value chain from production to consumption, creating a truly global commodity. Furthermore, given its abundance, lower emissions and lower switching costs, we expect natural gas to continue to benefit from increasing energy demand, particularly in the developing world and the ongoing focus on decarbonization. Since the year 2000, energy consumption in non-OECD countries has more than doubled with much of this growth coming in the form of coal. Last year, global coal consumption hit an all-time high, primarily supported by Asia where coal still accounts for nearly 50% of the region's energy supply. According to statistics published by the Energy Institute, the coal switching opportunity in Asia alone represents more energy than the total energy consumption in North America across all primary energy sources. In addition, the power demands of accelerating innovation, including artificial intelligence, are expected to require significant new generation capacity boosting demand for natural gas. These factors have caused markets across Europe, Asia and North America to become increasingly interconnected, accelerating demand for deep, liquid and global risk management tools. This evolution has driven the development of new trading relationships, as illustrated by record participation in our natural gas portfolio in the third quarter. This has been accompanied by volume and revenue growth with each growing double digits on average over the past 5 years, including 34% and 32% growth year-to-date, respectively. In addition, open interest trends remained strong through October, up 27% year-over-year, including a 51% increase in our TTF complex, a 53% increase in our Asian JKM market and a 24% increase in our North American gas business. As the Brent of natural gas, our Title Transfer Facility benchmark, or TTF, continues to be relied upon by an increasing number of market participants with market participation growing 15% on average over the past 5 years. In the third quarter, volumes in our TTF complex increased 16% year-over-year, driving revenue growth of 19% versus 2023. In Asia, underpinned by surging economic growth and a focus towards cleaner forms of energy, our Japan and Korea market, or JKM, continues to reach important milestones, setting records across key liquidity indicators in the third quarter, including participation, volume and open interest. Importantly, the extent to which global gas markets are interconnected was once again reinforced by JKM execution patterns with over 60% of JKM volumes executed via the JKM TTF spread. In North America, market participants seeking to manage exposure to U.S. natural gas pricing dynamics continue to gravitate towards ICE's Henry Hub contracts for the liquidity ICE offers in longer-dated tenors, along with the linkage to our exclusive regional basis markets which spans 70 trading hubs across North America. In the third quarter, volume in our North American gas complex increased 39% year-over-year. Finally, with Canada expected to significantly ramp up its LNG export capacity from 2025, increased exports from the West Coast of North America to Asia should add a further dimension to the supply equation. ICE's Calgary-based Natural Gas Exchange, or ICE NGX, has operated in the Alberta natural gas and electricity futures market for 30 years, developing the AECO hub into one of North America's most liquid spot and forward energy markets. ICE offers liquid markets in TTF, JKM, Henry Hub and the North American basis markets such as AECO, offering a broad range of natural gas benchmarks with trading hubs across Europe, Asia and North America. As the global landscape of LNG exports, geopolitical forces and shift towards cleaner energy all continue to evolve, we see these dynamics continuing to favor our growing global gas complex well into the future. As policy discussions on how best to deliver global sustainability objectives continue to evolve, our liquid and transparent environmental markets, first launched almost 2 decades ago, continue to see growth, providing transparent, market-based pricing for both positive and negative externalities. Here, we have seen the number of active market participants grow double digits on average over the past 5 years, including record participation in the third quarter, up 14% year-over-year. At the same time, our North American environmental complex reached record volumes in the quarter, increasing 70% versus prior year. While volumes in our European emission allowance futures and options increased 45%, this strong performance has contributed to the 49% growth in our environmental revenues year-to-date, including 60% growth in the third quarter. In summary, as the confluence of increasing energy demand, evolving supply chains and the energy transition continues to introduce new complexities, uncertainties and volatility into energy markets, our global environmental markets, alongside our global gas, oil, coal and power markets, provide the critical price transparency and risk management tools that will enable participants to navigate this multilayered and nonlinear transition. Before I hand over to Jeff, I wanted to briefly touch on our interest rate markets which hit record volume during the quarter, increasing 50% year-over-year. A mixed inflation picture, low unemployment, weaker economic data and ongoing geopolitical uncertainty continue to drive demand for interest rate risk management. ICE's liquid, multicurrency, short-term interest rate complex includes the key benchmark Euribor, SONIA and SARON markets used to manage short-term interest rate risk in euros, pound sterling and Swiss francs, respectively. As the benchmark for managing short-term euro interest rate risk, ICE's Euribor volume increased 47% year-over-year in the third quarter with open interest up 15% in October. The latest addition to ICE's multicurrency STIR complex, the euro short-term rate, or ESTER, continues to break records across all liquidity metrics, including open interest hitting a record 681,000 contracts during October. ICE's SONIA market, the benchmark for managing U.K. interest rate risk, traded a record 14 million contracts in September, contributing to a 53% growth year-to-date. Trends towards the end of October remained robust with open interest up 71%. ICE also hosts the Gilt futures market, the benchmark for the U.K. government bond yield curve, where volume is up 30% year-to-date, including 42% growth in the third quarter with open interest up 92% year-over-year. The disparity between the expected relative parts for the central banks has been a consistent theme over the last year. This has been beneficial for our rates franchise, both in terms of volume and open interest and looks set to continue as our customers rely on the deep liquidity and capital efficiencies at ICE. With that, I'll hand it over to Jeff. Jeffrey Sprecher : Thank you, Stuart. Please now turn to Slide 9. Operating marketplaces with strong network effects is a core expertise at ICE. Today, we do so across an array of asset classes, geographies and customer types. In the U.S. home mortgage market, we're following the proven playbook that we've applied across other asset classes. We're leveraging leading technology, mission-critical data and our network expertise to build innovative solutions that improve workflow efficiencies and connect market participants to one another. With a touch point to nearly every market participant in the U.S. mortgage space, we have connectivity to a customer base in need of the automation that our digital network provides for. September marked our 1-year anniversary since we closed on the acquisition of Black Knight. So I thought it would be appropriate to give you an update on how this company and its technologies have been integrated into our network. By adding Black Knight's servicing technology with its over 100 servicing clients and robust data and analytics to our network, ICE assembled a true life-of-loan offering that spans from the point of consumer acquisition all the way through to the secondary capital markets. We organized once-disparate assets into a unified network that communicates seamlessly from end to end. The construction of a mortgage can begin with our industry-leading customer engagement suite. We brought together Ellie Mae's Velocify and Consumer Connect platforms and married them to Black Knight's marketing automation solution called Surefire, tying together the pieces required for a complete customer engagement suite. Surefire leverages data to create effective marketing campaigns, nurtures them to the mortgage application and educates and informs borrowers throughout the funding process. Additionally, this platform provides direct channel outreach after the loan closing to help capture repeat business. Velocify is a sales automation solution that enables loan officers to capture missed opportunities and communicate with borrowers to close loans faster. And Consumer Connect provides a state-of-the-art digital mortgage experience to the consumer for the home buying process. We've unified these systems which now seamlessly operate as one to feed the Encompass loan underwriting platform. With Encompass, we successfully added a browser-based front end for loan underwriting and integrated new automation tools. And we added more ways to partner and extend the platform by increasing network APIs. Lenders can take advantage of products that are integrated via our partner network, while partners are able to build and release distributed products just one time. And once released, lenders can use a partner product across all of ICE Mortgage Technology's lender-facing applications. In addition, we connected data assets from Black Knight, including property tax, flood and closing fee information into Encompass. We also moved AllRegs, our market-leading tool for compliance-related information, into the ICE cloud and we deeply integrated it into Encompass. We enhanced this offering by incorporating a generative AI model so that natural language inquiries generate loan program information and guideline summaries from the most comprehensive compliance library available in the industry, covering nearly 1 million pages. We previously mentioned that we took a product formerly called AIQ, extended its capabilities to further automate data extraction and integrated it into Encompass. This product, now known as ICE Data & Document Automation, or DDA, captures the information provided by a borrower. Whether a document was shared via a portal, e-mail, fax or scan, DDA normalizes it, standardizes its naming and puts everything in the correct order. This creates consistency, uniformity and efficiency. A team of about 200 of our technologists have further expanded the capabilities of DDA by building sophisticated income and credit analyzers to deploy one of the most important new technologies to be offered in the U.S. mortgage space. These sophisticated analyzers transform formerly manual operations into automated, exception-based workflows. Key steps in the underwriting process are accelerated, including investigation to determine the creditworthiness of a wide range of borrowers for GSE guaranteed loan eligibility or for HUD's affordable loan program for a given metropolitan statistical area. This comes at a time when prospective homebuyers are facing the most daunting affordability challenges in 4 decades and at a time when many borrowers have nontraditional income streams that don't neatly fit on a Form W-2. These new analyzers drive greater operational efficiency to help lower mortgage origination costs for lenders and, ultimately, borrowers. We continue to invest in our product and pricing engine by providing additional options to lenders, servicers and their funding partners. We've connected our network directly to Fannie, Freddie and Ginnie Mae for seamless pricing inquiries. As a result, we went live with 32 new price engine clients this year, accompanied by a strong pipeline of 19 others that are currently in the implementation phase. We also deployed our team to bring Black Knight's loan servicing onto our network, recently announcing the integration of Encompass underwriting system with the MSP servicing system, with documents now moving straight from origination through to servicing. Taking it a step further, we also incorporated DDA into MSP so that servicers can quickly identify any critical information that may be missing from a loan file as the documents progress. And we cemented this integration milestone with the signing of JPMorgan Chase to also utilize this platform for their servicing business. We continue to enhance the MSP loan servicing technology since our acquisition of Black Knight by investing in a new user interface called MSP DX. This interface modernizes access and control of the legacy loan servicing platform and streamlines key tasks across loan onboarding, investor reporting and customer service. It allows users to seamlessly retrieve data and evoke servicing actions through a conversational user interface. And its expanded capability facilitates loan triage, providing users with an efficient view of relevant information when working on loan exceptions. We've also further automated the credit dispute processes to help mortgage servicers meet their 30-day reporting obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Our expertise at digitization has led to continued innovation for the secondary market for home mortgages. In the third quarter, we went live with our MBS mortality indicator which leverages data sets across ICE Mortgage Technology and ICE Data Services to produce daily trading signals for agency residential MBS pools. We believe these signals are significantly more accurate at predicting near-term prepayments than the legacy products in the market. In summary, we've assembled and expanded a leading customer engagement suite, underwriting tools, pricing systems, closing tools, registration tools, servicing systems and the resulting data and integrated them into ICE's network for the U.S. mortgage industry. ICE brings together the key industry stakeholders from origination to final settlement in a single network ecosystem. That's roughly 85% of all U.S. home mortgages connected to more than 3,000 lenders, 48,000 settlement agents and closing attorneys, 2,500 county governments, the GSEs, 80,000 notaries, 100 loan servicing companies, 1,000 mortgage-backed security investment firms and thousands of third-party data and service providers who can now communicate with one another via a common data standard on a robust network operated under ICE's cyber overlay. We believe that we've created a platform where every new participant who joins this network makes the platform increasingly more valuable to its other users. Essentially, we've moved ICE from selling software to offering a growing network for the management of the home mortgage life cycle. Throughout this journey and consistent with our approach across other asset classes, we remain focused on executing on our strategy of relieving pain points across the mortgage workflow while investing ahead of secular growth to enhance the value proposition of our network. Turning now to Slide 10. Since our founding, ICE has operated with a strategy to build tools and markets for institutions and consumers which operate in the white space of the inefficiencies of legacy markets. We seek to do so in a manner that enables us to grow our earnings in all economic conditions so that ICE is truly an all-weather growth story. Our record third quarter following up on our unsurpassed first half results are a testament to the execution of this strategy, the business model that we've intentionally built and the value of our strategic capital allocation. It's how we've grown our adjusted earnings per share every year that we've been a public company. And finally, I'd like to retell you that a decade ago, ICE sought to expand in the global financial markets by merging LIFFE, the London International Financial Futures Exchange, with our London-based commodity exchange and clearinghouse in order to create a global risk management powerhouse. With great respect, I'd like to end my prepared remarks by acknowledging the contributions of Sir Brian Williamson and Hugh Freedberg who built, saved and nurtured that LIFFE exchange. This world recently lost both gentlemen. And I hope that as they look down upon us, they regard my colleagues and I as worthy stewards of their vision. And I hope they smile along with us at our record interest rate derivative activity in the third quarter, up 50% year-over-year. Let me now turn the call back to our moderator, Lydia and we'll conduct a question-and-answer session until 9 :30 Eastern Time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Alex Kramm : I'm just going to start with an unanswerable question, I think, as I think about the energy business. As we think about the end of the year and into 2025, obviously, a lot of detail here in terms of the structural opportunities. And clearly, that's reflected in the open interest growth that we've seen and, obviously, volumes this year, too. But look, clearly, it's been a solid environment as well from a trading perspective, in particular, in the fourth quarter with some of the volatility we've seen from the Middle East. So clearly, there's been some beta help here as well. So I'm just wondering, I know it's very difficult, if you can separate the alpha and the beta a little bit and how you think about that heading into 2025, what's repeatable and where are you a little bit worried that the trading environment may not be as good? I know it's a lengthy question. Jeffrey Sprecher : Alex, this is Jeff. And since that's an unanswerable question, let's put the new guy on it and ask Stuart if he can handle it. Stuart Williams : Thanks, Jeff and thanks, Alex, for the question. It is a great question. Perhaps the way to think about this and I think you picked up on a really important point there, Alex, when you referenced open interest. So as unanswerable as it might be, open interest is always a good indicator of future volume because this is -- these are positions being placed by real market participants. And those positions will need to be managed in the future as markets evolve. But the other way we think about this is that there is a linkage between the geopolitical events which you referenced in your question which do create short-term volatility but which also creates often new supply chains which then will leverage other parts of that matrix product setup that we've got which spans energy types and geography and the environmental markets. So just giving you an example of that, one of the things we saw after Europe's efforts to remove Russian hydrocarbons from its supply chain, we saw new supply routes coming from the Middle East up into Europe which we've never foreseen when we first set up ICE Futures Abu Dhabi but that's what happened. And so what we find is a lot of these geopolitical events create different supply chain opportunities which continue to drive growth in different parts of our energy markets. The focus that we've had over the last 20 years, though, has been to create that network of markets that provides a pricing point at each geography, energy type and environmental touch point so that whatever happens, whether it's geopolitical, whether it's supply chain changes, however the market evolves, we have the opportunity to provide that tool to our customers and can benefit off the back of that. The other point I would make, just in closing the answer, is we're very clearly at an inflection point where the growth we've seen over the last 20 years in absolute energy consumption is set to continue. About 80% of the world's population lives in non-OECD countries which, on average, on a per capita basis, only uses 1/3 of the energy of the equivalent people living in OECD countries. Put differently, energy consumption could well double over the next 25 years according to many economists. And a lot of that is going to be in places in the developing world where contracts like JKM and TTF and Brent and Dubai and Murban are critical in managing price risks around those areas. So we feel pretty good about the opportunity ahead of us. But as you say, it's pretty difficult to quantify that. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Craig Siegenthaler : We had a question on the new partnership between ICE Bonds and MarketAxess. So how will this partnership enhance your liquidity pool and client value proposition? And will we see it translate into stronger market share trends? If I could just squeeze one more in. Could this lead down the road to a closer relationship with MarketAxess ranging from a full acquisition or a strategic minority equity investment? Christopher Edmonds : Craig, it's Chris Edmonds. Thanks for the question. I probably will avoid the second one you asked. But look, the partnership with MarketAxess, it really gives us an opportunity where we have a very unique client base that is different than the MarketAxess traditional client base. But there are different pools of liquidity because of what they represent. And so this gives the -- this combination gives us the ability for all of our clients to make sure they have access to the liquidity they're looking for. It's still early days but it has gone very well for both of us. We're both happy with it. I spoke with them yesterday. Things continue to progress in a positive way there. And we will look to add other instruments along the way as the market continues to evolve into the future. But like I said, I'll probably avoid the last question you asked there. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Budish with Barclays. Benjamin Budish : I just wanted to dig in a little deeper to the fourth quarter IMT guidance. It looks like -- at least I know you tend to be a little bit more conservative than the MBA forecast but they show sort of an expected pickup between refis and purchases together. So just curious if you could kind of comment on that. And then, maybe could you perhaps remind us how should we be thinking about your overall sensitivity to pickup in transactions given there's a minimum component? Like how would you describe the current level of activity? Are most of your customers below that minimum level such that incremental transactions don't add as much? Like how should we sort of be thinking about that in Q4 and into next year? Warren Gardiner : Yes, Ben, it's a good question and thank you for it. So in terms of the first part of that question, so the fourth quarter guidance, as I said, it does assume some -- a slower purchase market. And when we see that in every fourth quarter, generally speaking, that trends off and that generally happens in the first quarter as well for what it's worth. It just the weather, frankly, at the end of the day and to people looking at houses and buying houses. So that's a typical pattern that we see. I think in terms of how that compares to what the MBA may be expecting, I don't know that that has really captured the sharper move higher in interest rates and mortgage rates over the last few weeks. So there may be a little bit more of an aggressive assumption on what refinancing may be looking like in that particular period. And so, we base -- what we're looking at is really what we're seeing on the application front and what we're seeing on the closed loan front in terms of what we can see in the next quarter or so. So I think it's a pretty good guide in terms of what one would expect for the quarter given where we're a month through here and it generally takes sort of 30, 60 days to close a loan. So those application volumes can be pretty indicative of what this quarter will look like. On your second question, yes, look, we still have a significant portion of the customers that are under their minimums today. But each quarter, that's getting better. And in fact, the third quarter was the best in 2 years or so, over 2 years and that's been steadily improving throughout this year. So not only does an improving loan market help that but so does the fact that we have actually been renewing some of these customers towards lower minimums as well. And so the bar, if you will, is a little bit lower. And so we've seen that transaction getting better the last few quarters, albeit still small and customers are crossing over their minimums with that being a big reason why it's improving. But we are -- that is a big reason why we are actually outperforming in terms of our transaction revenue relative to the market is some of those customers crossing over that minimum, not paying transaction fees in the prior period and now paying transaction fees. And I think as that market normalizes, you're going to see that continue. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Dan Fannon : So Warren, another question for you, just on expenses. So curious about the step-up into 4Q, kind of what's driving that? And then I know it's early but thinking about the building blocks for '25, if you can kind of give us the framework to think about maybe versus previous years. And also in the context of the mortgage business, if we do see a pickup in activity, the incremental margin of that business as we think about volumes starting to pick up more materially with rates changing as we go into next year. Warren Gardiner : Thanks, Dan. Good question. So as I noted, in terms of the fourth quarter, there's about $10 million to $15 million of onetime expenses that you'll want to take out of that in terms of thinking about a core run rate. Those one-times were several items really across different areas of the business unrelated that kind of hit all towards -- that we incurred, if you will, or realized we were going to incur towards the end of this quarter. So I think if you take that, you're probably down to $970 million or so versus the $960 million we had this quarter. And the difference there is going to be on the SG&A side to a degree. We did have a little bit lower marketing and customer acquisition costs in the third quarter that should pick up a bit in the fourth quarter, a little bit higher professional services fees as well that will come in next quarter -- or in the fourth quarter, I should say. So I think as you're thinking about next year, the $970 million, that's probably a good jumping off point and to annualize that, of course and then think about a similar framework that we've used in the past. We're going to invest in our people, we'll invest in the business, the technology and continue to do that as you've seen us do in the last number of years. So I think it's -- that will be a fair way to be thinking about it as we move into next year. We'll, of course, give you more granular guidance when we get there. On your second question on the incremental margins, you're 100% right. As the transaction backdrop improves and the market backdrop improves for loan originations, those are -- it's somewhat similar, if not entirely similar to what you would expect and see in our futures business or the New York Stock Exchange, where the transaction revenues have pretty high incremental margins on them. So that will certainly be a benefit to the segment margin and to the overall margin as that loan market normalizes. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Allen with Citi. Chris Allen : I wanted to circle back a little bit on energy. Kind of curious where you see pockets of opportunity from a customer perspective, whether it's customers overseas trading U.S. benchmarks or natural gas moving into the crude markets. And then I also wanted to ask about the sustainable aviation fuel market. There's been reports about energy majors investing in Brazil. And just given ICE's position in sugar and energy, it seems like a great opportunity. So wondering how you think about that from a market development opportunity set. Stuart Williams : Chris, this is Stuart here. Thank you for the question. Starting with your question on the customer base, we're seeing, as you heard in my prepared remarks, we're seeing a significant increase and continued growth in our customer base. The participation in our markets, that's really 2 factors. We're seeing net new participants coming into our marketplace, particularly out in Asia as hedging strategies continue to mature out there. But we're also seeing participants pivot from markets they've been active in historically into new markets. So for example, people that have historically been trading a lot of Henry Hub on our very regular in our TTF market and getting involved there. In terms of how that mix evolves, more and more customers are having global exposures. One of the side effects of the globalization of gas is that gas players globally and particularly in the U.S., now that the U.S. is a major export of LNG, need to be cognizant of and have risks to manage in respect of prices, not just in the U.S. but globally. So we've got a lot of global producers in the U.S. that are now looking at both TTF numbers as well as Henry Hub numbers and indeed some of our basis numbers to figure out whether it's best to pipe that gas internally to whether it's for data center usage or other power usage in the U.S. or to export that in the form of LNG to whether it's Europe or Asia. So we're seeing a lot of our U.S. participants now actively trading and holding positions in markets like TTF and JKM. I think the other trend, just pivoting quickly to oil which has been very interesting, you'll recall that a few years ago, we set up a new market in the U.S. Gulf Coast to better reflect the export price of Permian WTI coming out of the U.S. Gulf Coast. And again, as the U.S. continues to export more and more Permian-grade WTI and as that grade is now linked into Brent, we're seeing a lot more physical participants in the U.S. Permian producers using our numbers to price their exports out of the U.S. Gulf Coast. You might have seen just this last week, the shale producer, Continental Resources, announced that it was switching its Permian pricing to ICE's HOU contract which is replacing a differential to WTI Cushing. So that's all pointing in a good direction at the increased participation. Just pivoting then to your second question around sustainable aviation fuel or SAF, it is definitely a market we're looking at. What I referenced in my prepared remarks around our biofuels markets which ICE is very active in, we're seeing strong growth there. So that will be the area that SAF plays into. And as you, again, you alluded to, we're seeing increasing correlation between the sugar markets and the energy markets as a decent chunk of that sugar supply ends up in energy. So you're quite right, this is an opportunity. It's early days in the SAF market. The market structure is still evolving in that space but we continue to monitor that as time goes on. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Jeff, a little bit of a maybe bigger-picture mortgage question for you guys. Obviously, you talked a lot about the progress you're making in sort of integrating various parts of the mortgage network. It's always been an important part of the thesis for you guys, lots of work behind the team -- scenes, sorry, despite the fact that the environment obviously hasn't been particularly helpful here. So when do you expect all these efforts to show up in better revenue growth? So in other words, do we need to see a much better, broader industry volumes to sort of kind of like beta help? Or do you think some of these things could actually show up in better revenue trajectory into 2025 regardless of what industry volumes look like? Jeffrey Sprecher : That's a good question. I tried to make a point in my prepared remarks that we really have moved to operating a network. And I made the point that every new market participant that joins the network makes the network more valuable to all the existing participants. And so that phenomenon is not really volume related. It's really helping others take costs out. And our expectation is that as we help reduce the cost of underwriting and placing a mortgage into the capital markets, that we'll participate in some of that benefit. Separately, Warren talks a lot about normalizing transaction volumes. And when we look at that, you can simply look over a decade before the COVID crisis or even back to year 2022 and you can see volumes that had they run through our platform would have contributed substantially to both the top and bottom line. So we do feel like there will be a mean reversion that will get to transactions. It's obviously hard to predict. But in the meantime, we're going to just keep driving that efficiency through the network. Operator : The next question comes from Simon Clinch with Redburn Atlantic. Simon Clinch : I wanted to actually ask a longer-term question just about the environmental markets, please. Perhaps you could -- could you frame the growth that we're seeing in terms of what the stages we're in, in terms of the emissions coverage of the schemes such as the European ETS? And then ultimately, how to think about the cadence of that growth as we move through the next 5 years? And then very long -- in the very long term, what -- how do we think about that market opportunity or that market existing in the point that we eventually get to net zero? Stuart Williams : Thanks, Simon. Good question. The -- I think the way we're thinking about this from a macro perspective and I'll drill down into your specific question on the European ETS, carbon pricing, well, our view as market operators is that carbon pricing is going to be the most effective way to help channel investments that are needed in order to drive the complete reduction of carbon. And we've seen this very effectively play out in the U.K. as the U.K. drove coal out of its merit order using carbon pricing, the European Union on a similar kind of trajectory. So what we're seeing over the last couple of years is the dialogue around the importance of pricing carbon and more broadly environmental externalities is evolving. More governments, more policymakers are engaging with the subject and seeing the benefits of cap-and-trade systems which have been so successful in Europe and the U.K. and also in certain areas of the U.S. And so we are seeing more discussions around more coverage of carbon markets. And then within existing carbon markets, touching on your question on the European ETS, we're seeing the broadening of the coverage of those carbon markets. So only about 40% of the European emissions was covered under the EU ETS. That is now being extended to 80% as the ETS extends to other parts of the industry like shipping and that sort of thing. So the underlying market, if you like, is expanding which is also driving additional volume there. And then, of course, the other nascent market in the space, if you think of the compliance markets as the one end of the spectrum, on the other end, the so-called voluntary carbon markets or the carbon credit markets is another area where we continue to see discussions. Market structure there, again, is still very nascent. But what we've been working on in the meantime is putting in place a number of the building blocks that will be required for that market to scale, if it is ever going to scale, things like reference data. So we've got a product called ICE CRED which normalizes and standardizes all of the reference data that's available across the carbon credit landscape. That reference data is now available in ICE Chat where we're seeing a lot of the transaction activity, really OTC bilateral trading activity of carbon credits, referencing that reference data. And we've also got a futures -- a number of futures contracts, including the CORSIA futures contract which we launched recently which is really the credit market used by the aviation industry. So again, that's the second part of the market which is much less mature but we are seeing increasing interest as participants start to engage with our reference data and with ICE Chat transactions on that front. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Ken Worthington : Stuart, more for you, trial by fire. If we think about the globalization of gas driving your TTF and JKM contracts, we're seeing the growth of TTF far exceed the LNG capacity that has come online in recent years. There's some sort of multiplier or maybe it's speculators following hedgers. So how do you think about this relationship between molecules in motion, the need to hedge and what ends up ultimately is, I guess, I'll call it, normalized volume? And if LNG capacity is going to double over the next 3 years, what is reasonable to expect for this LNG relationship with TTF and JKM which you called out as sort of a nonlinear relationship? Stuart Williams : Yes. Thanks for the question, Ken. I think the other dynamic to keep in mind when you're thinking about the volume on a futures contract versus the underlying market is the length of the curve. So we've got liquid pricing in TTF now going out 10 years. And so that's 10 years' worth of supply is the thing you need to be thinking about as you think about the hedging volumes on the exchange. But look, it's -- the thing that we -- the dynamic we're seeing is, as you said in your question, the demand for LNG is growing significantly and we see that as being a significant part of both the Asian growth story but also the Asian move to cleaner energies. So there's no question in our mind that LNG supply is going to need to increase significantly. The other dynamic here is because there is more liquid pricing in the marketplace, looking at the likes of TTF and JKM, more and more buyers and sellers are referencing TTF and JKM in the physical contracts. And so what that means is you're seeing less fixed price and more indexed transactions in the physical market which provides the optionality not just of taking LNG from point of production to point of demand but also you can, as you see in the oil market, have ships on route changing direction because odds have opened up. So what we're seeing in the gas market as part of this globalization story is a real modernization of the market structure where physical molecules are going to the best price. And as those prices evolve with greater transparency, those physical movements move with them. So net-net, what that means is there are more participants needing to hedge more molecules along more supply chain routes and we see that overall growing. And then again, to my earlier comments, liquidity down the curve is getting really strong. So we're seeing longer-dated hedging coming into the TTF contract as well. Operator : We're out of time for further questions. So I'll now hand you back to Jeff Sprecher, Chair and CEO, for any closing comments. Jeffrey Sprecher : Well, thank you, Lydia and thank you all for joining us this morning. We look forward to updating you again soon as we continue to innovate for our customers and continue our momentum to drive growth with an all-weather business model. And I hope that today, you avoid the witches and zombies and have a safe Halloween. Operator : This concludes our call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

After the prepared remarks there\u2019ll be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019ll now hand you over to Katia Gonzalez, Manager of Investor Relations to begin. Please go ahead. Katia Gonzalez : Good morning. ICE\u2019s fourth quarter 2024 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investor section of ice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today\u2019s call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2024 Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You\u2019ll find a reconciliation to the prevailing GAAP terms in our earnings materials. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, references to revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain items. With us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chair and CEO; Warren Gardiner, Chief Financial Officer; Ben Jackson, President; Lynn Martin, President of the NYSE; and Chris Edmonds, President of Fixed Income and Data Services. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Warren. Warren Gardiner : Thanks, Katia. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I\u2019ll begin on Slide 4 with a summary of our record 2024 results. Full year adjusted earnings per share totaled $6.07, an increase of 8% year-over-year, marking the best year in our company\u2019s history. For the full year, net revenues totaled a record $9.3 billion and pro forma for the acquisition of Black Knight increased by 6% versus last year. Full year adjusted operating expenses totaled $3,810 million, an increase of roughly 1% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. It\u2019s worth noting that in just 16 months following the close of Black Knight, we\u2019ve achieved run rate expense synergies of $175 million and now expect to reach our full synergy target of $200 million by the end of 2025. In addition, we are also raising our Black Knight expense synergy target to $230 million. This strong performance drove record full-year adjusted operating income of $5.5 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year. Moving to cash generation, this record operating performance contributed to full year free cash flow of $3.6 billion, of which we returned $1 billion to shareholders through dividends, while also reducing our leverage to under 3.3 times EBITDA versus 4.3 times upon the close of Black Knight in late 2023. As a result of the significant progress we have made on leverage, we now expect to begin repurchasing shares in the first quarter. Recall that we were -- we expect -- recall that we still expect and are on track to achieve leverage levels of approximately 3 times EBITDA. We will balance share repurchases with continued deleveraging until we reach this target, which we expect will occur later this year. Moving to Slide 5, I\u2019ll discuss our fourth quarter performance. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.52, up 14% versus last year. Fourth quarter net revenues of $2.3 billion increased 5% year-over-year, driven by transaction revenues of $1.1 billion and recurring revenues of $1.2 billion. Fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $973 million, $4 million below the low end of our guidance range, driven by reduced marketing and legal spend, as well as lower customer acquisition costs at the NYSE. Now let\u2019s move to Slide 6, where I\u2019ll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Fourth quarter net revenues totaled $1.2 billion, up 9% year-over-year. Transaction revenues of $883 million were up 13%, in part driven by record revenues across Interest Rates and our Global Energy business, which grew 38% and 16% year-over-year, respectively. Revenues within our global oil complex increased 11% year-over-year, while natural gas and environmental products, which represent nearly half of our Energy revenues, increased by 22% in the quarter, and were up 31% for the full year. In addition, 2025 is off to a strong start, with January volumes increasing 21% year-over-year, and total open interest up 11% year-over-year, including 13% growth in Global Energy and 17% growth in our Interest Rate business. Recurring revenues, which include our Exchange Data Services and our NYSE Listings business, totaled $353 million. The sequential decline in Exchange Data Services was largely driven by a one-time full year true up to our tape revenues at the NYSE, which we do not anticipate will repeat in 2025. As a result, we expect that Exchange Data and Connectivity Services revenues will rebound the $240 million to $245 million range in the first quarter. In our Listings business, while less than half of global ITOs met the standards to list on our exchange in 2024, the NYSE helped to raise $17 billion in new proceeds. Welcoming 53 new operating companies, including seven of the top 10 IPOs and nine of the top 10 best-performing IPOs. Looking to 2025, we expect that recurring revenues in our Exchange segment will grow in the low single-digit range, largely driven by continued growth in our futures data services. Turning now to Slide 7, I\u2019ll discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services segment. Fourth quarter revenues totaled $579 million, including transaction revenues of $108 million. Within our ICE bonds, lower tax loss harvesting activity relative to 2023 within our muni business offset growth in institutional corporates, while strong CDS clearing activity was offset by lower levels of member interest following two Fed cuts towards the end of 2024. Recurring revenues totaled a record $471 million and grew by 5% year-over-year. In our Fixed Income Data and Analytics business, record fourth quarter revenues of $301 million increased by 5%, driven by growth in pricing and reference data, and another quarter of double-digit growth in our Index business. Other Data and Network Services revenues also increased by 5% in the fourth quarter, driven by continued growth for both ICE Global Network and our Consolidated Feeds offering, as well as continued strength in our desktop solutions. Looking to 2025, supported by an ASV that exits the fourth quarter up 5% year-over-year, we anticipate mid-single-digit growth in our Fixed Income and Data Services recurring revenues. Please flip to Slide 8, where I\u2019ll discuss the results in our Mortgage Technology segment. Fourth quarter Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $508 million, slightly above the high end of our guidance range. Recurring revenues totaled $391 million. While down on a year-over-year basis, revenues improved relative to the third quarter, driven by growth in both our Servicing Solutions and our Data and Analytics business. Similar to prior quarters, while the majority of Encompass customers renewed at higher minimums, the improvement in recurring revenues was somewhat offset by customers that reduced minimums at renewal. Transaction revenues totaled $117 million, up 12% on a year-over-year basis, but as anticipated, were down slightly relative to the third quarter due to seasonality in the market, a dynamic that typically impacts both the fourth quarter and first quarter of each year. It\u2019s worth noting that according to ICE Mortgage Technology, we continue to see signs of market stabilization, as housing inventory continues to rise, up 20% in 2024, and annual home price appreciation slowed to the lowest levels since 2011. Moving to guidance for 2025, we anticipate that total IMT revenues will grow in the low single-digit to mid-single-digit range. The high end of the range is underpinned, in part, by low-teens\u2019 growth and industry origination volumes, which is similar to expectations set by the NBA, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, while the low end of the range assumes a more conservative origination backdrop that is flat with 2024 levels. At both ends of the range, we anticipate growth in recurring revenues due, in part, to a portion of the $55 million in total revenue synergies we have achieved beginning to come online. Please flip to Slide 9, where I\u2019ll provide some additional full year guidance. We expect 2025 adjusted operating expenses to be between $3,915 million and $3,965 million, an increase of roughly 3% year-over-year at the midpoint. Similar to prior years, we expect to invest in our people, our technology and growth initiatives across our business. With these investments somewhat offset by synergies related to Black Knight. Moving below the line, similar to last year, we currently expect the full year tax rate will be in the range of 24% to 26%. And finally, we expect full year CapEx to be in the range of $730 million to $780 million. As is typical in the case in years following an acquisition, CapEx is expected to be slightly elevated as we invest and reposition the acquired asset. In addition to these IMT-related investments, we will also make revenue-related investments in our data center footprint to meet growing customer demand for additional capacity. In summary, we delivered a very strong finish to another record year of revenues, operating income and free cash flow, and adjusted earnings per share. We invested across our business while also significantly reducing our leverage. As we kick off 2025, we\u2019re focused on once again delivering growth and creating shareholder value. I am happy to take your questions during Q&A, but for now, I\u2019ll hand it over to Ben. Ben Jackson : Thank you, Warren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 10. Across our futures markets, we\u2019ve worked for over two decades to build out the scope and depth of our multi-asset and multi-geography offering to allow for both flexibility and precision trading from wherever in the world customers choose to trade on ICE. As a result, a record of over 2 billion futures and options contracts traded on ICE in 2024, marking the highest volume year in ICE\u2019s history, including a record 1.2 billion commodity contracts and a record 753 million Interest Rate contracts. This strong performance contributed to the 12th consecutive year of record futures revenue in 2024, which grew 20%, including 15% in the fourth quarter. Across our Energy markets, we saw the importance of investing in a diverse and globally interconnected energy platform that better serves the needs of an evolving and growing commercial customer base. By working closely with our customers, we have built and continue to enhance our leading Global Energy network that delivers comprehensive risk management solutions, provides capital efficiencies and is positioned to grow alongside the continued evolution of global markets. All this while providing the critical price transparency across the Energy spectrum needed to navigate the Energy transition and to meet forward-looking demand. Over the last five years, revenue growth across our Energy markets has averaged 14% growth annually, with 2024 revenues reaching a record $1.9 billion, up 25% year-over-year. This strong performance was driven by record Energy volumes and is a testament to customers\u2019 continued confidence in ICE as the Global Energy hedging venue of choice. In our oil business, we offer key benchmark contracts such as Brent. As the global benchmark for crude oil, Brent prices roughly three quarters of the world\u2019s internationally traded crude and serves as the cornerstone of our global oil complex, which today includes over 800 locational and product spreads relied on by commercial customers. This innovation and evolution have enabled us to continue serving our global customers and to drive growth across the business, delivering record oil revenues in 2024, which grew 21% year-over-year. This strong performance was underpinned by the highest volume year for total oil contracts traded on ICE, including records across our Brent and gas oil benchmark contracts. In addition, as trade dynamics evolve and become increasingly complex, customers not only are seeking liquidity in the major global benchmarks, but also in products that provide greater hedging precision. This dynamic is illustrated by record trading activity in our other crude and refined products in 2024, with volumes of 34% year-over-year, including records across our Platts Dubai and Murban contracts. Our global oil offering sits alongside our global natural gas markets, where the globalization of this commodity is underpinned by the rise of liquefied natural gas or LNG. The ongoing liberalization of the LNG market has put more natural gas in motion over longer distances with a greater number of touchpoints along the value chain from production to consumption. At the same time, demand for natural gas continues to grow and likely sustainably for the foreseeable future. Trends that support this are the undeniable secular growth in overall energy demand, increased demand for data centers and the associated power that goes with it, and the move to gas as a cleaner fossil fuel source versus coal. In essence, this evolution creates opportunities for new trading relationships to develop and adds an extra layer of complexity that fuels adoption to our global gas product suite. This was illustrated by record market participation in our global gas complex in 2024, which has increased nearly 30% since 2019. As supply chains evolve and globalize, the quality of our expansive range of benchmarks is evident with our natural gas business delivering another year of record revenues in 2024, increasing 30% versus last year. This strong performance was led by record revenues in our Title Transfer Facility benchmark or TTF, which we have positioned as the Brent of natural gas and plays a critical role in providing global natural gas price signals. As a result, TTF continues to be relied upon by an increasing number of market participants with market participation and volumes both setting new highs in 2024 and each growing double digits on average over the past five years. In Asia, where coal still accounts for nearly half of the region\u2019s energy supply, our Japan-Korea marker, JKM, has seen market participation grow double digits on average over the past five years, reaching a record in 2024 and increasing 27% year-over-year. As a cleaner alternative to coal, natural gas has accelerated the global risk management needs related to the commodity and caused the markets across North America, Europe, and Asia to become increasingly interconnected. This dynamic was once again highlighted by JKM volume execution trends in the fourth quarter with two-thirds of JKM volume executed via the JKM-TTF spread. In North America, as market participants continue to gravitate towards ICE\u2019s Henry Hub contracts for the liquidity ICE offers in longer-dated tenors, along with the linkage to our exclusive regional basis markets, volumes in our complex grew 30% year-over-year, including record volumes across our basis markets, which span 70 hubs across North America, allowing customers to manage regional supply and demand dynamics. Trading alongside our global oil, gas and power markets, our leading environmental markets, which were first launched nearly two decades ago, provide customers price transparency across the Energy spectrum that is critical in navigating the clean energy transition. Here, we\u2019ve seen market participation grow double digits on average over the past five years, including record participation in 2024, up 13% versus prior year. At the same time, record volumes across the complex were up 39% year-over-year, led by another record-setting year in our North American environmental markets. These record volumes represent the equivalent of over $1 trillion in notional value for the fourth consecutive year and contributed to a 40% increase in environmental revenues in 2024 versus the prior year. In summary, the evolution of our Energy markets is one example of how we continuously invest and develop customer-driven solutions across asset classes to drive value creation. Our record performance is a product of these investments, some that we\u2019ve made more than a decade ago. Turning now to our Fixed Income and Data Services business on Slide 11. Driven by multiyear investments in both technology and data, our comprehensive Fixed Income Data platform continues to deliver compounding revenue growth. Our position as a leading provider of price and reference data has served as the foundation for many innovative solutions, such as our rapidly growing Index franchise, a business we built through both organic and inorganic investments, including our acquisitions of IDC and the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Index Platform. In 2024, revenues in our Index business increased double digits year-over-year. A key driver was growth in ETF assets under management benchmark to ICE indices of 13% year-over-year. Collectively, the strong performance across our PRD and Index business drove 5% growth in our Fixed Income Data and Analytics business in 2024. In addition, we continue to see returns on past investments made to enhance content and functionality across our Other Data and Network Services business, which grew 5% in 2024 versus prior year. As an example, within our Consolidated Feeds business, investments we\u2019ve made to elevate and enhance our offering, including commodity and energy data now available on our feeds has led to accelerating adoption by large financial institutions, including displacements of larger multi-asset class incumbents. This was a key contributor to the high single-digit revenue growth in this area in 2024. With content from over 600 data sources, as firms seek more high quality data from a range of different sources in a cost effective manner and access to new unique content, our competitive and comprehensive offering stands to benefit. Finally, as we move forward, we remain focused on continuing to leverage our deep expertise in gathering and cleansing unstructured data to develop actionable insights and add transparency, not only to the Fixed Income markets, but across asset classes. For example, in 2024, we announced the integration of our property and loan level Mortgage data sets with our property level climate risk metrics covering more than 100 million U.S. homes. This solution improves transparency and facilitates risk management throughout the housing, finance and property insurance sector, allowing customers to apply ICE\u2019s climate metrics to individual loans, properties and entire portfolios, improving the visibility to the inherent climate risks in each. We also went live with our MBS mortality indicator, which leverages data sets across ICE Data Services and ICE Mortgage Technology to produce daily trading signals for more than 900,000 agency and residential MBS pools. Shifting now to our Mortgage business on Slide 12. Like our Exchanges and Fixed Income businesses, ICE Mortgage Technology\u2019s products and network excel by offering a value proposition that enables efficiency gains for our customers. We target asset classes that are in the early stages of an analog to digital conversion because we believe these asset classes will benefit from greater automation and create strong network effects. This is no different in Mortgage, where we\u2019ve constructed an unparalleled network that seamlessly connects key stake -- industry stakeholders within a single end-to-end digital ecosystem. That kind of connectivity and network is a hallmark of the ICE business model and one that combined with our leading solutions gives us confidence that we can grow a business that at $2 billion today is only a fraction of the $14 billion addressable market that\u2019s in the early days of an analog to digital conversion. In 2024, we continue to make progress on the successful integration of Black Knight and executing on our strategy of relieving the pain points and inefficiencies across the Mortgage workflow. Starting with Encompass, we closed on 38 client wins in the fourth quarter as customers focus on modernizing their infrastructure and our workflow efficiencies, and to kick off the year, we\u2019re pleased to announce that Flagstar and Howard Hanna have signed on as Encompass clients. In parallel, we delivered on several enhancements to Encompass during last year, including a launch of multi-channel support for web-based loan manufacturing and are pleased to see clients are adopting this innovation. We also unified our industry-leading marketing and sales automation solutions into one complete customer acquisition and retention suite. We also added a borrower-facing mobile application to support lenders on our platform. Then we embedded these into Encompass workflows directly, enabling our lender clients to efficiently identify customers to target with the right products at the right time and manage their leads through to closing. This helped to drive over 200 cross-sells of our customer acquisition suite into Encompass customers in 2024. Along the same lines, we integrated datasets from Black Knight into Encompass, including property tax, flood and closing fees, providing customers with more choice of service providers on our platform and are pleased by the early traction across these offerings, executing on over 400 data cross-sells to Encompass clients in 2024. Along the same lines and consistent with our approach of investing ahead of secular growth, throughout 2024, we dramatically enhanced our ICE Product and Pricing Engine or PPE, and look forward to showcasing this enhanced offering at our upcoming ICE Experience Event, an annual gathering of thousands of customers where each year we launch our new and enhanced innovations for our clients. For MSP, roughly 80% of new client wins during the year were cross-sells to Encompass clients. We also continue to make significant strides in enhancing functionality designed to elevate customer interactions and experiences, including the rollout of our MSP Digital Experience or MSP DX. At the same time, we enhanced and integrated our loss mitigation, customer service and collections capabilities. These embedded tools within MSP not only streamline operations, but help clients prepare for the eventual increase in defaults and foreclosures. Our customer service enhancements improve the customer experience, and as an example, our call prediction functionality uses artificial intelligence to analyze the account and provide a prediction of why the customer is calling, allowing the customer service agent to reach a resolution in decreased timeframe and reduce friction to the homeowner. Lastly, our Actionable Intelligence Platform or AIP, which is in the process of being rebranded as ICE Business Intelligence, provides robust analytical and reporting capabilities based on configurable suites for originators and servicers. Originators will be able to view dashboards to manage all aspects of production, including marketing, sales, pipelines and closing through all channels, including retail, wholesale and correspondence. Servicers will have sophisticated risk management, compliance and capacity planning tools that will help them better manage portfolios and coordinate activities across the enterprise. By delivering timely and actionable insights, our Business Intelligence Platform will help enable financial institutions to stay agile and competitive in a continually evolving market, all while seamlessly integrating with existing systems for ease of adoption. In that regard, we are pleased to announce that we signed a top five depository onto this service in 2024 and we continue to see other clients engage in this solution suite based on the efficiencies and revenue opportunities it can help uncover. In summary, we are pleased to see the value of our comprehensive platform is resonating in the marketplace and we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity to accelerate the analog to digital conversion. With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Jeff. Jeff Sprecher : Thank you, Ben, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 13. Over two decades ago, we launched Intercontinental Exchange, a name we chose to reflect our vision of better serving global markets with a mission to drive transparency and create workflow efficiencies for our customers. The pursuit and execution of this vision first led us to Energy markets, where at the time of our 2005 IPO on the New York Stock Exchange, we were purely an Energy exchange, offering only a handful of products and on track to generate what would ultimately be $156 million in total revenue. Our goal then, as it remains today, was to build a platform that operated on a global scale and which had the asset class breadth to enable us to quickly and efficiently chase growth opportunities as they emerged around the world. In the years since, our focus on leading technology, customer-driven product innovation and operating efficiency has remained core to our strategy. We\u2019ve built new technology from scratch, acquired old technology and refurbished it, and innovated all along the way, developing countless new products and content that seamlessly flow through a global distribution platform, enabling us to build on the success of our core businesses while looking ahead to new opportunities. In many ways, this is how we\u2019ve built what I often refer to as our all-weather business model, one that drives growth on top of growth through an array of economic, political and regulatory environments, with 2024 marking our 19th consecutive year of record revenues, increasing 16% year-over-year to $9 billion. Through deliberate, organic and inorganic investments that we\u2019ve made, some more than a decade ago and others in more recent years, such as our Midland HOU contract, our leading Global Energy network today spans more than 2,000 contracts. It\u2019s a business that, as you\u2019ve just heard, continues to flourish more than 20 years later, with revenues tripling since 2010 to a record $1.9 billion in 2024, an increase of 25% year-over-year on top of 28% prior annual growth. Building on our Energy business as the foundation, we\u2019ve targeted an interrelated collection of markets to create a global risk management powerhouse that helps our customers manage risk associated to both acts of nature, such as issues that affect commodity supply chain flows, and acts of man, such as central bank and cross-border trade policies. In 2013, through the acquisition of the London International Financial Futures Exchange known as LIFFE, and subsequently combining it with our own local commodity exchange in clearinghouse, we broadened our offering to manage the risk resulting from both types of forces. And in 2024, our commodity markets, as well as our Interest Rate derivatives complex all traded at record levels, highlighting the key role that these contracts continue to play for global market participants. Across our Interest Rate contract portfolio, diverging rate paths by Central Banks was a consistent theme throughout 2024, contributing to record revenues, which increased 30% versus 2023, including 38% growth in the fourth quarter. These results highlight the strength of our multi-currency European, U.K. and Swiss Interest Rate markets, including the key benchmarks Euribor, SONIA, SARON and Gilts. In 2015, our acquisition of IDC proved to be instrumental and laid the foundation for our move into Fixed Income markets and the development of a comprehensive platform that has since evolved into nearly 500 unique institutional-grade data products, one that continues to deliver compounding revenue growth as these markets automate and as passive investing grows. In our Index business, ETF AUM benchmark to our indices has grown to $648 billion at the end of 2024, from less than $100 billion in 2017, a key driver of the double-digit average annual revenue growth over that time frame. Fixed income and its related data is an area where we continue to make strategic decisions to position ourselves for success. For example, in 2024, we announced our intention to launch a clearing service for all U.S. Treasury securities and repurchase agreements, leveraging our infrastructure and expertise in centralized clearing. And in early January, we announced our acquisition of the American Financial Exchange or AFX, an electronic exchange for direct lending and borrowing for American banks and financial institutions. AFX has focused on regional, midsize and community bank customers, covering many of the same customers that we serve through our Mortgage Technology Network, making AFX a natural fit at ICE, and complementing both our Mortgage Network and ICE\u2019s growing Index business. Across our Mortgage business, much like our strategy and other asset classes, we\u2019re leveraging our data, technology and collective expertise to bring efficiencies to the entire Mortgage manufacturing workflow. And as Ben pointed out, we continue to make strides executing against this strategy, digitizing the workflow from home buyer identification all the way through to the capital markets. In 2024, we added many new clients to the Mortgage network while also deepening relationships with our longstanding customers. As we look to 2025 and beyond, the new U.S. administration has pledged to increase U.S. energy production, which could change the supply chain dynamics of the world\u2019s energy supply, and resultingly, the global risk that will need to be managed. We believe that energy demand growth, particularly in Asia, the power deregulation trends in Japan, increases in U.S. energy exports and the multi-decade non-linear energy transition all point to the growing use of market-based commodity pricing and risk management tools. And with new governments in the U.K. and EU Commission, as well as in the U.S., we expect novel policy decisions that will impact inflation and employment, which could drive continued demand for Interest Rate risk management in 2025. Also, when thinking about the current robust AI investment environment, particularly in the U.S., coupled with uncertain Central Bank Interest Rate policies and the potential demands for energy by this sector, these trends could further the need for commodity risk management while continuing to stimulate trading in equity markets. From helping our customers navigate the long-tail evolution of commodity markets to the digitization of Fixed Income workflows and automating Mortgage placement, it\u2019s our operating expertise, leading technology infrastructure and forward thinking that underpin the quality of the network that we operate, proving to be our competitive advantage and providing the opportunity to unlock additional growth by collaborating across customers and our own business units. We believe that we\u2019re better positioned than ever to capitalize on these secular and cyclical trends across asset classes, and we remain focused on investing and executing on the many growth opportunities that are in front of us. In summary, for more than 20 years, ICE has continually evolved to meet the needs of our customers and provide value for our stockholders. In that vein, 2024 marked our 19th consecutive year of record revenues, record operating income and record adjusted earnings per share. This consistent record of growth reflects on the quality of our strategy to diversify the business and position the company at the center of some of the largest industries undergoing analog to digital conversions, a strategy that has created an all-weather business model that is well-positioned to continue to drive growth as it has for every year since we\u2019ve been a public company. I\u2019d like to thank our customers for their business and their trust in 2024, and I want to thank my colleagues for the efforts that contributed to yet another record year at ICE. I\u2019ll now turn our call back to our moderator, Lydia, and we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session until 9.30 a.m. Eastern Time. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ken Worthington : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. When we look at the new client wins in Mortgage, both on the origination and servicing side, there would seem to be a lot of new business getting up and running all at the same time after a period of limbo between when Black Knight was announced and closed. Can you give us a sense of the cadence of the big new customer wins going live for MSP and Encompass? Are they front-end loaded, back-end loaded, as we think about this year and how does the new customer wins sort of contribute to the guidance that you gave us for 2025? Ben Jackson : Hey, Ken. This is Ben. I\u2019ll start, and then Warren will probably take the last part of that question. So, recall we closed on Black Knight roughly 18 months ago. And since then, we have closed, as you highlighted, a number of very significant large financial institutions onto both Encompass and onto MSP. We\u2019ve also highlighted that it takes anywhere from 12 months to 18 months for those clients to come online, get through all their testing. This is all absolutely critical infrastructure, as you well know. And then once they start to come online, they\u2019ll roll it out division-by-division. So, it takes time to make these changes happen. Because the deal closed about 18 months ago, we\u2019re right now in that window where, in 2025, we are going to have a number of clients that we closed in those windows coming live as this year plays out and I think it\u2019s -- you\u2019re going to see it coming in and building as the year plays out. Warren Gardiner : Yeah. Ken, I\u2019ll just add to that, too. That\u2019s right. We\u2019ll start to see those. That\u2019s what we talked to you guys about throughout the years. We\u2019d start to see these impact 2025. And part of the reason we saw some stabilization towards the fourth quarter in the recurring revenue is because some of these are starting to come online, too. And so, I think we\u2019re at a point where we can start to grow from here. I think one thing just to call out, too, is that while all that\u2019s good and we have that coming online, there are still a little bit of some headwinds. There is the flag star attrition that should happen towards the end of the year. That\u2019s probably a 0.5 point in terms of an impact on our growth rate. And then we also still will expect some headwinds from renewals on Encompass is particularly related to 2020 and 2021 vintage that you\u2019ve heard us talk about throughout last year. Got a little bit more of that to go. That\u2019s probably from a growth rate percentage, probably a low single-digit impact for us, but an improvement from what we saw last year. So, there\u2019s some moving parts in there, but absolutely, as Ben said, we\u2019re starting to see some of the impact from those winds come online and that will help us this year and then into next year as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Blostein : Hey. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for your questions. Well, I was hoping we could spend a couple of minutes on trends you\u2019re seeing in WTI markets within your oil complex. ICE made a nice progress gaining market share over the course of last year. It looks like trends have picked back up again on the market share trend versus your primary competitor there. So, what\u2019s driving that? How durable that is? How do you expect that marketplace and that ecosystem to evolve as you progress through 2025 and 2026? Ben Jackson : Hi, Alex. It\u2019s Ben. I\u2019ll take this one. We\u2019re pleased with the overall growth of our entire oil complex. It\u2019s done very, very well over the last several years now. And a lot of what I think has fed into what\u2019s made WTI -- our WTI successful is innovations that we launched a few years back. So, one innovation in particular was our Midland WTI HOU contract that we\u2019ve talked about and highlighted. That contract is literally up 200% on a year-over-year basis to start this year and had a phenomenal year last year as well. Another interesting data point on that Midland WTI HOU contract is that it\u2019s a truly physically delivered contract that\u2019s supported by a lot of the big oil companies. And the amount of physical deliveries that we saw on our contract are double what our peer saw on WTI. So, it\u2019s a testament to the fact that the physical underpinning and structural pieces of this market are very strong. And this is pricing Midland WTI oil basis Houston that\u2019s now also flowing into the Brent contract and also flowing into Europe as well. So, given all those dynamics, a lot of traders when they\u2019re trading, they\u2019ll trade, as you know, they\u2019ll trade basis amongst other contracts. And the fact that we have Brent, we have the WTI HOU contract and we have our own WTI contract, clients that want to trade this for maximum efficiency can trade all of those as a package or a subset of those as a package and we think that\u2019s what\u2019s feeding into a lot of the growth in our WTI contract. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Moley with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Patrick Moley : Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So, I just want to follow up on the Mortgage guide, the low-to-mid single revenue growth this year. Warren, you said that I think the high end of that would imply a low-teens pickup in origination activity and that\u2019s in line with what the industry forecasts are currently projecting. I think, that growth number though is projecting around 30% growth in refi activities. So, could you talk about, how you\u2019re thinking about the dynamics between refi versus purchase activity next year, just kind of through the lens of that Mortgage guide you provided? Thanks. Warren Gardiner : Sure. Thanks, Patrick. So, look, I think that based on where rates are today, that certainly to see that kind of refi growth might be a little optimistic, but we did want to incorporate that view into our guidance. And that\u2019s why we do also give you a more conservative sort of low end of the range in terms of what things could look like. It\u2019s obviously difficult to predict, particularly the refi market and what you might see on an Interest Rate perspective and impact there. So, look, I think, we\u2019re seeing some improvement on the purchase side in terms of the fundamentals. I noted that in my script in terms of some inventory, more inventory coming onto the market, some price appreciation slowing and things of that nature. We\u2019ll have to sort of see how refis trend, and that will, as you know, largely depend on how the trajectory of Interest Rates. So, I tried to give you kind of a wide band in terms of what the year could look like from an origination perspective. But even within both ends of those -- that band, I think, we\u2019ve got some good growth that\u2019s coming through. And importantly, the recurring revenues will start to grow too as well. So, hard to know exactly how that\u2019s all going to play out. But I think through that, we\u2019ve got an opportunity here to continue to invest in the business, advance the industry and really put our platform on a better footing as we move throughout the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Budish with Barclays. Please go ahead. Ben Budish : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Warren, I was wondering if you\u2019d give a little bit more color on the timing of some of the expense synergies. Curious if you could kind of quantify what is the sort of year -- thinking about the pacing of the expense synergies you\u2019re realizing this year, what is sort of the year-over-year benefit embedded in your full year OpEx guidance, and given the increased expectation for now, I think, $230 million. Should we think about that as being layered in over the course of 2026 or sort of achieved towards the beginning of 2026 so we see a bigger year-over-year benefit? So just curious if you could help us with the sort of pacing of those savings? Warren Gardiner : Sure. So I think as you\u2019re thinking about the impact for this year, obviously, we had a big year, well, really in 2023. So got to go back a little bit. And so a lot of the synergies, because we were very quick at the close of the deal to get these groups together and bring these groups together, we were able to realize a lot of the synergies in the third quarter and the fourth quarter of 2023, and then, of course, a little bit more in 2024 as well. Part of what you\u2019re also seeing as you kind of move throughout the year sequentially is that we\u2019re starting to invest in the business once we\u2019ve gotten those organizations in the right spot. And so, there\u2019s a lot of that is in the run rate, if you will, already in terms of the synergies that we\u2019ve spoken to. And so I think if you think about next year, there\u2019s a little bit of help there. Obviously, on a run rate basis, we\u2019ve got it to about $25 million of help, some of that\u2019s going to come towards the end of this year. So it won\u2019t be necessarily fully run rate impact, have a full run rate impact this year. And so as you\u2019re thinking about that, it\u2019ll be a help. It\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing our expense guidance overall kind of more towards the lower end of what the organic constant currency guidance in the past has been excluding synergies at 3%. So it\u2019s helping us a little bit there. In terms of, the go-forward and the $230 million, the extra $30 million that we\u2019ve added, a lot of that\u2019s going to come in later years. That\u2019s a lot of that is related to systems and infrastructure and real estate and things of that nature that just takes time to position and get those cost savings out. So no change to the timeframe necessarily in terms of reaching by 2028, but certainly an increase, of course, in the total amount we can achieve. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the Fixed Income Data outlook mid-single-digit growth again. Can you talk to kind of the inputs there, whether it\u2019s pricing, new customer growth, new products? We can see the ASV, some good dynamics, I guess, ending this year, but can you talk about maybe any changes in demand trends or the outlook that\u2019s shifting as we think about 2025 versus last year? Chris Edmonds : Hi. This is Chris. And thanks for the question. What I would say right now is you\u2019re seeing a trend within the space of clients, probably more by side than anything related, where they are very focused on the number of vendors that they are doing business with and looking for the growth -- most robust catalog of services available, so they can limit the amount of investment needed in order to consume the data and they need to run the business. And there\u2019s also a massive focus on predictability of cost, something we hear each and every day when engaging with the clients on that side. So given our robust catalog, given the fact we\u2019re connected to most of these people, that is generating opportunities that we\u2019re seeing. And probably as a headwind, if you are a smaller data provider that has maybe one or two of the segments that someone\u2019s looking for versus a much wider piece of that, that gives us opportunity and looking forward. I\u2019ll turn the other over to Warren. He can talk about the numeric piece of it. Warren Gardiner : Yeah. Dan, so I think, look, the guidance we gave, it\u2019s pretty consistent with the last several years in terms of what we expect. And I think you look at the ASV as we exit the fourth quarter, 5.4% certainly sets up for another good year. And I think we\u2019ll have a solid year from both business lines within that recurring revenue, within the recurring revenues that we have. And I think particularly, one thing that we don\u2019t always talk about a whole lot, but the Other Data and Network Services business, it\u2019s been around 5% the last few quarters. I think that certainly can set up for a little bit of pickup as we move through throughout the course of next year, in part because of some of the investments you\u2019ve heard us talking about on the data center side. So very happy with where that business has ended this year and where we\u2019re in the setup for next year, both on the Other Data and Network Services side and the Fixed Income and Data Analytics side as well. So, again, another, I think, solid year coming in 2025. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Allen with Citi. Your line\u2019s open. Chris Allen : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to maybe follow up on the Energy markets. I\u2019m kind of curious how you think the new administration policies may impact the Energy markets from your perspective, whether it\u2019s creating any new potential opportunities for your business moving forward or maybe potential headwinds. And then, Ben, any new -- any color, you mentioned the opportunity trading relationships, maybe in terms of what type of customers you\u2019re looking at there. Jeff Sprecher : This is Jeff. A couple things. First of all, we\u2019ve talked a lot on this call already about our Houston WTI contract, which is really an export contract. And we\u2019re hearing the administration say they want to amplify U.S. production, which we think will affect the export markets and play well into risk management using that contract. The other thing that we\u2019re beginning to hear a lot about from the administration is how sanctions might be used and tariffs on other countries. And again, we -- that may affect the global supply chain for energy. One of the takeaways from the European Energy markets over the last few years was how quickly the Energy markets are able to reorganize the supply chains. And we\u2019ve been investing in the Middle East in our Murban contract and in our Abu Dhabi Exchange, which we think the risk management dynamics around the changing supply chains can have a positive effect for that contract as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KPW. Please go ahead. Kyle Voigt : Actually, maybe I could just follow up on the prior question and continue discussion specifically on Dutch TTF. You\u2019ve seen significant growth in TTF over the past few years. OIs doubled in the past two years alone. As you just noted, there were some -- some of this has been driven by changes in supply chains post-Russia-Ukraine as well as growth of U.S. LNG into Europe. There have been some recent press headlines around the EU contemplating restarting Russia gas imports if there\u2019s a resolution to the war. I\u2019m just wondering if you could speak to how that would potentially impact Dutch TTF and whether it changes anything with respect to the importance or utilization of that benchmark? Ben Jackson : Thanks, Kyle. It\u2019s Ben. We\u2019ve built our business in all of the commodities that we cover as global businesses and that\u2019s how we\u2019ve differentiated ourselves with hundreds, if not thousands, of contracts around the world to help customers manage their risks at the point of production and consumption. Part of the reason that we did this alongside of partnering with our customers is that supply chains do evolve and they do change. And right now, we\u2019re in a situation where Ukraine has ceased all Russian gas going through the Ukraine into Continental Europe. Could that change? Yes, it could. For us, when we look at the open interest trends in our contracts and look at the open interest trends in TTF, it\u2019s an incredibly healthy business, incredibly healthy contract for us. If you step back to when the Ukraine war started, our open interest in that contract held in, but trading volumes went depressed for a little bit until it was -- until the market kind of reset and supply chains reset. And then, because we believe, because the open interest held strong and continued to grow even during that window, that once the supply chains reset, the market knew how to price and to think about supply and demand dynamics, that the contract has seen explosive growth. So we view it as a positive as these supply chains evolve and change. Jeff Sprecher : And with TTF becoming a real benchmark, as Ben mentioned. And so as the supply chain trades away potentially and moves around the world, we would expect that those pair relationships would continue to do robust volume. That\u2019s partly how the market has been managing these supply chain differences. Operator : The next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead. Alex Kramm : Yeah. Hey. Good morning, everyone. Maybe just a quick one here. You talked about the AFX acquisition a little bit in passing, and I know it\u2019s small, but maybe you can just give us a little bit more color on what you expect to do with that asset. I mean, you talked about similar clients as in Mortgage, obviously, its Interest Rates. So maybe you talk about your U.S. Interest Rate ambitions more broadly, because you\u2019ve talked about this over time, but you\u2019re not very big there. And then maybe for Warren, is there actually revenue contribution and where will that show up? Thank you. Chris Edmonds : Hey, Alex. It\u2019s Chris. So, consisting of what we\u2019ve done with other asset classes and other offerings around the history of ICE, it\u2019s making sure that we can find things to tuck in that where customers need. And you look at the overlap of that customer base and how that product\u2019s being used, we do think there are opportunities there for us to expand the use of those services all the time and create a little bit more transparency for those current users and those within the Mortgage space as a whole that may wish to use it in the future. Certainly, it\u2019s another product that we have in the inventory for folks to use where they do not have to leave our ecosystem in order to go out and manage the risk they may be facing or manage the book that they have there. So, it\u2019s still early days and putting that into the process, but we look forward to growing that like we have many other products throughout the history of the company as they fit hand in glove with other pieces that we have. Warren Gardiner : And Alex, it\u2019s Warren. So, it\u2019s an immaterial amount of total revenue today. And so, it\u2019s a small amount. So, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll see much of an impact. It will be in the Fixed Income and Data Services segment and the Exchange component of that would be on ICE bond side. And then, the Index component will be more on that. It will, of course, be in the Index business, which is in Fixed Income Data and Analytics business line. Operator : The next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC. Please go ahead. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks for taking my question. I had a question on the Mortgage business. How are the contract minimums on average for Encompass compared to the Mortgage origination levels in 2024 or another way would be how much do transactions volume have to improve to get full benefit of the spring from that Mortgage recovery? Thanks. Warren Gardiner : Ashish, it\u2019s Warren. So, I think the way to think about this, well, let me back. So, right now, as we kind of move through this year, we still have the, I would say, the vast minority of customers or sort of loans from our customers that are above the minimum. So, there\u2019s still a relatively small amount that are trending above the minimum. But over the last several quarters, that\u2019s been improving, and actually, the last few quarters have been some of the best quarters in terms of the percent above the minimum that we\u2019ve seen in a number of years. So, we\u2019re heading in the right direction on that and that\u2019s in part because the market\u2019s gotten a little bit better. But then -- and also, as you\u2019ve heard us note on calls, that the minimums have been coming down for a number of the customers as they\u2019ve renewed. So, that\u2019s been sort of a dual impact that\u2019s helping on that front. I think I\u2019d point you back in terms of how to think about the impact, I\u2019d point you back to some comments that we\u2019ve made a few quarters ago, which is if we\u2019re in a $7 million to $10 million loan environment at an industry level, we\u2019d expect revenues to be a couple $100 million to up to close to around $0.5 billion in terms of incremental revenue in those two scenarios. And so, as we move into a more normal market, and for what it\u2019s worth, $10 million loans has kind of been the average over the last 30 years. The median has been around $8 million loans. So, as we move back toward the more normal market, you\u2019re going to certainly start to see that impact flow through a little bit more on the transaction side as that impacts those contracts. Operator : The next question comes from Bill Katz with TD Cowen. Your line\u2019s open. Robin Holby : Good morning. This is Robin Holby on for Bill Katz and thank you for taking the question. We wanted to get your comments on Interest Rate volumes and open interest. Is there anything structural that you\u2019re doing or have done to drive the robust volume and open interest growth here? And where do you see the opportunities or potential headwinds for the rates business in 2025? Thank you. Ben Jackson : Hi. It\u2019s, excuse me. Hi. It\u2019s Ben. We\u2019re very pleased with the growth that we\u2019ve seen in our Interest Rate complex over the last couple of years and even starting into this year, they\u2019re off to a fantastic start. So, we obviously have a multi-currency Interest Rate complex that we\u2019ve built up. We continue to invest in options and development of options markets around all of our Interest Rate futures, which has also helped in the development of those contracts. And we continue to invest in making sure that we\u2019re getting the best market participants into these markets to create tight liquid markets for our clients. So, those are some of the things that we\u2019ve done. I think that as it relates to persistent Interest Rate volatility that\u2019s going on around the world, obviously, we had a bunch of administration changes around the world. Jeff alluded to in his comments and his prepared remarks around acts of man and the impact that has. So, with the administration changes happening, settling in, we\u2019ll see what that means in terms of Central Bank policy and trade policies as they develop, all of which we think should feed volatility into the Interest Rate markets globally and we\u2019re well positioned for it. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019re out of time for further questions. So, I\u2019ll pass you back to Jeff Sprecher, Chair and CEO, for closing comments. Jeff Sprecher : Well, thank you, Lydia, for moderating the call and thank you all for joining us this morning. We\u2019ll look forward to updating you again very soon. We\u2019re going to continue to innovate for customers and continue to drive this all-weather business model that we\u2019ve been building. With that, I hope you\u2019ll have a great day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you very much for joining. You may now disconnect your line.",
